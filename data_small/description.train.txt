Akhil has many balls of white and black colors. One day, he was playing with them. During the play, he arranged the balls into two rows both consisting of N number of balls. These two rows of balls are given to you in the form of strings X, Y. Both these string consist of 'W' and 'B', where 'W' denotes a white colored ball and 'B' a black colored.  Other than these two rows of balls, Akhil has an infinite supply of extra balls of each color. he wants to create another row of N balls, Z in such a way that the sum of hamming distance between X and Z, and hamming distance between Y and Z is maximized. Hamming Distance between two strings X and Y is defined as the number of positions where the color of balls in row X differs from the row Y ball at that position. e.g. hamming distance between "WBB", "BWB" is 2, as at position 1 and 2, corresponding colors in the two strings differ..  As there can be multiple such arrangements of row Z, Akhil wants you to find the lexicographically smallest arrangement which will maximize the above value.   Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows: First line of each test case will contain a string X denoting the arrangement of balls in first row Second line will contain the string Y denoting the arrangement of balls in second row.   Output  For each test case, output a single line containing the string of length N denoting the arrangement of colors of the balls belonging to row Z.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 3   Example Input: 1 WBWB WBBB  Output: BWBW   Explanation Example case 1. As we know, Hamming Distance(WBWB, BWBW) + Hamming Distance(WBBB, BWBW) = 4 + 3 = 7. You can try any other value for string Z, it will never exceed 6. 
 There's an array A consisting of N non-zero integers A1..N. A subarray of A is called alternating if any two adjacent elements in it have different signs (i.e. one of them should be negative and the other should be positive).  For each x from 1 to N, compute the length of the longest alternating subarray that starts at x - that is, a subarray Ax..y for the maximum possible y ≥ x. The length of such a subarray is y-x+1.   Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T - the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains N. The following line contains N space-separated integers A1..N.   Output For each test case, output one line with N space-separated integers - the lengths of the longest alternating subarray starting at x, for each x from 1 to N.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 -10^9 ≤ Ai ≤ 10^9   Example Input: 3 4 1 2 3 4 4 1 -5 1 -5 6 -5 -1 -1 2 -2 -3  Output: 1 1 1 1 4 3 2 1 1 1 3 2 1 1  Explanation Example case 1. No two elements have different signs, so any alternating subarray may only consist of a single number. Example case 2. Every subarray is alternating. Example case 3. The only alternating subarray of length 3 is A3..5. 
Kattapa, as you all know was one of the greatest warriors of his time. The kingdom of Maahishmati had never lost a battle under him (as army-chief), and the reason for that was their really powerful army, also called as Mahasena. Kattapa was known to be a very superstitious person. He believed that a soldier is "lucky" if the soldier is holding an even number of weapons, and "unlucky" otherwise. He considered the army as "READY FOR BATTLE" if the count of "lucky" soldiers is strictly greater than the count of "unlucky" soldiers, and "NOT READY" otherwise. Given the number of weapons each soldier is holding, your task is to determine whether the army formed by all these soldiers is "READY FOR BATTLE" or "NOT READY". Note: You can find the definition of an even number here.  Input  The first line of input consists of a single integer N denoting the number of soldiers. The second line of input consists of N space separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN, where Ai denotes the number of weapons that the i^th soldier is holding.  Output Generate one line output saying "READY FOR BATTLE", if the army satisfies the conditions that Kattapa requires or "NOT READY" otherwise (quotes for clarity).  Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 100 1 ≤ Ai ≤ 100   Example 1 Input: 1 1  Output: NOT READY  Example 2 Input: 1 2  Output: READY FOR BATTLE  Example 3 Input: 4 11 12 13 14  Output: NOT READY  Example 4 Input: 3 2 3 4  Output: READY FOR BATTLE  Example 5 Input: 5 1 2 3 4 5  Output: NOT READY  Explanation   Example 1: For the first example, N = 1 and the array A = [1]. There is only 1 soldier and he is holding 1 weapon, which is odd. The number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons = 0, and number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons = 1. Hence, the answer is "NOT READY" since the number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons is not greater than the number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons. Example 2: For the second example, N = 1 and the array A = [2]. There is only 1 soldier and he is holding 2 weapons, which is even. The number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons = 1, and number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons = 0. Hence, the answer is "READY FOR BATTLE" since the number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons is greater than the number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons. Example 3: For the third example, N = 4 and the array A = [11, 12, 13, 14]. The 1^st soldier is holding 11 weapons (which is odd), the 2^nd soldier is holding 12 weapons (which is even), the 3^rd soldier is holding 13 weapons (which is odd), and the 4^th soldier is holding 14 weapons (which is even). The number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons = 2, and number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons = 2. Notice that we have an equal number of people holding even number of weapons and odd number of weapons. The answer here is "NOT READY" since the number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons is not strictly greater than the number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons. Example 4: For the fourth example, N = 3 and the array A = [2, 3, 4]. The 1^st soldier is holding 2 weapons (which is even), the 2^nd soldier is holding 3 weapons (which is odd), and the 3^rd soldier is holding 4 weapons (which is even). The number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons = 2, and number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons = 1. Hence, the answer is "READY FOR BATTLE" since the number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons is greater than the number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons. Example 5: For the fifth example, N = 5 and the array A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The 1^st soldier is holding 1 weapon (which is odd), the 2^nd soldier is holding 2 weapons (which is even), the 3^rd soldier is holding 3 weapons (which is odd), the 4^th soldier is holding 4 weapons (which is even), and the 5^th soldier is holding 5 weapons (which is odd). The number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons = 2, and number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons = 3. Hence, the answer is "NOT READY" since the number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons is not greater than the number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons.  
 	A valid parentheses sequence is a non-empty string where each character is either '(' or ')', which satisfies the following constraint:   You can find a way to repeat erasing adjacent pairs of parentheses '()' until it becomes empty.   	For example, '(())' and '()((()()))' are valid parentheses sequences, but ')()(' and '(()' are not.   	Mike has a valid parentheses sequence. He really likes everything about his sequence, except the fact that it is quite long. So Mike has recently decided that he will replace his parentheses sequence with a new one in the near future. But not every valid parentheses sequence will satisfy him. To help you understand his requirements we'll introduce the pseudocode of function F(S):   	FUNCTION F( S - a valid parentheses sequence ) 	BEGIN 		balance = 0 		max_balance = 0 		FOR index FROM 1 TO LENGTH(S) 		BEGIN 			if S[index] == '(' then balance = balance + 1 			if S[index] == ')' then balance = balance - 1 			max_balance = max( max_balance, balance ) 		END 		RETURN max_balance 	END  	In other words, F(S) is equal to the maximal balance over all prefixes of S.   	Let's denote A as Mike's current parentheses sequence, and B as a candidate for a new one. Mike is willing to replace A with B if F(A) is equal to F(B). He would also like to choose B with the minimal possible length amongst ones satisfying the previous condition. If there are several such strings with the minimal possible length, then Mike will choose the least one lexicographically, considering '(' to be less than ')'.   	Help Mike!   Input  	The first line of the input contains one integer T denoting the number of testcases to process.   	The only line of each testcase contains one string A denoting Mike's parentheses sequence. It is guaranteed that A only consists of the characters '(' and ')'. It is also guaranteed that A is a valid parentheses sequence.   Output  	The output should contain exactly T lines, one line per each testcase in the order of their appearance. The only line of each testcase should contain one string B denoting the valid parentheses sequence that should be chosen by Mike to replace A.   Constraints 1 ≤ T ≤ 5; 1 ≤ |A| ≤ 100000(10^5).  Example Input: 1 ()((()()))  Output: ((()))  
 Chef likes problems involving arrays. Unfortunately, the last one he tried to solve didn't quite get solved.   Chef has an array A of N positive numbers. He wants to find the number of subarrays for which the sum and product of elements are equal.   Please help Chef find this number.   Input The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The first line of each test contains the integer N. The next line contains N integers — A1, A2, ..., AN — denoting the array.  Output For each test case, output a single line with the answer for the instance.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 50 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 1 ≤ Ai ≤ 10^9^ A1 * A2 * ... * An ≤ 10^9^   Example  Input: 3 3 1 3 2 4 4 1 2 1 6 1 2 2 2 2 1  Output: 4 5 9  Explanation:  Example case 1. There are 4 such subarrays: A[1..1], A[2..2], A[3..3], A[1..3]. Consider A[1..3], sum = 1 + 3 + 2 = 6, product = 1 * 3 * 2 = 6.  
  Chef has a sequence of N numbers. He like a sequence better if the sequence contains his favorite sequence as a substring.   Given the sequence and his favorite sequence(F) check whether the favorite sequence is contained in the sequence  Input  The first line will contain the number of test cases and are followed by the cases. Each test case consists of four lines: The length of the sequence, the sequence N,the length of F and the sequence F   Output  Print "Yes" if the sequence contains the favourite sequence int it otherwise print "No"   Constraints  1<=T<=10 1 1  Input: 2 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 3 2 3 4 6 22 5 6 33 1 4 2 4 15  Output: Yes No 
Chef has found two very old sheets of paper, each of which originally contained a string of lowercase Latin letters. The strings on both the sheets have equal lengths. However, since the sheets are very old, some letters have become unreadable. Chef would like to estimate the difference between these strings. Let's assume that the first string is named S1, and the second S2. The unreadable symbols are specified with the question mark symbol '?'. The difference between the strings equals to the number of positions i, such that S1i is not equal to S2i, where S1i and S2i denote the symbol at the i the position in S1 and S2, respectively. Chef would like to know the minimal and the maximal difference between the two strings, if he changes all unreadable symbols to lowercase Latin letters. Now that you're fully aware of Chef's programming expertise, you might have guessed that he needs you help solving this problem as well. Go on, help him!  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of a test case contains a string S1. The second line of a test case contains a string S2. Both strings consist of lowercase Latin letters and question marks in places where the symbols are unreadable.  Output For each test case, output the minimal and the maximal difference between two given strings separated with a single space.  Constraints   1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ |S1|, |S2| ≤ 100 Example Input: 3 a?c ??b ???a ???a ?abac aba?w  Output: 1 3 0 3 3 5  Explanation Example case 1. You can change the question marks in the strings so that you obtain S1 = abc and S2 = abb. Then S1 and S2 will differ in one position. On the other hand, you can change the letters so that S1 = abc and S2 = bab. Then, the strings will differ in all three positions. Example case 2. Change the question marks this way: S1 = dcba, S2 = dcba, then the strings will differ in 0 positions. You can also change the question marks so that S1 = aaaa, S2 = dcba, then the strings will differ in 3 positions. Example case 3. Change the question marks this way: S1 = aabac, S2 = abaaw, then the strings will differ in 3 positions. Then, change the question marks this way: S1 = xabac, S2 = abayw, then they will differ in 5 positions. 
Little Malvika is very peculiar about colors. On her birthday, her mom wanted to buy balloons for decorating the house. So she asked her about her color preferences. The sophisticated little person that Malvika is, she likes only two colors — amber and brass. Her mom bought n balloons, each of which was either amber or brass in color. You are provided this information in a string s consisting of characters 'a' and 'b' only, where 'a' denotes that the balloon is amber, where 'b' denotes it being brass colored.   When Malvika saw the balloons, she was furious with anger as she wanted all the balloons of the same color. In her anger, she painted some of the balloons with the opposite color (i.e., she painted some amber ones brass and vice versa) to make all balloons appear to be the same color. As she was very angry, it took her a lot of time to do this, but you can probably show her the right way of doing so, thereby teaching her a lesson to remain calm in difficult situations, by finding out the minimum number of balloons needed to be painted in order to make all of them the same color.   Input  The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The first and only line of each test case contains a string s.   Output  For each test case, output a single line containing an integer — the minimum number of flips required.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, where n denotes to the length of the string s.   Example Input: 3 ab bb baaba  Output: 1 0 2  Explanation In the first example, you can change amber to brass or brass to amber. In both the cases, both the balloons will have same colors. So, you will need to paint 1 balloon. So the answer is 1.  In the second example, As the color of all the balloons is already the same, you don't need to paint any of them. So, the answer is 0.  
Chef has just started Programming, he is in first year of Engineering. Chef is reading about Relational Operators. Relational Operators are operators which check relatioship between two values. Given two numerical values A and B you need to help chef in finding the relationship between them that is, First one is greater than second or, First one is less than second or, First and second one are equal.    Input First line contains an integer T, which denotes the number of testcases.

After visiting a childhood friend, Chef wants to get back to his home. Friend lives at the first street, and Chef himself lives at the N-th (and the last) street. Their city is a bit special: you can move from the X-th street to the Y-th street if and only if 1 <= Y - X <= K, where K is the integer value that is given to you. Chef wants to get to home in such a way that the product of all the visited streets' special numbers is minimal (including the first and the N-th street). Please, help him to find such a product.  Input The first line of input consists of two integer numbers - N and K - the number of streets and the value of K respectively. The second line consist of N numbers  - A1, A2, ..., AN respectively, where Ai equals to the special number of the i-th street.  Output Please output the value of the minimal possible product, modulo 1000000007.  Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ Ai ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ K ≤ N   Example Input: 4 2 1 2 3 4.

 Tomya is a girl. She loves Chef Ciel very much.   Tomya like a positive integer p, and now she wants to get a receipt of Ciel's restaurant whose total price is exactly p. The current menus of Ciel's restaurant are shown the following table.   Name of Menuprice eel flavored water1 deep-fried eel bones2 clear soup made with eel livers4 grilled eel livers served with grated radish8 savory egg custard with eel16 eel fried rice (S)32 eel fried rice (L)64 grilled eel wrapped in cooked egg128 eel curry rice256 grilled eel over rice512 deluxe grilled eel over rice1024 eel full-course2048   Note that the i-th menu has the price 2^i-1 (1 ≤ i ≤ 12).   Since Tomya is a pretty girl, she cannot eat a lot. So please find the minimum number of menus whose total price is exactly p. Note that if she orders the same menu twice, then it is considered as two menus are ordered. (See Explanations for details)   Input  The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains an integer p.   Output  For each test case, print the minimum number of menus whose total price is exactly p.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 5 1 ≤ p ≤ 100000 (10^5) There exists combinations of menus whose total price is exactly p.   Sample Input 4 10 256 255 4096  Sample Output 2 1 8 2  Explanations  In the first sample, examples of the menus whose total price is 10 are the following: 1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1 = 10 (10 menus) 1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+2 = 10 (9 menus) 2+2+2+2+2 = 10 (5 menus) 2+4+4 = 10 (3 menus) 2+8 = 10 (2 menus) Here the minimum number of menus is 2.   In the last sample, the optimal way is 2048+2048=4096 (2 menus). Note that there is no menu whose price is 4096. 
After a long time, Chef has finally decided to renovate his house. Chef's house has N rooms in it numbered from 1 to N. Each room is currently painted in one of the red, blue or green colors. Your are given configuration of colors of his house by a string S consisting of N characters. In this string, color red will be denoted by 'R', green by 'G' and blue by 'B'.   Chef does not like current painting configuration that much and would like to repaint the house such that each room has same color. For painting, Chef has all the 3 color paints available and mixing any 2 color paints will result into 3rd color paint i.e  R + B = G B + G = R G + R = B   For example, painting a room having red color before with green color paint will make the color of room blue.   Also, Chef has many buckets of paint of each color. Simply put, you can assume that he will not run out of paint.  Being extraordinary lazy, our little chef does not want to work much and therefore, he has asked you to find the minimum number of rooms he has to repaint (possibly zero) in order to have all the rooms with same color. Can you please help him?  Input First line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. First line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the number of rooms in the chef's house. Next line of each test case contains a string S denoting the current color configuration of rooms.  Output For each test case, Print the minimum number of rooms need to be painted in order to have all the rooms painted with same color i.e either red, blue or green.  Constraints   1 ≤ T ≤ 10   1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5   Si = {'R','G','B'}    Scoring  Example Input  3 3 RGR 3 RRR 3 RGB  Output  1 0 2  Explanation:  Test 1: Chef prefers to paint room 2 with blue color such that the resulting color will be red and all the rooms have same color i.e red. Test 2: Given configuration has all the rooms painted with red color and therefore, chef does not need to do painting work at all. Test 3: One possible way of renovation is to paint room 1 with green color, room 2 with red color such that all rooms have same color i.e blue.  
 The Chef likes to stay in touch with his staff. So, the Chef, the head server, and the sous-chef all carry two-way transceivers so they can stay in constant contact. Of course, these transceivers have a limited range so if two are too far apart, they cannot communicate directly.   The Chef invested in top-of-the-line transceivers which have a few advanced features. One is that even if two people cannot talk directly because they are out of range, if there is another transceiver that is close enough to both, then the two transceivers can still communicate with each other using the third transceiver as an intermediate device.   There has been a minor emergency in the Chef's restaurant and he needs to communicate with both the head server and the sous-chef right away. Help the Chef determine if it is possible for all three people to communicate with each other, even if two must communicate through the third because they are too far apart.   Input  The first line contains a single positive integer T ≤ 100 indicating the number of test cases to follow. The first line of each test case contains a positive integer R ≤ 1,000 indicating that two transceivers can communicate directly without an intermediate transceiver if they are at most R meters away from each other. The remaining three lines of the test case describe the current locations of the Chef, the head server, and the sous-chef, respectively. Each such line contains two integers X,Y (at most 10,000 in absolute value) indicating that the respective person is located at position X,Y.   Output  For each test case you are to output a single line containing a single string. If it is possible for all three to communicate then you should output "yes". Otherwise, you should output "no".   To be clear, we say that two transceivers are close enough to communicate directly if the length of the straight line connecting their X,Y coordinates is at most R.   Example  Input: 3 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 2 0 1 0 0 1 0 2 0 0 0 2 2 1   Output: yes yes no  
Chef is on a vacation these days, so his friend Chefza is trying to solve Chef's everyday tasks. Today's task is to make a sweet roll. Rolls are made by a newly invented cooking machine. The machine is pretty universal - it can make lots of dishes and Chefza is thrilled about this. To make a roll, Chefza has to set all the settings to specified integer values. There are lots of settings, each of them set to some initial value. The machine is pretty complex and there is a lot of cooking to be done today, so Chefza has decided to use only two quick ways to change the settings. In a unit of time, he can pick one setting (let's say its current value is v) and change it in one of the following ways.  If v is even, change this setting to v/2. If v is odd, change it to (v − 1)/2. Change setting to 2 × v  The receipt is given as a list of integer values the settings should be set to. It is guaranteed that each destination setting can be represented as an integer power of 2. Since Chefza has just changed his profession, he has a lot of other things to do. Please help him find the minimum number of operations needed to set up a particular setting of the machine. You can prove that it can be done in finite time.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains two integers A and B denoting the initial and desired values of the setting, respectively.  Output For each test case, output a single line containing minimum number of operations Chefza has to perform in order to set up the machine.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 200 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^7 1 ≤ B ≤ 10^7, and B is an integer power of 2   Example Input: 6 1 1 2 4 3 8 4 16 4 1 1 4  Output: 0 1 4 2 2 2  Explanation  In the first test case, you don't need to do anything. In the second test case, you need to multiply 2 by 2 and get 4. This is done in 1 operation. In the third test case, you need to obtain 1 from 3 and then multiply it by 2 three times to obtain 8. A total of 4 operations. In the fourth test case, multiply 4 by 2 twice. In the fifth test case, divide 4 by 2 twice. In the sixth test case, multiply 1 by 2 twice.  
There are 100 houses located on a straight line. The first house is numbered 1 and the last one is numbered 100. Some M houses out of these 100 are occupied by cops. Thief Devu has just stolen PeePee's bag and is looking for a house to hide in. PeePee uses fast 4G Internet and sends the message to all the cops that a thief named Devu has just stolen her bag and ran into some house. Devu knows that the cops run at a maximum speed of x houses per minute in a straight line and they will search for a maximum of y minutes. Devu wants to know how many houses are safe for him to escape from the cops. Help him in getting this information.  Input First line contains T, the number of test cases to follow. First line of each test case contains 3 space separated integers: M, x and y. For each test case, the second line contains M space separated integers which represent the house numbers where the cops are residing.  Output For each test case, output a single line containing the number of houses which are safe to hide from cops.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4 1 ≤ x, y, M ≤ 10   Example Input: 3 4 7 8 12 52 56 8 2 10 2 21 75 2 5 8 10 51  Output: 0 18 9  Explanation Example 1 : Cops in house 12 can cover houses 1 to 68, and cops in house 52 can cover the rest of the houses. So, there is no safe house. Example 2 : Cops in house 21 can cover houses 1 to 41, and cops in house 75 can cover houses 55 to 95, leaving houses numbered 42 to 54, and 96 to 100 safe. So, in total 18 houses are safe. 
 Grapes of Coderpur are very famous. Devu went to the market and saw that there were N people selling grapes. He didn’t like it because things were not very structured. So, he gave a task to Dhinwa to make things better. If Dhinwa successfully completes the task, Devu will be happy.   Devu wants to change the number of grapes in a bucket of zero or more sellers in such a way that the GCD  of all the number of grapes is divisible by K. Dhinwa can add or remove any number of grapes from each of the buckets. Adding or removing a grape will be counted as an operation. Also after the operation, none of the seller’s bucket should be empty.   Help Dhinwa in finding the minimum number of operations needed to make Devu happy.   Input  First line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. For each test case, first line will contain an integer N denoting the number of buckets and integer K.  Next line contains N space separated integers denoting the number of grapes in each of the bucket.   Output For each test case, print a single integer representing the answer of that test case.  Constraints  Example Input: 2 2 2 3 5 3 7 10 16 18  Output: 2 8   Explanation  For the first test case, add or remove 1 grape in each of the bucket.   For the second test case, remove three grapes in the first bucket, remove two grapes from the second bucket and add three grapes in the third bucket.  
The faculty of application management and consulting services (FAMCS) of the Berland State University (BSU) has always been popular among Berland's enrollees. This year, N students attended the entrance exams, but no more than K will enter the university. In order to decide who are these students, there are series of entrance exams. All the students with score strictly greater than at least (N-K) students' total score gets enrolled. In total there are E entrance exams, in each of them one can score between 0 and M points, inclusively. The first E-1 exams had already been conducted, and now it's time for the last tribulation. Sergey is the student who wants very hard to enter the university, so he had collected the information about the first E-1 from all N-1 enrollees (i.e., everyone except him). Of course, he knows his own scores as well. In order to estimate his chances to enter the University after the last exam, Sergey went to a fortune teller. From the visit, he learnt about scores that everyone except him will get at the last exam. Now he wants to calculate the minimum score he needs to score in order to enter to the university. But now he's still very busy with minimizing the amount of change he gets in the shops, so he asks you to help him.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains four space separated integers N, K, E, M denoting the number of students, the maximal number of students who'll get enrolled, the total number of entrance exams and maximal number of points for a single exam, respectively. The following N-1 lines will contain E integers each, where the first E-1 integers correspond to the scores of the exams conducted. The last integer corresponds to the score at the last exam, that was predicted by the fortune-teller. The last line contains E-1 integers denoting Sergey's score for the first E-1 exams.  Output  For each test case, output a single line containing the minimum score Sergey should get in the last exam in order to be enrolled. If Sergey doesn't have a chance to be enrolled, output "Impossible" (without quotes).   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 5 1 ≤ K < N ≤ 10^4 1 ≤ M ≤ 10^9 1 ≤ E ≤ 4   Example Input: 1 4 2 3 10 7 7 7 4 6 10 7 10 9 9 9  Output: 4  Explanation Example case 1. If Sergey gets 4 points at the last exam, his score will be equal to 9+9+4=22. This will be the second score among all the enrollees - the first one will get 21, the second one will get 20 and the third will have the total of 26. Thus, Sergey will enter the university. 
 The most important part of a GSM network is so called Base Transceiver Station (BTS). These transceivers form the areas called cells (this term gave the name to the cellular phone) and every phone connects to the BTS with the strongest signal (in a little simplified view). Of course, BTSes need some attention and technicians need to check their function periodically.  The technicians faced a very interesting problem recently. Given a set of BTSes to visit, they needed to find the shortest path to visit all of the given points and return back to the central company building. Programmers have spent several months studying this problem but with no results. They were unable to find the solution fast enough. After a long time, one of the programmers found this problem in a conference article. Unfortunately, he found that the problem is so called "Traveling Salesman Problem" and it is very hard to solve. If we have N BTSes to be visited, we can visit them in any order, giving us N! possibilities to examine. The function expressing that number is called factorial and can be computed as a product  1.2.3.4....N. The number is very high even for a relatively small N. The programmers understood they had no chance to solve the problem. But because they have already received the research grant from the government, they needed to continue with their studies and produce at least some results. So they started to study behavior of the factorial function. For example, they defined the function Z. For any positive integer N, Z(N) is the number of zeros at the end of the decimal form of number N!. They noticed that this function never decreases. If we have two numbers N1<N2, then  Z(N1) <= Z(N2). It is because we can never "lose" any trailing zero by multiplying by any positive number. We can only get new and new zeros. The function Z is very interesting, so we need a computer program that can determine its value efficiently.  Input There is a single positive integer T on the first line of input (equal to about 100000). It stands for the number of numbers to follow. Then there are T lines, each containing exactly one positive integer number N, 1 <= N <= 1000000000.  Output For every number N, output a single line containing the single non-negative integer Z(N).  Example Sample Input:  6 3 60 100 1024 23456 8735373  Sample Output:  0 14 24 253 5861 2183837

  Forgotten languages (also known as extinct languages) are languages that are no longer in use. Such languages were, probably, widely used before and no one could have ever imagined that they will become extinct at some point. Unfortunately, that is what happened to them. On the happy side of things, a language may be dead, but some of its words may continue to be used in other languages.   Using something called as the Internet, you have acquired a dictionary of N words of a forgotten language. Meanwhile, you also know K phrases used in modern languages. For each of the words of the forgotten language, your task is to determine whether the word is still in use in any of these K modern phrases or not.   Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.   The first line of a test case description contains two space separated positive integers N and K.   The second line of the description contains N strings denoting a dictionary of the forgotten language.   Each of the next K lines of the description starts with one positive integer L denoting the number of words in the corresponding phrase in modern languages. The integer is followed by L strings (not necessarily distinct) denoting the phrase.   Output For each test case, output a single line containing N tokens (space-separated): if the i^th word of the dictionary exists in at least one phrase in modern languages, then you should output YES as the i^th token, otherwise NO.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 20 1 ≤ N ≤ 100 1 ≤ K, L ≤ 50 1 ≤ length of any string in the input ≤ 5   Example Input: 2 3 2 piygu ezyfo rzotm 1 piygu 6 tefwz tefwz piygu ezyfo tefwz piygu 4 1 kssdy tjzhy ljzym kegqz 4 kegqz kegqz kegqz vxvyj  Output: YES YES NO NO NO NO YES  
Today is Chef's birthday. His mom has surprised him with truly fruity gifts: 2 fruit baskets. The first basket contains N apples, and the second one contains M oranges. Chef likes apples and oranges very much but he likes them equally, and therefore, wants to have the minimum possible difference between the number of apples and oranges he has. To do so, he can purchase 1 apple or 1 orange by paying exactly 1 gold coin (that's some expensive fruit, eh?). Chef can purchase fruits at most K times (as he has only K gold coins in his pocket) to make the difference the minimum possible. Our little Chef is busy in celebrating his birthday to the fullest, and therefore, he has handed this job to his best friend — you. Can you help him by finding the minimum possible difference he can achieve between the number of apples and orange he owns?  Input The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The first and only line of each test case contains 3 space separated integers — N, M and K — denoting the number of apples, number of oranges, and number of gold coins our little Chef has.  Output For each test case, output the minimum possible difference between the number of apples and oranges that Chef can achieve.  Constraints   1 ≤ T ≤ 100   1 ≤ N, M, K ≤ 100    Example Input  3 3 4 1 5 2 1 3 4 3  Output 0 2 0  Explanation  Test 1: Chef will buy 1 apple by paying 1 gold coin and will have equal number of apples and oranges. Test 2: Chef will buy 1 orange by paying 1 gold coin and will have 5 apples and 3 oranges.  
  In olden days finding square roots seemed to be difficult but nowadays it can be easily done using in-built functions available across many languages .  Assume that you happen to hear the above words and you want to give a try in finding the square root of any given integer using in-built functions. So here's your chance.

Tuzik is a little dog. But despite the fact he is still a puppy he already knows about the pretty things that coins are. He knows that for every coin he can get very tasty bone from his master. He believes that some day he will find a treasure and have loads of bones. And finally he found something interesting. A wooden chest containing N coins! But as you should remember, Tuzik is just a little dog, and so he can't open it by himself. Actually, the only thing he can really do is barking. He can use his barking to attract nearby people and seek their help. He can set the loudness of his barking very precisely, and therefore you can assume that he can choose to call any number of people, from a minimum of 1, to a maximum of K. When people come and open the chest they divide all the coins between them in such a way that everyone will get the same amount of coins and this amount is maximal possible. If some coins are not used they will leave it on the ground and Tuzik will take them after they go away. Since Tuzik is clearly not a fool, he understands that his profit depends on the number of people he will call. While Tuzik works on his barking, you have to find the maximum possible number of coins he can get.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each of next T lines contains 2 space-separated integers: N and K, for this test case.  Output For each test case output one integer - the maximum possible number of coins Tuzik can get.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 50 1 ≤ N, K ≤ 10^5   Example Input: 2 5 2 11 3  Output: 1 2  Explanation In the first example he should call two people. Each of them will take 2 coins and they will leave 1 coin for Tuzik. In the second example he should call 3 people.  
Tanu has got interested in signs and gestures that we use for communication. One such gesture is the head-bob.When we want to signal "Yes" to someone, we move the head up-and-down. For "No", the head is moved left-and-right, rotating about the vertical axis. There is a peculiar way of gesturing "Yes", commonly seen in India, by moving head sideways (rotating about the forward-back axis). This is called the  Indian head-bob. Tanu observed many people on the railways station, and made a list of gestures that they made. Usual "Yes" gesture is recorded as "Y", no as "N" and Indian "Yes" gesture as "I". (Assume no foreigner uses the Indian "Yes" gesture and vice-versa). Identify which of them were Indians, which were not Indian, and which one you cannot be sure about.  Input First line contains T, number of people observed by Tanu.Each person is described in two lines. First line of the description contains a single integer N, the number of gestures recorded for this person. Next line contains a string of N characters, each character can be "Y", "N" or "I".  Output For each person, print "INDIAN" if he/she is from India, "NOT INDIAN" if not from India, and "NOT SURE" if the information is insufficient to make a decision.  Constraints  For 30 points: 1 ≤ T,N ≤ 100For 70 points: 1 ≤ T,N ≤ 1000 Example Input: 35NNNYY6NNINNI4NNNNOutput: NOT INDIANINDIANNOT SURE

There are N students living in the dormitory of Berland State University. Each of them sometimes wants to use the kitchen, so the head of the dormitory came up with a timetable for kitchen's usage in order to avoid the conflicts:  The first student starts to use the kitchen at the time 0 and should finish the cooking not later than at the time A1. The second student starts to use the kitchen at the time A1 and should finish the cooking not later than at the time A2. And so on. The N-th student starts to use the kitchen at the time AN-1 and should finish the cooking not later than at the time AN  The holidays in Berland are approaching, so today each of these N students wants to cook some pancakes. The i-th student needs Bi units of time to cook. The students have understood that probably not all of them will be able to cook everything they want. How many students will be able to cook without violating the schedule?  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of students. The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the moments of time by when the corresponding student should finish cooking. The third line contains N space-separated integers B1, B2, ..., BN denoting the time required for each of the students to cook.  Output For each test case, output a single line containing the number of students that will be able to finish the cooking.  Constraints Should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have. Format it like:  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^4 0 < A1 <  A2 < ... < AN < 10^9 1 ≤ Bi ≤ 10^9   Example Input: 2 3 1 10 15 1 10 3 3 10 20 30 15 5 20  Output: 2 1  Explanation Example case 1. The first student has 1 unit of time - the moment 0. It will be enough for her to cook. The second student has 9 units of time, but wants to cook for 10 units of time, and won't fit in time. The third student has 5 units of time and will fit in time, because needs to cook only for 3 units of time. Example case 2. Each of students has 10 units of time, but only the second one will be able to fit in time. 
 You might have heard about our new goodie distribution program aka the "Laddu Accrual System". This problem is designed to give you a glimpse of its rules. You can read the page once before attempting the problem if you wish, nonetheless we will be providing all the information needed here itself.   Laddu Accrual System is our new goodie distribution program. In this program, we will be distributing Laddus in place of goodies for your winnings and various other activities (described below), that you perform on our system. Once you collect enough number of Laddus, you can then redeem them to get yourself anything from a wide range of CodeChef goodies.   Let us know about various activities and amount of laddus you get corresponding to them.  Contest Win (CodeChef’s Long, Cook-Off, LTIME, or any contest hosted with us) : 300 + Bonus (Bonus = 20 - contest rank). Note that if your rank is > 20, then you won't get any bonus. Top Contributor on Discuss : 300 Bug Finder	: 50 - 1000 (depending on the bug severity). It may also fetch you a CodeChef internship! Contest Hosting	 : 50   You can do a checkout for redeeming laddus once a month. The minimum laddus redeemable at Check Out are 200 for Indians and 400 for the rest of the world.   You are given history of various activities of a user. The user has not redeemed any of the its laddus accrued.. Now the user just wants to redeem as less amount of laddus he/she can, so that the laddus can last for as long as possible. Find out for how many maximum number of months he can redeem the laddus.   Input  The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting number of test cases For each test case:  First line contains an integer followed by a string denoting activities, origin respectively, where activities denotes number of activities of the user, origin denotes whether the user is Indian or the rest of the world. origin can be "INDIAN" or "NON_INDIAN". For each of the next activities lines, each line contains an activity. 			An activity can be of four types as defined above.  Contest Win : Input will be of form of CONTEST_WON rank, where rank denotes the rank of the user. Top Contributor : Input will be of form of TOP_CONTRIBUTOR. Bug Finder : Input will be of form of BUG_FOUND severity, where severity denotes the severity of the bug. Contest Hosting : Input will be of form of CONTEST_HOSTED.       Output  For each test case, find out the maximum number of months for which the user can redeem the laddus accrued.   Constraints  1 ≤ T, activities ≤ 100 1 ≤ rank ≤ 5000 50 ≤ severity ≤ 1000   Example Input: 2 4 INDIAN CONTEST_WON 1 TOP_CONTRIBUTOR BUG_FOUND 100 CONTEST_HOSTED 4 NON_INDIAN CONTEST_WON 1 TOP_CONTRIBUTOR BUG_FOUND 100 CONTEST_HOSTED  Output: 3 1  Explanation In the first example,  For winning contest with rank 1, user gets 300 + 20 - 1 = 319 laddus. For top contributor, user gets 300 laddus. For finding a bug with severity of 100, user gets 100 laddus. For hosting a contest, user gets 50 laddus.   So, overall user gets 319 + 300 + 100 + 50 = 769 laddus. Now, the user is an Indian user, he can redeem only 200 laddus per month. So, for first three months, he will redeem 200 * 3 = 600 laddus. The remaining 169 laddus, he can not redeem as he requires at least 200 laddues in a month to redeem. So, answer is 3.  In the second example, user is a non-Indian user, he can redeem 400 laddues per month. So, in the first month, he will redeem 400 laddus. The remaining 369 laddus, he can not redeem as he requires at least 400 laddues in a month to redeem. So, answer is 1.

Note that it is not necessary that if a boy x likes girl y, then girl y should like boy x. You know that if there are two different boys x and y, who both like girl z, then there will be a collision. Can you calculate the number of different collisions at this party? Note that order of boys in the collision doesn't matter.  Input The first line contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers N, M denoting the number of boys and girls, respectively. Each of the following N lines contain M characters, each of them is either '0' or '1'.  Output For each test case output a single line containing an integer corresponding to the number of collisions at the party.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ N, M ≤ 10   Example Input: 2 4 3 111 100 110 000 2 2 10 01  Output: 4 0   Explanation Example Case 1. All three boys like the first girl, so there are (1, 2, 1), (1, 3, 1), (2, 3, 1) collisions with her. Boys 1 and 3 both like the second girl so this is one more collision. Only one boy likes the third girl, so there are no collisions with her and thus we have 4 collisions total. Example Case 2. For each girl there is only one boy who likes her, so there are no collisions at all.

 You have a matrix of size N * N with rows numbered through 1 to N from top to bottom and columns through 1 to N from left to right. It contains all values from 1 to N^2, i.e. each value from 1 to N^2 occurs exactly once in the matrix.   Now, you start from the cell containing value 1, and from there visit the cell with value 2, and then from there visit the cell with value 3, and so on till you have visited cell containing the number N^2. In a single step, you can move from a cell to one of its adjacent cells. Two cells are said to be adjacent to each other if they share an edge between them.

Leha is playing a very interesting game. The game will be played on a rectangular grid consisting of N rows and M columns. Initially all the cells of the grid are uncolored. Leha's initial score is zero. At each turn, he chooses some cell that is yet not colored, and colors that cell. The score obtained in this step will be number of neighboring colored cells of the cell that Leha colored in this step. Two cells are neighbors of each other if they share a side between them. The game will end when all the cells are colored. Finally, total score obtained at the end of the game will sum of score obtained in each turn. Leha wants to know what maximum score he can get? Can you please help him in finding this out?  Input The first line contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. T test cases follow. Each of the following T lines contains two space-separated integers N, M denoting the dimensions of the grid.  Output For each test case, output a single line containing an integer corresponding to the maximal possible score Leha can obtain.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ N, M ≤ 1 000   Example Input: 1 2 2  Output: 4  Explanation Leha can obtain total score 4 in the following way.  In the first step, he colors down left cell, all the neighboring cells of this cell are uncolored. So, it adds 0 to total score. In second step, he can color upper right cell, it also adds total 0 to the score. In third step, he can color top left cell. There are two neighboring cell of this cell, both of which are colored. So, this add 2 to the score. In the last step, he can choose the remaining down right cell. There are two neighboring cell of this cell, both of which are colored. So, this also add 2 to the score.   Leha can't obtain a score more than 4. Hence 4 is the answer.  
 Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) is a mathematical notation where every operator follows all of its operands. For instance, to add three and four, one would write "3 4 +" rather than "3 + 4". If there are multiple operations, the operator is given immediately after its second operand; so the expression written "3 − 4 + 5" would be written "3 4 − 5 +" first subtract 4 from 3, then add 5 to that.   Transform the algebraic expression with brackets into RPN form.   You can assume that for the test cases below only single letters will be used, brackets [] will not be used and each expression has only one RPN form (no expressions like a*b*c)    Input  The first line contains t, the number of test cases (less then 100).   Followed by t lines, containing an expression to be translated to RPN form, where the length of the expression is less then 400.   Output  The expressions in RPN form, one per line.   Example  Input: 3 (a+(b*c)) ((a+b)*(z+x)) ((a+t)*((b+(a+c))^(c+d)))  Output: abc*+ ab+zx+* at+bac++cd+^* 
  The citizens of Byteland regularly play a game. They have blocks each denoting some integer from 0 to 9. These are arranged together in a random manner without seeing to form different numbers keeping in mind that the first block is never a 0. Once they form a number they read in the reverse order to check if the number and its reverse is the same. If both are same then the player wins. We call such numbers palindrome Ash happens to see this game and wants to simulate the same in the computer. As the first step he wants to take an input from the user and check if the number is palindrome and declare if the user wins or not   Input  The first line of the input contains T, the number of test cases. This is followed by T lines containing an integer N.   Output  For each input output "wins" if the number is a palindrome and "losses" if not.

 Some programming contest problems are really tricky: not only do they require a different output format from what you might have expected, but also the sample output does not show the difference. For an example, let us look at permutations. A permutation of the integers 1 to n is an ordering of these integers. So the natural way to represent a permutation is to list the integers in this order. With n = 5, a permutation might look like 2, 3, 4, 5, 1. However, there is another possibility of representing a permutation: You create a list of numbers where the i-th number is the position of the integer i in the permutation. Let us call this second possibility an inverse permutation. The inverse permutation for the sequence above is 5, 1, 2, 3, 4.  An ambiguous permutation is a permutation which cannot be distinguished from its inverse permutation. The permutation 1, 4, 3, 2 for example is ambiguous, because its inverse permutation is the same. To get rid of such annoying sample test cases, you have to write a program which detects if a given permutation is ambiguous or not.   Input Specification The input contains several test cases. The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000). Then a permutation of the integers 1 to n follows in the next line. There is exactly one space character between consecutive integers. You can assume that every integer between 1 and n appears exactly once in the permutation.  The last test case is followed by a zero.   Output Specification For each test case output whether the permutation is ambiguous or not. Adhere to the format shown in the sample output.   Sample Input 4 1 4 3 2 5 2 3 4 5 1 1 1 0   Sample Output ambiguous not ambiguous ambiguous

Princess Rupsa saw one of her friends playing a special game. The game goes as follows:  N+1 numbers occur sequentially (one at a time) from A0 to AN. You must write the numbers on a sheet of paper, such that A0 is written first. The other numbers are written according to an inductive rule — after Ai-1 numbers have been written in a row, then Ai can be written at either end of the row. That is, you first write A0, and then A1 can be written on its left or right to make A0A1 or A1A0, and so on. Ai must be written before writing Aj, for every i < j. For a move in which you write a number Ai (i>0), your points increase by the product of Ai and its neighbour. (Note that for any move it will have only one neighbour as you write the number at an end). Total score of a game is the score you attain after placing all the N + 1 numbers.  Princess Rupsa wants to find out the sum of scores obtained by all possible different gameplays. Two gameplays are different, if after writing down all N + 1 numbers, when we read from left to right, there exists some position i, at which the gameplays have aj and ak written at the i^th position such that j ≠ k. But since she has recently found her true love, a frog Prince, and is in a hurry to meet him, you must help her solve the problem as fast as possible. Since the answer can be very large, print the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.  Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N. The second line contains N + 1 space-separated integers denoting A0 to AN.   Output   For each test case, output a single line containing an integer denoting the answer.    Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ Ai ≤ 10^9   Sub tasks  Example Input: 2 1 1 2 2 1 2 1  Output: 4 14  Explanation  There are 2 possible gameplays. A0A1 which gives score of 2 and  A1A0 which also gives score of 2. So the answer is 2 + 2 = 4  
 Vadim and Roman like discussing challenging problems with each other. One day Vadim told his friend following problem:  Given N points on a plane. Each point p is defined by it's two integer coordinates — px and py. The distance between points a and b is min(|ax - bx|, |ay - by|). You should choose a starting point and make a route visiting every point exactly once, i.e. if we write down numbers of points in order you visit them we should obtain a permutation. Of course, overall distance walked should be as small as possible. The number of points may be up to 40.  "40? Maybe 20? Are you kidding?" – asked Roman. "No, it's not a joke" – replied Vadim. So Roman had nothing to do, but try to solve this problem. Since Roman is really weak in problem solving and you are the only friend, except Vadim, with whom Roman can discuss challenging tasks, he has nobody else to ask for help, but you!   Input Input description. The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of points on a plane. The following N lines contain two space-separated integers each — coordinates of points.  Output Output description. Output the answer for every test case in a separate line. The answer for every test case is a permutation of length N. In case there are several solutions that lead to minimal distance walked, you should choose the lexicographically smallest one. Let P denote such permutation. To make output smaller, you should output H(P). H(P) = P1 xor P2 xor ... xor PN. Have a look at the example and it's explanation for better understanding.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ N ≤ 40 0 ≤ absolute value of each coordinate ≤ 1000 1 ≤ sum over all N in a single test file ≤ 120   Example Input: 2 2 1 2 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 3 Output: 3 0   Explanation For the first test case permutation [1, 2] is optimal.  1 xor 2 = 3.  For the second one both [2, 3, 1] and [1, 3, 2] lead us to the shortest walk, but the second one is lexicographically smaller. So the answer is H([1, 3, 2]) = 1 xor 3 xor 2 = 0 .

 The game of billiards involves two players knocking 3 balls around on a green baize table. Well, there is more to it, but for our purposes this is sufficient.  The game consists of several rounds and in each round both players obtain a score, based on how well they played. Once all the rounds have been played, the total score of each player is determined by adding up the scores in all the rounds and the player with the higher total score is declared the winner.  The Siruseri Sports Club organises an annual billiards game where the top two players of Siruseri play against each other. The Manager of Siruseri Sports Club decided to add his own twist to the game by changing the rules for determining the winner. In his version, at the end of each round the leader and her current lead are calculated. Once all the rounds are over the player who had the maximum lead at the end of any round in the game is declared the winner.   Consider the following score sheet for a game with 5 rounds:       Round     Player 1       Player 2        1             140                 82       2              89                 134       3              90                 110       4              112              106       5              88                  90   The total scores of both players, the leader and the lead after each round for this game is given below:      Round      Player 1       Player 2     Leader     Lead        1               140           	 82        Player 1     58       2               229           	216       Player 1     13       3               319           	326       Player 2      7       4               431           	432       Player 2      1       5               519           	522       Player 2      3   The winner of this game is Player 1 as he had the maximum lead (58 at the end of round 1) during the game.  Your task is to help the Manager find the winner and the winning lead. You may assume that the scores will be such that there will always be a single winner.  That is, there are no ties. Input  The first line of the input will contain a single integer N (N ≤ 10000) indicating the number of rounds in the game.  Lines 2,3,...,N+1 describe the scores of the two players in the N rounds. Line i+1 contains two integer Si and Ti, the scores of the Player 1 and 2 respectively, in round i.  You may assume that 1 ≤ Si ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ Ti ≤ 1000. Output  Your output must consist of a single line containing two integers W and L, where W is 1 or 2 and indicates the winner and L is the maximum lead attained by the winner. Example Input:  5 140 82 89 134 90 110 112 106 88 90  Output:  1 58 
Chef belongs to a very rich family which owns many gold mines. Today, he brought N gold coins and decided to form a triangle using these coins. Isn't it strange? Chef has a unusual way of forming a triangle using gold coins, which is described as follows:  He puts 1 coin in the 1^st row. then puts 2 coins in the 2^nd row. then puts 3 coins in the 3^rd row.  and so on as shown in the given figure.   Chef is interested in forming a triangle with maximum possible height using at most N coins. Can you tell him the maximum possible height of the triangle?  Input The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The first and the only line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the number of gold coins Chef has.  Output For each test case, output a single line containing an integer corresponding to the maximum possible height of the triangle that Chef can get.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^9   Example  Input 3 3 5 7  Output 2 2 3   Explanation  Test 1: Chef can't form a triangle with height > 2 as it requires atleast 6 gold coins. Test 2: Chef can't form a triangle with height > 2 as it requires atleast 6 gold coins. Test 3: Chef can't form a triangle with height > 3 as it requires atleast 10 gold coins.

 Chef wants to implement wildcard pattern matching supporting only the wildcard '?'. The wildcard character '?' can be substituted by any single lower case English letter for matching. He has two strings X and Y of equal length, made up of lower case letters and the character '?'. He wants to know whether the strings X and Y can be matched or not.  Input The first line of input contain an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines, the first line contains the string X and the second contains the string Y.  Output For each test case, output a single line with the word Yes if the strings can be matched, otherwise output No.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 50 Both X and Y have equal length and the length is between 1 and 10. Both X and Y consist of lower case letters and the character '?'.   Example Input: 2 s?or? sco?? stor? sco??  Output: Yes No  Explanation  First Example:  There are several ways the two strings can be matched, one of those is "score".   Second Example:  There is no way to match the strings.  
  	A version control system(VCS) is a repository of files, often the files for the source code of computer programs, with monitored access. Every change made to the source is tracked, along with who made the change, why they made it, and references to problems fixed, or enhancements introduced, by the change.   	Version control systems are essential for any form of distributed, collaborative development. Whether it is the history of a wiki page or large software development project, the ability to track each change as it was made, and to reverse changes when necessary can make all the difference between a well managed and controlled process and an uncontrolled ‘first come, first served’ system. It can also serve as a mechanism for due diligence for software projects.   	In this problem we'll consider a simplified model of a development project. Let's suppose, that there are N source files in the project. All the source files are distinct and numbered from 1 to N.   	A VCS, that is used for maintaining the project, contains two sequences of source files. The first sequence contains the source files, that are ignored by the VCS. If a source file is not in the first sequence, then it's considered to be unignored. The second sequence contains the source files, that are tracked by the VCS. If a source file is not in the second sequence, then it's considered to be untracked. A source file can either be or not be in any of these two sequences.   	Your task is to calculate two values: the number of source files of the project, that are both tracked and ignored, and the number of source files of the project, that are both untracked and unignored.   Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of the test case description contains three integers N, M and K denoting the number of source files in the project, the number of ignored source files and the number of tracked source files. The second line contains M distinct integers denoting the sequence A of ignored source files. The sequence is strictly increasing. The third line contains K distinct integers denoting the sequence B of tracked source files. The sequence is strictly increasing.  Output For each test case, output a single line containing two integers: the number of the source files, that are both tracked and ignored, and the number of the source files, that are both untracked and unignored.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ M, K ≤ N ≤ 100 1 ≤ A1 < A2 < ... < AM ≤ N 1 ≤ B1 < B2 < ... < BK ≤ N   Example Input: 2 7 4 6 1 4 6 7 1 2 3 4 6 7 4 2 2 1 4 3 4  Output: 4 1 1 1   Explanation  	In the first test case, the source files {1, 4, 6, 7} are both tracked and ignored, the source file {5} is both untracked and unignored.   	In the second test case, the source file {4} is both tracked and ignored, the source file {2} is both untracked and unignored.  
Chef is going to participate in a new quiz show: "Who dares to be a millionaire?" According to the rules of the game, contestants must answer N questions. The quiz being famous for its difficulty, each question has 26 candidate answers, but only one of which is correct. Answers are denoted by capital Latin letters from A to Z. Chef knows all the questions that can be asked, and for each of them he knows the answer candidate he will choose (some of them can be incorrect). For each question, we'll tell you Chef's answer to it. The game goes on as follows. First, all the questions are shuffled randomly. Then, a contestant is asked these questions one-by-one in the new shuffled order. If the contestant answers any question incorrectly, the game is over. Total winnings of the contestant are calculated as follows. Let X denote the number of questions answered correctly by the contestant. Depending on this value, the winnings are determined: W0 dollars is the amount won for X = 0, W1 dollars is for X = 1, and so on till X = N. Note that the game was invented by a twisted mind, and so a case where Wi ≥ Wi + 1 for some 0 ≤ i ≤ N − 1 is possible. Chef is interested in finding the maximum possible winnings that he can amass.  Input The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The  description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of questions. Next line contains N capital Latin letters denoting the correct answers to these questions. Next line contains N capital Latin letters denoting answers given by Chef to these questions. Next line contains N + 1 space-separated integers W0, W1, ..., WN denoting the winnings for 0, 1, ..., N correct answers.  Output For each test case, output a single line containing the value of maximum possible winnings that Chef can get.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 500 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000 0 ≤ Wi ≤ 10^9   Example Input: 3 5 ABCDE EBCDA 0 10 20 30 40 50 4 CHEF QUIZ 4 3 2 1 0 8 ABBABAAB ABABABAB 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100  Output: 30 4 100   Explanation Example case 1. If questions will be placed in order: 2^nd (Chef's answer is B, which is correct), 3^rd (Chef's answer is C, and it is correct as well), 4^th (Chef's answer is D, and he is right), 5^th (Chef's answer is A but correct answer is E and the game is over), 1^st, Chef will correctly answer 3 questions, and therefore win 30 dollars. Example case 2. Chef's answers for all questions are incorrect, so his winnings are W0 dollars. Example case 3. Since all Wi are equal to 100 dollars, Chef will win this sum in any possible case. 
 The Beginning This is a story of the time when human kind had spread its presence through out the galaxy and had established an empire in its own right . To rule the galaxy effectively and maintain law and order , the galaxy had been divided into sixty four sectors and laws were imposed as to how trade and other activities that were to take place be implemented  , of which the the vitals ones being : One can trade only a fixed amount of commodities , which has been predefined by the senate , in a sector . One can travel only to the sectors just after or before a given sector and in no other way . The map of the galaxy being :             64  63  62  61  60  59  58  57           49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56           48  47  46  45  44  43  42  41           33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40           32  31  30  29  28  27  26  25           17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24           16  15  14  13  12  11  10  09           01  02  03  04  05  06  07  08 If you are in Sector 05 , you can either go to Sector 06 or Sector 04 . If you are in Sector 09 , you can either go to Sector 08 or Sector 10 . To extend the empire further , the Senate decides to send an expedition beyond their current reaches of the Empire . The expedition was to travel through the galaxy following the laws and and get to Sector 64 . There , the Expedition would be fitted with Hyper Drives which would take them beyond the Galaxy . So a crew of the best explorers were chosen for the mission and they left on the Expedition , unaware of what lay ahead .  The Route  The space craft can carry a maximum amount of fuel of 5 units . It starts its journey from Sector 1 , where Earth is located and is given the amount of fuel present on Earth . For every sector traversed into , it loses one unit of fuel . The spacecraft may land in  any sector to refill its fuel supplies . The amount of fuel available on a base varies between 1 to 5 . The space craft has to pick up all the fuel that there is on offer at a given base in accordance with the trade agreements and it can not carry more fuel than its maximum capacity which implies that the maximum fuel on a base station it lands on can not be more than the difference between its maximum fuel capacity and fuel left in its reserve . When it lands on a base station , its data base is uploaded with the information about the amount of fuel present in the next five immediate bases based on which the captain decides their next base halt . The captain decides their halt in a way so as to ensure that they have the maximum amount of fuel left by the time they traverse into the last sector in their current database (which must not be their destination , Sector 64 ) and in case more than one option are available , the one that is farthest from their current location is chosen . In case the last sector on their database is Sector 64 , and the space craft can travel the distance without making any further landings , the captain will ensure that they make no further landings even if by the time they traverse into Sector 64 , they have no fuel left .   The captain also ensures that information about their next halt is sent to the head of the current base station before proceeding so that a rescue mission can be carried in case something goes wrong .

On reaching the final frontier of the Galaxy , Sector 64 , the crew found themselves in a situation they had not anticipated .  The base they were supposed to land on was completely destroyed without any trace . All they found on the base was a Teleport channel , an encrypted key and some encrypted data , apparently left behind by mistake . The captain decided to investigate and find out where the Teleport channel leads to and what information were left behind . To do this , he has to decrypt the key and find a code to decode the information and unlock the Teleport channel .  The key had been encrypted using an ancient encryption algorithm . In this algorithm , a digit is preceded as well as succeeded by a certain number of characters which decides the position of the digit in the unencrypted code .  The encrypted key has the following characters and their relative weight-age :  Z      the basic charcacter ( may be considered of unit value ) Q      equivalent to 3 Z E      equivalent to 5 Z T      equivalent to 7 Z U      equivalent to 9 Z  The characters which precede a digit add to its weight-age and which succeed a digit subtract from its weigh-age . The position of a digit in the unencrypted code is decided on the basis of its weight-age , the digit with the least weight-age is the left most and the digit with the most weight-age is the right most . In case of same weight-age for two digits , the digit that appears later in the encrypted key appears earlier in the unencrypted code .  Example :  ZZZE5UU7QQZZ7T3QQQQ4EEZ  weight-age of 5 : (3x1) + (1x5) - (2x9) = -10 weight-age of 7 : (2x9) - (2x3) - (2x1) = 10 weight-age of second 7 : (2x3)+(2x1) - (1x7) = 1 weight-age of 3 : (1x7) - (4x3) = - 5 weight-age of 4 : (4x3) - (2x5) - (1x1) = 1   Implying the unencrypted code is :  53477  Input  n N1 N2 N3 N4 .................N200 N1 N2 N3 N4 .................N200 ............ ............ n times  Where :  n : Number of test cases . 0 < n < 32000 .

On being teleported through the teleport channel , the crew reach Earth and find that the invaders have attacked the planet . They decide to join the war against the invaders .  Based on information available , the crew of the ship decides to analyze the probability of the Mother-ship of the invaders being in a sector and then focus their attacks on the ones with highest probability .  They decide the probability of the Mother-ship being in a particular sector based on the amount of protection it gets from the supporting Frigates in the grid . There are eight Frigates in the grid and no two of them are in the same sector .  The protection a sector receives from a Frigate is decided as follows :  Every Frigate has the ability to protect any sector in the row , column and diagonal it is located in . But it's ability to protect is maximum when the sector is just adjacent to it in it's row or column ( let us just call it as Protection Status 14 ) and then gradually falls at a rate of 2 units per sector as the distance increases ( as in , the sector next to its adjacent sector has Protection Status as 12 and so on ) . The protection of a sector along its diagonal is half the protection of a sector at same distance along the row or column , as in , the Protection Status of a sector adjacent to a frigate along its diagonals is 7 and it falls of as the distance increases at a rate of 1 unit per sector .  Also , if a sector is protected by more than one frigate , the Protection Status of that sector is the sum of the protections provided by all the Frigates for the sector in the grid .  Example  The map of the galaxy being :                  64  63  62  61  60  59  58  57                49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56                48  47  46  45  44  43  42  41                33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40                32  31  30  29  28  27  26  25                17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24                16  15  14  13  12  11  10  09                01  02  03  04  05  06  07  08    In the 8x8 grid , if a Frigate is at Sector 12  , it protects the following sectors ( with the Protection Status in bracket ) .  Row Elements : 11(14) , 10(12) , 09(10) , 13(14) , 14(12) , 15(10) , 16(08)  . Column Elements : 05(14) , 21(14) , 28(12) , 37(10) , 44(08) , 53 (06) .

If more than one sector has same protection status which also happens to be the highest , the sector numbers are to be output in an increasing order .

In the computer science class at the school in Byteland, the teacher handed out the following assignment as homework:   "For an integer n, let bn denote the bit parity of the binary representation of n, i.e. bnn has an even number of ones when written down in the binary system, and bnbn, for n ≥0,  form an infinite sequence of bits (zeros and ones). Given a sequence cc0, ..., cp-1) of p bits, find the first occurrence of sequence c as a subsequence of b (i.e., the smallest value of index k such that for all i between 0 and p-1, we have ci = bi+k)."  And the teacher gave his students several short sequences c, asking them to provide the answers next day. Most, as expected, wrote programs to solve the task. Only Johnny computed the results by hand, claiming (quite correctly) that it was quicker that way. The teacher, slightly exasperated, decided to teach Johnny a lesson, and prepared a harder assignment, just for him.  "Given a sequence cc0, ..., cp-1) of p bits, for each s between 0 and p-1, compute the first occurrence of the prefix (c0, ..., cs) of sequence c as a subsequence of b."  And to be doubly sure that Johnny does his homework using a computer, the teacher gave him some really long sequences to deal with. Now, Johnny is in a bit of a spot, because he has never bothered to learn to program. Please help him out!    Input The first line of input contains a positive integer t < 10, describing the number of tests. Exactly t test cases follow. Each test case is given in two lines. The first line contains integer p (1 ≤ p ≤ 10^6, the length of sequence k). The next line contains exactly p space-separated numbers (0 or 1), denoting successive elements of sequence c.   Output For each test case, print a line containing exactly p space-separated numbers, corresponding to the indexes of the first occurrence of successive prefixes of c as subsequences of b. All indexes are numbered starting from zero. If there is no such occurrence, output -1.  Example  Input: 1 9 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0  Output: 1 2 4 4 8 8 8 -1 -1   Explanation: The first 16 elements of b are: 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0  The prefix '1' first appears in b at index 1, The prefix '1 0' first appears in b at index 2, The prefixes '1 0 0' and '1 0 0 1' first appear in b at index 4, ... and so on. There are no occurences of '1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1' in sequence b. 
  Problem description.  Arpit was facing a dillema of whether he could make it the higher divison known as Division 1 of competitive coders in his school . To confirm his spot his Computer Science professor gave him a task :  We define AND operation as it is defined normally where we get a output 1 if both inputs are 1 otherwise the output is 0 . The problem involves two matrices A and B having n rows and m columns where the formation of B matrix is done from A matrix as follows :  B(i , j) = A(i,1) & A(i,2) & ....A(i,m) & A(1,j) & A(2,j) ....& A(n,j)  ( More formally each element of B matrix is the AND of all elements in the i row and j column of matrix A )  You will be given B matrix and you have to tell whether its possible to form A matrix or not as "YES" or "NO" As it has been a long time for Arpit not making Division 1 he asks you for help !!    Input The first line consists 'n and m' where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns  Next n lines contains m numbers representing the B matrix  Output "YES" or "NO" whether its possible to form matrix A or not !!  Constraints 1<=n , m<=100  Example Input: 2 3 1 0 1 0 0 0  Output: YES

  You get bored sometimes and love to play the game Chain reaction. This game is played upon a board of size RxC. Initially, the board is empty. In each turn, you can place an atom in any cell you want. After each turn, if the number of atoms in a cell becomes greater than 3, it will explode and one atom will spread to each of the four sides. If any other atoms remain( ie no of atoms > 4), it remains in the same cell. As you can see, this will create a chain reaction if the adjacent cells contain 3 atoms already.  If explosion occurs at edge cells or corner cells, some atoms are lost permanently. This also makes sure that the board will always reach a stable state after some number of explosions.      You will be given the board size and the state of the board after some moves. Next you will make N moves. Write a program that prints the final stable state of the board after N moves.   Input First line contains the number of test cases T. First line of each test case will have 2 integers R and C, R is the row size, C is the column size. Then R lines follow, each line containing C integers, denoting the number of atoms at that cell. Next line will have a single integer N , the number of moves that you make N lines follow, each containing two integers, x and y denoting the cell (x, y) where you add a new atom.     Output For each test case print the final state of the board. It must contain R lines, each having C space separated integers.    Constraints 1<=T<=100 2<=R<=20 , 2<=C<=20 Number of atoms in each cell will be less than 4. 0<=x 1<=N<=1000   Example Input: 1 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0   Output:  1 0 1 0 0 0 2 1 2 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 2 1 2 0 0 0 1 0 0    Explanation  After adding the atom to (2, 2), it explodes which will cause all four adjacent cells (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2) to explode. This will lead to explosion of the cell (2, 2) for the second time as all those four cells sends back an atom to this cell. After adding the atom to (0, 0), no explosion occurs. 
Statement                     Mario is one the most famous video games ever. In this problem, we will be helping Mario save the princess(again :P). In this game of mario, each world will be represented by a 2-D rectangular grid. There are multiple worlds and all the worlds are of size RxC. The world contains many objects each covering exactly one cell. The cell with ‘S’ denotes Mario’s starting position. A cell with ‘.’ denotes an empty cell over which Mario can walk safely. From that cell he can move to any of its 4 adjacent cells (which share an edge with it). A cell with ‘D’ denotes a pipe that leads to the world below. A cell with ‘U’ denotes a pipe that leads to the world above. If Mario enters a cell containing a pipe, he must enter the pipe. A cell with ‘C’ represents a coin and Mario collects these. After collecting the coin, the cell becomes an empty cell. A cell with ‘#’ denotes bricks and Mario can’t enter this cell no matter what. A cell with ‘M’ denotes the monster(Bowser), Mario has to defeat Bowser to save the princess. Mario initially start from an empty cell. Our Mario is very determined and so he will be always able to defeat Bowser on a 1 on 1 battle. But he is greedy and will always want to collect all the coins before going to save the princess. If he is not able to collect all the coins, he won’t save the princess! Help Mario to find the minimum number of steps to do this feat. Note: 	If ‘U’ is present in topmost world or ‘D’ is present in the bottommost world, Mario can’t enter the cell. Input format: 	Input contains multiple test cases.         First line of each test case will have 3 integers R, C and W. ‘R X C’ represents Grid dimension and ‘W’ represents number of worlds. It will be followed by R X W lines. Each line will have ‘C’ characters. First R lines describe the first world, second R lines describe the second world and so on upto W worlds. 	Input ends by the line, “0 0 0”. Output format: 	For each test case, print a single line “Mario saved the princess in K steps” where K is the minimum number of steps if he defeat the monster else Print “Mario failed to save princess”. constraints: 	1<=R,C<=15 	1<=W<=9 	0<=C<=10 	All characters in the grid will be from the set {‘S’, ‘.’, ‘M’, ‘C’, ‘D’, ‘U’, ‘#’ } INPUT:        	3 3 2         S.M         C#.

  Geek Sundaram lives in Geek City. As he is an ardent coder, he never gets to go out and leads a sedentary lifestyle. One day he realises he is getting fat and decides to something about it. He decides to go jogging every morning. Geek City is a rectangular city with M X N grids. Each grid can be occupied by a building or can be empty. Occupied grids are marked using '#' and empty grids are denoted by '*'. The residents of Geek city can travel through any grid but the Mayor of Geek City has decreed that residents should not jog inside buildings. From a grid, Geek can go left, right, up or down if there is a grid in that direction. Naturally, Geek Sundaram has to jog along a path of empty grids. The length of a path is the number of grids present in that path. Also, Geek city is constructed such that, while jogging along a path of empty grids, one will not revisit the same grid again without changing his/her direction. Can you help Geek find the length of the longest path he can jog along?    Input  The first line of the input contains two integers M and N denoting the number of rows and columns of grids. Each of the following M lines have N characters, the characters being either '#' or '*'.     Output Output a single line containing the length of the longest path Geek can jog along.  Constraints  1 ≤ M,N ≤ 500     Example Input: 3 4 #*#* #*** ###*  Output: 5   
  To attain inner peace  Geek Sundaram  has to pass through the "Hall of Valley of Death". The floor of this hall is a square with length 100 m. It is laid with square tiles of size  1 X 1  arranged over the entire hall. But, at some places in the hall tiles are broken. The moment a person enters the hall, the underworld awakens and dead souls emerge from these broken tiles. The only way to escape from these evil souls is to completely cover the broken locations with magic planks from the room of requirements. Each plank has size 100 X 1 and can only be placed parallel to either sides of the floor. Now Geek Sundaram has to save himself from these evil souls. He figures out that he has to use the minimum number of planks possible. Please help Geek Sundaram to attain inner peace.  Input   The first line of the input is a positive integer t <= 30, denoting the number of halls.  The descriptions for the t halls follow one after the other.  Hall Description:   The first line of the hall description is a positive integer n (n  <=  10000), denoting the number of broken tile locations.  This is followed by the n lines, one for each broken tile location.  Each line contains two integers x y (0 <= x, y < 100), separated by a single space, representing the co-ordinates of the broken tile location.     Output The output should consist of t lines, one for each hall. The k^th line in the output should be an integer mk, the minimum number of planks needed for the k^th hall.     Example Input: 2 3 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4   Output: 1 4    
  Geek Sundaram is extremely anxious. He is in a hectic schedule. He has to study for his assessment the next day, watch FRIENDS tv show (in spite of watching every episode more than 5 times.. :P ), prepare questions for the programming contest and also complete his projects. So his friends try to calm him down by advising whether he can complete all his tasks in the given time period.  Given the time taken (in seconds) to study S, to watch TV W, to prepare questions Q and do project  P  and the total time available until the deadline T, print "YES" if Geek can complete all the tasks within the deadline, otherwise print "NO". (quotes for clarity)  P.S. Geek doesn't have the power to multi task  Input  The first line of the input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases. The description of t test cases follows." The first and the only line of each test case contains five integers S, W, Q, P, T as described in the problem.     Output For each test case, output a single line "YES" or "NO".    Constraints  1 ≤  t  ≤ 10 ^6 1 ≤  S, W, Q, P, T  ≤ 10 ^18     Example Input: 2 10 20 30 40 500 1 2 3 4 5  Output: YES NO    
Once Abhi got a call from his friend Priya. Priya needs some help in solving a Matrix problem as she is trapped by a monster. Abhi has X level of intelligence. There is a matrix M of size P*P, which have all values from 1 to P^2. Abhi has to traverse through all the values of the matrix exactly once. He will start his journey from 1, then to P^2, then to 2, then to P^2-1,then to 3 and so on till every value of the matrix covered exactly once. He can move to any of the adjacent cells from a cell(adjacent cells share an edge between them). Moving from a cell to its adjacent cell will reduce intelligence level of Abhi by 1. He can keep moving only when his intelligence level is greater than zero. Abhi has to complete his journey (at the end of the journey X should be greater or equal to zero). If he can complete the journey, Priya will remain alive, otherwise she will eaten by the monster.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains an integer P denoting the size of matrix and an integer X denoting the intelligence level of Abhi. Each of the next P lines contain P integers denoting the values in the rows of the matrix.  Output For each test case, print "ALIVE" if Priya will remain alive else print "DEAD" if she will be eaten up by the monster. Output your answer in a single line without quotes.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ P ≤ 500 0 ≤ X ≤ 10^9   Example Input: 2 2 4 1 4 2 3 3 15 2 7 3 4 1 5 9 8 6  Output: ALIVE DEAD  Explanation Example case 2. He will visit the Matrix in following order (2,2)->(3,1)->(1,1)->(3,2)->(1,3)->(1,2)->(2,1)->(3,3)->(2,3) His intelligence level will be as follows {15}->{13}->{11}->{8}->{5}->{4}->{2}->{-1}->{-2} (not possible) Abhi can not move from number 4 to 6 as he will have insufficient level of intelligence. 
Abhi and his friends (Shanky,Anku and Pandey) love to play with strings. Abhi invented a simple game. He will give a string S to his friends. Shanky and Anku will play the game while Pandey is just a spectator. Shanky will traverse the string from beginning (left to right) while Anku will traverse from last (right to left). Both have to find the first character they encounter during their traversal,that appears only once in the entire string. Winner will be one whose character is alphabetically more superior(has higher ASCII value). When it is not possible to decide the winner by comparing their characters, Pandey will be the winner.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. Each test case contains a string S having only lowercase alphabets ( a..z ).  Output For each test case, output a single line containing "SHANKY" if Shanky is the winner or "ANKU" if Anku is the winner or "PANDEY" if the winner is Pandey. Output your answer without quotes.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 < |S| ≤ 10^5   Example Input: 3 google breakraekb aman  Output: SHANKY PANDEY ANKU   Explanation Example case 2. Both Shanky and Anku can not find any such character. Hence it is not possible to decide the winner between these two. So Pandey is the winner. 
 In mathematics, the absolute value (or modulus) |a| of a real number a is the numerical value of a without regard to its sign. So, for example, the absolute value of 3 is 3, and the absolute value of -3 is also 3. The absolute value of a number may be thought of as its distance from zero.   Input  There is a single positive integer T on the first line of input. It stands for the number of numbers to follow. Then there are T lines, each containing exactly one integer number N ,  -10000 ≤ N ≤ 10000   Output  For every input number N, output a single line containing the absolute value of N.   Example  Input: 4 -9 -4 6 -1 Output: 9 4 6 1

Sherlock Holmes has decided to start a new academy to some of the young lads. He has conducted several tests and finally selected N equally brilliant students.Now he don't know whether to train all the N students or not. Now since Holmes was in a confusion, Watson came up with an idea. He wanted to test the obedience of the students. So during the camp, the students were given some Swiss Chocolates as gifts each time when they passed a level.Now some of them have finished eating all the chocolates, some of them had some remaining. Now to test their team chemistry and IQ skills, Watson told the lads to arrange themselves in such a way that,  number of chocolates of the ith kid should be equal to the sum of   (i-1)th kid and (i-2)th kid. Now they have arranged themselves in an order. Now Sherlock announced that he will select the students who have formed the line according to this order. But since there can be many such small groups among the entire N kids, he will select a sequence of kids such that the length of the sequence is maximized, meanwhile satisfying the above condition   Input First line is an integer T which denotes the total number of test cases. Each of the next T lines contains an integer N which denotes, N students. The next line contains N spaced integers.where it denotes the order in which the kids arranged themselves.  Output Each line contains an integer which denotes the maximum number of students among the N students who have arranged themselves according the rule said by Watson.It is guaranteed that Holmes will select atleast 1 or 2 students  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ Each of next N integers ≤ 10^9   Example Input: 2 5 2 3 5 1 2 3 1 2 3  Output: 3 3    Explanation Example case 1. Here the first kid has 2 chocolates, second has 3 chocolates, third kid has 5 chocolates, which is the sum of first kid's total chocolates and second kid's chocolate. Forth student has only 1 chocolate where he did not follow the rule. So the maximum number of kids who arranged themselves in the order was 3. That is students at index 1 to index 3. 
After the huge success of Mangalyaan this year, the ISRO (Indian Space Research Organization) is planning to launch a manned mission to Mars named Mangalyaan-2, in 2015. They obviously would want to select the best astronauts for this space mission. ISRO's research team has examined N available astronauts and computed a fitness score for each of them. It has been decided that astronauts with fitness score greater than or equal to a threshold score P, are eligible for the mission. Can you report the number of eligible astronauts?  Input The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then for each test case, the first line contains two space separated integers N and P denoting number of astronauts and the threshold score respectively. The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the fitness scores of the astronauts. Note: All fitness scores are distinct and are given in descending order.  Output For each test case, output the number of astronauts eligible for the mission on a separate line.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ N ≤ 100 1 ≤ P ≤ 1000 1 ≤ Ai ≤ 1000   Example Input: 3 3 10 7 3 1 3 5 7 3 1 3 1 7 3 1  Output: 0 1 3   Explanation In the first case, no astronauts are selected as none of them have fitness score greater than or equal to 10. In the second case, the astronaut with score 7 is selected. In the third case, all astronauts are selected. 
ISRO has shot to global fame after Mangalyaan. They have decided to build hi-tech ground stations throughout the country which can be used either as a control station or as a launch station (but not as both simultaneously). A control station is one which has all controls to the rocket. A launch station is the site from where a rocket is launched. For a successful launch, ISRO has identified that they need 2 control stations and that these 2 control stations should be equidistant from the launch station. Initially there is only one ground station having index 0, where the headquarters of ISRO is located. Over a period of time, they plan to build more and more ground stations. They can perform two kinds of operations (for given V):    Type 0: Build a new ground station and construct a one-way road from the ground station having index V to the newly built ground station. In other words, if the index of the newly built ground station is W, then a one way road V->W having length = 1 is constructed. The index of the new ground station will be the smallest positive integer which is not the index of any existing ground station. (Of course, this also helps them to keep track of the number of ground stations they have built so far.)    Type 1: Given a ground station with index V, count how many unordered pairs (P, Q) of ground stations exist such that the ground stations P and Q are both reachable from V (paths from V to P and V to Q exist),  and there exists a ground station R (need not be reachable from V), such that distance(P, R) = distance(Q, R), R ≠ P, R ≠ Q and P ≠ Q. Of course, ISRO wants to know this information beforehand since such pairs (P, Q) are possible candidates for control stations, and R is a possible candidate for the launch station.     Adding more explanation "Given a ground station with index V, count how many unordered pairs (P, Q) of ground stations exist such that the ground stations P and Q are both reachable from V (paths from V to P and V to Q exist), and there exists a ground station R (need not be reachable from V), such that distance(P,R) = distance(Q, R), R ≠ P, R ≠ Q and P ≠ Q."  As this says, there need not be path from R->P or P->R. How ever please use the following as definition of distance.  Distance(X, Y) = Number of roads in the unique path from X to Y, if the given road network were bi-directional.  Please note that, V->P and V->Q should still exist in directed road network.   Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer M denoting the number of operations. Each of the next M lines contain 2 integers -  type and V. if type = 0, then perform type 0 operation (for given V). if type = 1, then perform type 1 operation (for given V).  Output For each test case, for each query of type 1, you must print the answer to the query on a separate line.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 5 1 ≤ M ≤ 100000 0 ≤ type ≤ 1 For both type of operations 0 & 1, the given ground station V would have already been built.   Example Input: 2 4 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 6 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 2 1 1  Output: 0 1 1 2   Explanation Example case 1: First operation is of type 1. There is only 1 ground station (with index 0), so number of pairs are 0. Second operation is of type 0. A new ground station with index 1 is built, and a road from 0->1 (having length 1) is added. Third operation is of type 0 again. A new ground station with index 2 is built, and a road from 1->2 (having length 1) is added. Fourth operation is of type 1. There are 3 ground stations now. (0, 2) is the only valid pair as there exists ground station 1 with distance(2, 1) = distance(0, 1) = 1, and both the stations 0 & 2 are reachable from 0. Example case 2: There are 2 operations of type 1. For the first one, (0, 2) is the only valid pair, and for the second one, there are 2 valid pairs pairs - (2, 3) and (1, 4). 
"The Mars Orbiter Mission probe lifted-off from the First Launch Pad at Satish Dhawan Space Centre (Sriharikota Range SHAR), Andhra Pradesh, using a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) rocket C25 at 09:08 UTC (14:38 IST) on 5 November 2013". The secret behind this successful launch was the launch pad that ISRO used. An important part of the launch pad is the launch tower. It is the long vertical structure which supports the rocket. ISRO now wants to build a better launch pad for their next mission. For this, ISRO has acquired a long steel bar, and the launch tower can be made by cutting a segment from the bar. As part of saving the cost, the bar they have acquired is not homogeneous. The bar is made up of several blocks, where the i^th block has durability S[i], which is a number between 0 and 9. A segment is defined as any contiguous group of one or more blocks. If they cut out a segment of the bar from i^th block to j^th block (i<=j), then the durability of the resultant segment is given by ( S[i]*10^(j-i) + S[i+1]*10^(j-i-1) + S[i+2]*10^(j-i-2) + … + S[j] * 10^(0) ) % M. In other words, if W(i,j) is the base-10 number formed by concatenating the digits S[i], S[i+1], S[i+2], …, S[j], then the durability of the segment (i,j) is W(i,j) % M. For technical reasons that ISRO will not disclose, the durability of the segment used for building the launch tower should be exactly L. Given S and M, find the number of ways ISRO can cut out a segment from the steel bar whose durability is L.  Input The first line contains a string S. The i^th character of this string represents the durability of i^th segment. The next line contains a single integer Q, denoting the number of queries. Each of the next Q lines contain two space separated integers, denoting M and L.  Output For each query, output the number of ways of cutting the bar on a separate line.  Constraints  1 ≤ |S| ≤ 2 * 10^4 Q ≤ 5 0 < M < 500 0 ≤ L < M   Example Input: 23128765 3 7 2 9 3 15 5  Output: 9 4 5   Explanation For M=9, L=3, the substrings whose remainder is 3 when divided by 9 are: 3, 31287, 12 and 876. 
ISRO is planning to build a landing platform on MARS as a part of MOM. It has selected a small 2-D rectangular region for the same, and every point in the region has a strength associated with it. The landing platform should be in the form of a cross (see definition below for more details) and as strong as possible. The selected 2-D rectangular region has M * N points represented by (x, y), for all 0 <= x < M, 0 <= y < N. Let W[i][j] denote the strength of the point (i, j). We define a cross as follows:    It consists of 2 line segments of equal length. The end points of the line segments should coincide with any of the given M * N points.   Each of the line segments are at an angle of 45° with both the X & Y axis.   Both the line segments intersect exactly at one point, and their centres coincide. (i.e) if the 2 line segments are represented by { (x11, y11), (x12, y12) }, { (x21, y21), (x22, y22)  }, then (x11+x12) / 2 = (x21+x22) / 2 and (y11+y12) / 2 = (y21+y22) / 2. The point where the 2 line segments intersect is called the center of the cross.   Each line segment of the cross should have a non-zero length. Hence, a single point cannot be considered as a cross.    The strength of a cross is defined as the sum of strengths of all points that lie on it. Your task is to find the cross with maximum strength, which ISRO would like to use as the landing platform.  Input The first line contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then for each test case, the first line contains two integers M and N. Each of the following M lines, contain N space separated integers, where the j^th integer on the i^th line denotes W[i-1][j-1], for all 1 <= i <= M, 1 <= j <= N.  Output For each test case, output a single integer denoting the strength of the maximum-strength cross, on a separate line  Constraints  T ≤ 100 2 ≤ M ≤ 100 2 ≤ N ≤ 100 -10^6 ≤ W[i][j] ≤ 10^6   Example Input: 2 3 3 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 2 3 0 1 -2 2 3 1  Output: -1 6    Explanation In the first case, the cross formed by the line segments {(0, 0), (2, 2)} and {(0, 2), (2, 0)} has the maximum strength = 1+(-1)+1+(-1)+(-1) = -1. Note: You cannot choose a cross with 0 strength (not passing through any of the given points) here, because it is given that each line segment of the cross should pass through atleast one of the given points In the second case, the cross formed by the line segments {(0, 0), (1, 1)} and {(0, 1), (1, 0)} has the maximum strength = 0+3+1+2 = 6 
The ISRO (Indian Space Research Organization) has recently built a supercomputer with the help of C-DAC (Center for Development of Advanced Computing), for processing data generated from MOM (Mars Orbiter Mission). Before using it for real data, they want to test it out with the following problem, as they feel it is very hard for a normal computer to solve this problem. Given a number N, find the sum of f(x) for all x such that 1 <= x <= N. f(x) is defined as the sum of all digits in base 10 representation of the number x. For example, f(121) = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4. As the number N is very big, it is given in the following run length encoded format - N is represented as a sequence of M blocks, where each block i (0 <= i < M) is represented by two integers - (len[i], d[i]). This implies that the digit d[i] occurs len[i] number of times. For example, {(2,1), (1,2), (2,9)} represents the number 11299. Can you help them by writing a solution to validate the supercomputer's output? Note: There will be no leading zeros in the given number.  Input The first line contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer M. Each of the following M lines contain 2 space separated integers, where the i^th line describes the i^th block with length len[i] and digit d[i] respectively.  Output For each test case, print the result modulo 1000000007 on a separate line.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 25 1 ≤ M ≤ 10000 d[0] > 0 0 ≤ d[i] ≤ 9 1 ≤ len[i] ≤ 10^18 1 ≤ Total length of N ≤ 10^18   Example Input: 2 1 1 5 2 1 1 1 0  Output: 15 46    Explanation For case 1, the N is 5 and the result is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15. For case 2, the N is 10 and the result is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + (1 + 0) = 46. 
Laxman is doing Diwali shopping. There are N shops numbered from 1 to N. Laxman wants to buy M different types of crackers. Crackers are numbered from 1 to M. Each shop sells many types of crackers. Laxman is currently at the i'th shop. Laxman want to find j and k, such that j <= i and k ≥ i and he can buy all M types of crackers only by visiting shops in the range of j to k. If there are multiple valid j, k, he then want to minimize the window size, that is, minimize the value of k - j. If there are still multiple valid j, k, then he wants to minimize the value of j. It is also known that, by visiting all the N shops, Laxman can surely buy all M types of crackers. Write a program to output j, k values for all valid i.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each test case is described as follows, First line of each test case has 2 integers, N and M. Following N lines describe the shops. Each of the N lines starts with an integer X, which denotes the number of different types of crackers sold in that shop. X integers follow describing the cracker types. All the X integers are different.  Output For each test case output N lines, One for each i, 1 <= i <= N. Each line should contain two integers, j and k.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10000 1 ≤ N ≤ 100000 1 ≤ M ≤ 100000 0 ≤ X ≤ 100000 1 ≤ Sum of N over all test cases ≤ 500000 1 ≤ Sum of M over all test cases ≤ 500000 1 ≤ Sum of X over all test cases ≤ 500000   Example Input: 2 3 3 1 1 1 2 1 3 3 3 1 1 2 2 3 1 1  Output: 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 2 1 2 2 3  Explanation Test case #1: Laxman needs to visit all 3 shops to but all M types  Test case #2: Laxman needs to visit shops 1, 2 to get all M types. Or he can visit shops 2, 3 to get all M types. For i = 2, we could have bought all types from shops 2 3, but we prefer 1 2 because 1 < 2, as stated in the statement we want to minimize j in case of tie.  
Ram has N different crackers. These crackers are very special, each of them can fire infinite number of fire-balls. Ram made an arrangement with those N crackers. If the spark is currently with the i'th cracker, it will first fire a fire-ball, and then it will pass the spark to the (i+1)'th cracker. Note that the N'th cracker will pass spark to the 1'st cracker. Ram initially placed the spark at the a'th cracker. However the spark will get exhausted after M passes, that is, it gets off during M+1'th pass. Ram want to know which cracker will fire the last fire-ball before spark goes off. Write a program to print this answer.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Following T lines describe the test cases, one per line. Each line contains 3 integers, N, a and M.  Output For each test case output one line, which contains the required answer.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 1000 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000 0 ≤ M ≤ 1000 1 ≤ a ≤ N   Example Input: 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 5 1 19  Output: 4 1 5  Explanation Test case #1: Spark is initially at the 1'st cracker. It fires a fire-ball and passes spark to the 2'nd cracker. The 2'nd cracker fires a fire-ball and passes the spark to the 3'rd cracker. The 3rd cracker fires a fire-ball and passes spark to the 4th cracker. The 4th cracker fires a fire-ball and passes the spark to the 5'th cracker, however, we already made 3 passes and this is 4th pass, so spark gets off. The last cracker to fire a fire-ball is the 4'th cracker.  Test case #2: Spark is initially at the 1'st cracker. It fires a fire-ball and passes spark to the 2'nd cracker. After the 4'th pass, the spark is with the 5'th cracker. The 5'th cracker fires a fire-ball and passes it to the 1'st cracker (Read the statement carefully, the N'th cracker passes spark to the 1'st cracker). The 1'st cracker fires the fire-ball and passes to the 2'nd cracker, spark gets exhausted during this pass. So the last cracker to fire was the 1'st.  
Sita went to buy some crackers. They offered special discount for the ones who solve a puzzle. Sita could not solve it, she came to you for help. Following is the puzzle. A mapping "a->b" means that you can transform letter 'a' to letter 'b'. You are given M such mappings. You are given two strings S and T. Write a program which determines if S can be transformed to T using the provided mappings. You can select any position in S and apply any of the M mappings on it. You can do this any number of times. Each mapping can be used any number of times.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer P denoting the number of test cases. First line of each test case has the string S. Second line of each test case has the string T Third line of each test case has M. Following M lines describes the mappings, one per line.  Output For each test case output one line, print "YES" if it is possible to transfrom S to T. print "NO" if not possible.  Constraints  1 ≤ P ≤ 1000 1 ≤ |S|, |T| ≤ 1000 0 ≤ M ≤ 1000 S and T contain lower case English alphabet only All mappings are from lower case English alphabet to lower case English alphabet Length of S and T need not be equal.   Example Input: 3 aa bb 1 a->b ab ba 2 a->b b->a a b 1 b->a Output: YES YES NO  Explanation Test case #1: Clearly 'a' can be transformed to 'b'. So "aa" can be transformed to "bb"  Test case #2: 'a' can be transformed to 'b' by using mapping 1. 'b' can be transformed to 'a' by using mapping 2 Test case #3: 'b' can be transformed to 'a' but 'a' cannot be transformed to 'b'. So it is not possible. 
Hanuman was the army chief in the war against ravana, he helped Ram. Well, everyone knew about that, but did you know that Hanuman also helped people of byteland? Let me tell you the story!! Long long ago, on the day of diwali, people were unhappy with the crackers they had. They wanted to do some swaps with others and get the crackers they like, but they had lot of fights due to lack of rules. They all went to lord Hanuman for help, Hanuman asked them to follow few rules for peace. Firstly, Hanuman did the following,  1) Hanuman, numbered all the people starting from 1. There are N people in all. 2) Lord also numbered the crackers in order starting from 1. There are N*5 crackers. 3) He gave each of them 3 crackers to start with. Person numbered i, got crackers (3*i)-2, (3*i)-1, 3*i. 4) Hanuman kept rest of the crackers with him.   Following are the rules given, 1) Each person gets his chance to ask for swap of crackers. This starts with person numbered 1, then 2, 3, 4 ... and ends with person numbered N. Any person, in his turn, can request for 3 swaps at the most. Note that they can also request for swap for crackers that are with Hanuman. 2) When a person asks for a swap, the other person should obey it and allow the swap.   Note that, after the process described above, each person will get 3 crackers. Having said that, Hanuman told the people to start the process. Let me also tell you about what the people prefer (In that order) 1) They always want their crackers numbered in order. (Example : 1, 2, 3 or 12,11,10 but not 10, 11, 13) 2) Each person has a preference number P[i], they want their least-numbered cracker to be ≥ P[i] and as least as possible. 3) If he could not get set of crackers satisfying condition 1 and 2, he will then try to get his least-numbered cracker to be as least as possible (Leaving about ≥ P[i] condition) Note:  No person will ever break 1st condition. He will always try and get 3 ordered crackers. After that, they will try to follow 2nd condition, and if that is not possible then they move to the 3rd condition.   All N people are smart. They all make optimal choice. They all also know that others will always make optimal choice. Every person also knows about every other persons preference number (P[ ]). Your task is to write a program, given N and P[ ], output the least-numbered cracker each person will end up with when everyone make optimal choice of swaps.   Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each test case is as follows, First line of each test case has one integer, N. Second line of each test case contains N integers representing the array P[ ]  Output For each test case output one line with N integers, i'th integer being the least-numbered cracker received by i'th person  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10000 1 ≤ N ≤ 100000 1 ≤ P[i] ≤ N*5 1 ≤ Sum of N over all test cases ≤ 500000   Example Input: 2 2 1 5 2 4 9  Output: 1 5 4 1  Explanation Test case #1: First person does not make any swaps. He is happy with the crackers he has (1, 2, 3). Second person swaps cracker-4 with cracker-7 to get the crackers (5, 6, 7). This is to follow 2nd condition.  Test case #2: First person makes 3 swaps (1<->4, 2<->5, 3<->6). At this moment, first person has (4, 5, 6) and the second person has (1, 2, 3) In this case, second person preference number is 9. But there are only 10 crackers, so he cannot get (9, 10, 11), it is impossible to follow condition 1 and 2, for that reason he decided to follow 1st and 3rd condition. Which means he want to minimize his least-numbered cracker. Second person will not request for any swaps as he already has (1, 2, 3)  
Ram brought home N identical crackers, and arranged them in a row. He then numbered all the crackers with positive integer numbers such that product of any two numbers is less than or equal to K. He also ensured that the numbers read from left most cracker to right most cracker are in non-decreasing order. Ravana took away all the crackers when Ram was not at home. To keep things simple, Cool dude Laxman brought N new identical crackers. Now he want to number them following the conditions Ram followed, but he realized that there are multiple ways to do it. Given N and K, write a program to output the number of ways to number the crackers. If there are infinite ways to do it, output "-1" instead.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Only line of each testcase contains two integer numbers N and K.  Output For each test case output one line. If the number of ways is infinite print "-1". If the number of ways is finite, print the required answer modulo 1000000007.  Constraints  1 ≤ T, N, K ≤ 100000   Example Input: 2 2 1 2 2 Output: 1 2  Explanation Test case #1: We need to number 2 crackers. And the product of any two numbers should not exceed 1. The only possible numbering is "1 1"  Test case #2: In this case the product of any two numbers should not exceed 2. Two possible ways are "1 1" and "1 2". Note that "2 1" is invalid because Ram ensured that the numbering from left to right is non-decreasing.  
 Like all other teams, the LaZyProblemSetters (consisting of V, J and S) are also participating in ICPC with high hopes for qualifying for the world finals. They would like to go to the world finals to represent their country and bring back a medal. However, first they have to clear the prelims contest. For that, they have decided to have a practice round before the prelims. They are going to have the practice round from time S to E. However, the team members are not so sure whether they would be able to participate in the practice contest for the whole duration as they already have some previous reservations. To solve that, they have created a list of all the things everyone is supposed to do or reservations they have to fulfil.  The list they prepared has a total of N tasks. They have also noted down the time in which each task needs to be done, i.e. the start time and the end time. During that time, at least one of the team members is busy doing that task and would be unavailable for the ICPC pre-prelims practice contest.   You are given the time slot LaZyProblemSetters have decided to practice together and the list of tasks with their start and end time that they prepared. Print whether they all would be able to practice together for the full duration of the contest. For this problem, you can assume that if V, J or S ends a task at time T1, he can give his undivided attention to the contest starting from T1 itself and if the contest ends at time T2, they can get back to their reserved tasks at T2 itself.   Input The first line of the input contains an integer T, the number of test cases in a file. Then T test cases follow each of which has the following structure: The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers S and E. The second line of each test case contains N. Then N lines follow each of which contains two space separated integers, xi and yi, the start and the end time of the i^th task.  Output For each test case, print "YES" (without quotes) if the team members can practice together for the full duration of the pre-prelims contest, print "NO" (without quotes) otherwise in a new line.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 3 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ S < E  ≤  10^18 1 ≤ xi < yi ≤  10^18   Example Input: 1 10 20 3 1 10 21 50 30 33  Output: YES   
As we all know that team LaZyProblemSetters with participants V, J and K is gearing up for ICPC 2015, and have decided to solve a problem set to practice for the prelims round. The day of that practice round has now arrived and they are very eager to get started. They have picked up an ordered set of N problems to solve. Now, since they are newbies in the field of programming, they have chosen problems which are not so tough. Hence, every problem that they have taken is solvable by all the three members.   To make it feel like the regional contest, they have decided to use only a single computer system.Since they are newbies, instead of optimizing on time and resources they have come up with the following plan to decide on how they would attempt to solve the problems.    They have divided their total time in N time slots.  In the i^th time slot, they will code up the i^th problem. Since they are easy problems, it is known that each problem would be solved within the given time slot.  In each time slot, the computer will be allotted to either V, J or K. They will not share the computer with anyone else in the time slot allocated to them.   Now all that is left is to decide who will solve which problem on the computer. To make things easier, all of them have listed their requirements on how the distribution of the problems should be.   K being a lover of the number k has decided that the total number of problems coded by him will be a multiple of k. J being a busy guy decided to never code problems in consecutive slots. In the gaps between his slots, he has some other work that he wants to finish. V being a relatively new coder, wants to code at least one problem from the whole set.   Your task is to find out the number of ways in which they can distribute the problems amongst themselves.   Input First line of the input will contain an integer T, the number of test cases to follow. Next T lines follow. Each line will represent a test case containing two space separated integers N and k.   Output For each input, print the number of ways in which V, J and K can distribute the problems amongst themselves in a new line. Since, it can be a very large number, output it modulo 10000007.  Constraints  0 ≤ k ≤ 10 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^18 The constraint on T can be computed from below.   Test Data Generation The value of T in an input file is determined by the following rule: For an input file, we keep an integer variable total (initialized to 0). For each test case in the input file, we take the value of k in the test case and update total as follows:    if k > 0, total = total + k  if k == 0, total = total + 1  Now, it is guaranteed that for each input file, the value of total as computed above will never exceed 500.   Example Input: 3 2 0 2 1 3 1  Output: 3 5 17 
 Finally the LazyProblemSetters have decided the way in which they will attempt the questions in the problem set. They have decided to go to the Computer Lab of the CSE department (because it has air-conditioning) and are ready to get their hands dirty with some WA's and TLE's.   Their department has a very unique lab. They have a lot of computers and each student gets a private account which they can access through any of those computers. For this, no data is stored on these computers but on dedicated servers and sent to the computer that a student is currently using. This way the students are not forced to sit on particular computers and can choose any place they like that is available.   Now, the department has a home built advanced facial recognition software which they use in this lab. It works as follows:When anyone sits on a computer, his/her picture is captured, (along with the locality) and sent to the internal database of the lab where they identify the user associated with that picture, and the computer he/she is sitting. After that the data of that user is fetched from the dedicated data servers and sent to the computer.   Now, all this takes time, and to keep the user busy, they decided to give them a puzzle to solve. If the user solves the puzzle correctly, they are allowed to login. The puzzle is as follows:    A string S (composed of only small case letters of the English alphabet) is shown on the screen to the user.  Then two integers P and Q are shown to the users.  The user has now to create a string R using S and P by concatenating P copies of S one after another. Then R is transformed into its smallest lexicographic permutation i.e. all the "a"'s are brought to the front and placed there, then after that all the "b"'s are placed, then "c"'s and so on. This is the final R that the user needs to form.  Then Q numbers appear on the screen one by one. For each number N that appears on the screen, the user has to type the character at the N^th location of R. If N is greater than the length of R, they have to type "-1" (without quotes).   Input The first line consists of an integer T, the number of test cases followed by the test cases themselves. Each test case begins with the string S in the first line, followed by two space-separated integers P and Q in the next line. Then Q lines follow, each containing an integer N.   Output For each test case, for each integer N, print in a new line the character at the N^th location of R  or print "-1" (without quotes) as described above.  Constraints   1 ≤ P ≤ 10^7  1 ≤ N ≤ 10^9  1 ≤ Q ≤ 10^5  1 ≤ |S| ≤ 100, where |S| denotes the length of the string.  1 ≤ T ≤ 10   Example  Input: 1 abcde 3 5 3 4 10 15 16  Output: a b d e -1  Note: Large I/O, be careful with certain languages 
As we all know that team LaZyProblemSetters is gearing up for ICPC 2015 and have finally reached in front of a computer together to solve a problem set. Since they have already wasted too much time procrastinating, they have decided to manage the problem set with more caution. They are now ordering the problems according to their difficulty levels instead of solving all the easy problems as they used to do earlier.   For this practice round, everybody has pitched in a few problems of their choice. So in the end, they have a set of N problems ordered as P1, ..., PN, where Pi denotes the i^th problem. For each problem that was brought in by any team member, he assigned an integer Di which according to him is the difficulty level of that problem.   The difficulty level assigned to a problem is exactly the number of time units one expects to solve that particular problem. However, as we all know, that assigning difficulty to a problem is really subjective and the assigned difficulty level of the problem may change when all the three team members look at that problem.

    Problem description. Abhishek is taking a girl from his office to a date but he lacks money. Unfortunately this is not the first time something like this has happened, and reason is obvious - Abhishek goes out on way too many dates. He makes up his mind to solve this problem just before the date starts and he starts planning for it. He wants a limit for the total expense on any date and tries to have the most possible fun with regard to this limit. Abhishek know beforehand the cost of each item on the menu and makes an estimate of how much his date would enjoy ordering each item. Write a program which finds the optimal set of menu items that offer the most enjoyment to Abhishek's date. Maximize their enjoyment, without crossing the budget. Needless to say but he wants to save money for other dates as well, so he wants to spend only the amount actually required and save as much as he can. Abhishek is lucky as he can always choose the menu items to order.  Input:  The first line of the input specifies your date budget and the number N of items on menu. The following N lines contain two numbers each. The first number indicates the cost of each item. Items cost between $5 and $25. The second number indicates the amount of enjoyment given by each item, given as an integer number ranging from 1 to 10(both inclusive). The budget will not exceed $500 and there will be at most 100 items. All numbers are separated by a single space. There are many test cases. Input ends with 0 0.   Output For each test case your program must output the total cost of all the items and the total enjoyment of an optimal solution. Both numbers must be separated by a single space.

 Problem description.  Dr. Aditi in The Department of Biological Sciences in BITS Pilani decides to do an experiment and find what mutation in the genes of mice can help reduce their speed of food consumption and also the gene responsible for the growth rate of mice. Since she is a genius she successfully finds the gene responsible for it. Now she has a task to create a mutation so as to decrease the food consumption rate. She creates one mutation each in various identical genes and needs to have various trials to find which mutations works. She now implants a single mutant gene in each mice. For conducting trials, she uses cupcakes that will determine the food consumption rates. If there are N types of mutations, what is the minimum number of cupcakes required to find the mutation that works correctly? Assume that all other mutations except one are useless and all mice except one eat cupcakes with the same speed and there is at least one mutation that will be successful. The same cupcake cannot be used more than once.  Input The first line contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The next T lines contains one integer N, the total number of mutations.  Output For each test case, output a single integer containing minimum number of cupcakes required.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤  100 1 ≤ N ≤  10^5   Example Input: 3 2 6 12  Output: 2 4 5    Explanation Example case 1. If there are 2 mutations, 1 in each mice, then both of them can be given a cupcake and the mice which eats less will be the correct mutation. Example case 2. If there are 6 mutations, then divide 6 mice in two groups of 3. Give each group a cupcake. The group which eats less cupcake i.e finishes later contains the mutant mice. Let's assume "abc" is that group. Now you will require only 2 more cupcakes to find the mutant mice. So total number of cupcakes required are 4. 
  Problem description. Little Schrodinger had a magical cat. That cat once fell down an empty well. As the walls of the well were not completely vertical, the cat could climb up the well. In one day, the cat can climb 1 unit height and the height of the well is h units. The cat starts at the bottom. Every day, a cat would divide into 2 cats. One of them would climb up 1 unit. The other would wait for help. But while waiting it would fall asleep and roll down 1 unit, unless it is already at the bottom, in which case it just remains there. When a cat would reach the top, it would run home to Schrodinger. (Schrodinger doesn't know that some of the cats are in a well and so he can't rescue them). It has been d days since the cat fell into the well. How many cats would come out of the well today? You would notice that the number of cats grows very large with each passing day, so output the answer modulo 10^9+7. NOTE : d = 0 means that the cat has fallen just now and so there's just one cat at the bottom of the well. So you wouldn't see any cat coming out today. If the height of the well is 1 unit, you will see a cat come out tomorrow.  Input The first line contains the number of test cases T. Each line of a test case contains the 2 integers h and d.  Output For each test case output the number of cats reaching Schrodinger modulo (10^9+7).  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤  1000 1 ≤ h ≤  10 0 ≤ d ≤  10^18     Example Input: 4 4 0 4 3 5 5 5 7  Output: 0 0 1 5

  It's not the rivers that you might be thinking about. The question revolves around the concept of digital rivers. A digital river is a sequence of numbers where the number following n is n plus the sum of its digits. FOR EXAMPLE  12345 is followed by 12360 since 1+2+3+4+5=15 and so   12345 + 15 gives 12360. similarly 145 is followed by 155.    If the unit's digit of a digital river is 'M' we will call it river 'M' .for example 231 would be called river 1.  river 480 is the sequence beginning {480,492,507,519....} river 483 is the sequence beginning   {483,498,519,....}.    normal streams and rivers can meet, and the same is true for digital rivers . This happens when two digital rivers share some of the same values. FOR EXAMPLE:  river 480 meets river 483 at 519. river 480 meets river 507 at 507 and never meets river 481.    Every digital river will eventually meet river 1,river 3 or river 9.   Write a program that can determine for a given integer n the value where river n first meets one of these three rivers.  Input   The input may contain multiple test cases. Each test case occupies a separate line and contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 16384). A test case with value of 0 for n terminates the input and this test case must not be processed.  Output  For each test case in the input first output the test case number(starting from 1)as shown in the sample output. Then on a separate line output the line "first meets river x at y".Here y is the lowest value where river n first meets river x (x= 1 or 3 or 9).If river n meets river x at y for more than one value of x,output the lowest value.print a blank line between two consecutive test cases.    Input:   86   12345   0    Output:   Case #1   first meets river 1 at 101    Case #2   first meets river 3 at 12423

Then, he moves to a square in the next row, collects the flowers, and so on until he reaches the last row. He can not go back to a previous row When he moves to the next row, he can only move to the square just below it or diagonally to the left or right. Help Romeo grab the maximum number of roses he can.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follow: The first line of each test case contains two integers H and W denoting the number of rows and columns respectively. H lines follow. Each line has W space separated integers A1, A2, ..., AW, where each integer M is the number of flowers in that square.  Output Output T lines, one for each test case. Each line should contain a single integer, which is the maximum possible number of flowers Romeo can get, for the corresponding test case.

 Romeo and Juliet are sending messages to each other. But to protect them from prying eyes, they have come up with a clever scheme to encrypt their messages. They have assigned a number to every possible combination of alphabets! It goes as follows: 1 = A 2 = B . . . 26 = Z 27 = AA 28 = AB . . . 702 = ZZ 703 = AAA and so on. Now you have to decrypt their message.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follow: Each test case contains a single integer N denoting the coded word.  Output For each test case, output a single string(upper case) which is the decoded word.  Constraints Should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have. Format it like:  1 <= T <= 1000 1 <= N <= 10^18   Example Input: 5 6 28 221629 4606000382677 62977  Output: F AB LOVE VALENTINE CODE  Problem Setter: Rohan Rawat 
  We all know that girls love gifts, right? Well, if you have been into programming, you must be knowing about Alice and Bob. Alice and Bob have been dating since a while and so it's very natural that they'll meet over a cup of coffee today, i.e. the Valentine's Day :D Bob is very confused as to what should he gift Alice today. He doesn't believe in giving expensive gifts (just like me :P), so he decides to give a custom selection of some fine dark chocolates which he plans to get gift wrapped along with a red rose. Sounds great!! :) A small problem has cropped up though. The problem is, when he visits the chocolate shop, the shopkeeper shows him many small dark chocolates placed in a M X N box. Bob is having a hard time figuring out the different types of chocolates available in the box because the shopkeeper doesn't have the exact information about their flavors. Though he can distinguish them on the basis of their shape, their flavors are not known to him because similarly shaped chocolates may have the same or different flavor. However, the shopkeeper does have some information in a weird format. He says that the chocolates which share an edge (which means they are adjacent to each other) have the same flavor. This implies that the box can have empty cells as well. Bob is curious as to how many different combinations of chocolates he can gift to Alice categorized on the basis of their flavors (and not shape)? Note: Two combinations are different from each other if there is at least one chocolate in one of the combinations which has a flavor which is not present in any of the chocolates in the other. See examples for better understanding.   Input The first line of the input consists of T, the no of test cases. The first line of each test case consists of two space separated integers M and N denoting the dimensions of the chocolate box. The next M lines consist of N characters denoting the contents of the cell: 'C' standing for a chocolate and 'E' standing for an an empty cell.    Output For each test case, output on a new line the total no of different combinations possible modulo 1000000007.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 1000 1 ≤ N, M ≤ 100     Example Input: 2 3 3 CEE ECE EEC 1 2 CC  Output: 7 1    Explanation Example case 1.There are three chocolates and all of these have different flavors. So, a total of 7 combinations are possible. Let the three chocolates be 1, 2 and 3 respectively.  Then the 7 combinations are (1), (2), (3), (1, 2), (1,3), (2, 3) and (1, 2, 3). Example case 2.Here both the chocolates have the same flavor. Hence, answer is 1 since only a single flavor is available. Problem Setter: Ayush Jaggi

Chef has gone out camping. One day while coming back to his tent he lost his way. While searching for the way back he encountered THREE SUPERNATURAL RIVERS,out of which only one can take him back to his tent. Each river has rocks besides it with numbers on it starting from 1,3 and 9 respectively. The next rock in the series has number as the previous number plus the sum of digits of previous number. eg for river with rock no. 1 as first rock the series will be: 1,1+1=2,2+2=4,4+4=8,8+8=16,16+1+6=23,23+2+3=28,... or 1,2,4,8,16,23,28,38,49..... or for river with rock no 3 as first rock: 3,3+3=6,6+6=12,12+1+2=15,15+1+5=21,21+2+1=24,24+2+4=30.... or 3,6,12,15,21,24,30,33,39,51... or the series for 29 will be: 29,29+2+9=40,40+4+0=44,44+4+4=52,52+5+2=59,59+5+9=73..... or 29,40,44,52,59,73.....  Chef also has a number in his mind. This number will help him to determine that which river he has to cross and from which rock. He has to cross at the roch number of the specific river where both the series of river and the series of the number he has thought have a number in common. eg. if has thought of the number 29, then he would have to cross river 1 at rock number 107.

Will, Elizabeth, Barbossa, and the entire crew of Black Pearl are set out to rescue Captain Jack Sparrow from Davy Jones's Locker. The escape map is a graph with N islands and M routes. Each route represents a bi-directional way from one island to another. The N islands are numbered from 1 to N. With each route associated is end-points (Ai,Bi) and the length of the route Ci. Since Davy Jones have left some of his servants at each island, there is some danger level associated with each island Dj. The crew wants to escape out of the locker of davy jones alive. They need to go from Davy Jone's island to their home following the given routes. As a matter of fact, their ship Black Pearl have only K units of fuel left in it. Black Pearl travels 1 unit with 1 unit of fuel. You need to tell Jack the minimum danger level with which the crew can escape to determine their chances of survival. If it is impossible to escape, the entire crew is doomed and you should print -1. The danger level of a path is defined as the maximum of danger level out of all the nodes present in that particular path.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case would contain two integers, N and K. The following line would contain N integers separated by a single space representing Dj, the danger level of each island. The next line would contain three integers, M, X and Y, representing the number of edges, Davy Jones island and Jack's home respectively.

Jack and Angelica are in search of fountain of youth and up ahead is the valley of death. Although they could go around the valley, Blackbeard wants to get the chalices before the Spanish so he forces one of them to go through the valley. To decide who would travel through the valley, Jack and Angelica play a game of stones. The game starts with P piles of stones. The i^th pile contains Ni number of stones. The players play the game taking chances alternatively where Jack starts first. In each move, the player whose turn it is has to remove at least one coin from any single pile and ofcourse not more than the number of coins present in that particular pile. The number of coins which can be removed in one move is defined as a special series for each pile by the Blackbeard. Only the numbers that appear anywhere in the special series of that pile can be removed in one move from that pile. The special series is: F[i] = F[i-1] + F[i-2], for i ≥ 2 F[0] = 1 and F[1] = Mi , where Mi is given for each pile Stating simply, only those number of coins can be removed from a pile if it satisfies F[i] for any i ≥ 0 for the special series of that pile. The player who cannot make a move loses and is forced to jump into the valley of death. You need to tell who would survive if they both always play optimally.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains one integer, P. The next P lines contain two integers, Ni and Mi denoting the number of stones and F[1] of the special series of that pile respectively.  Output For each test case, print "Jack" if Jack wins else print "Angelica".  Constraints:  1 <= T <= 10 1 <= P <= 100 1 <= Ni <= 10000 1 <= Mi <= 10000   Example Input 2 2 4 3 5 2 2 5 3 5 3 Output Jack Angelica  Explanation  In the first test case, the players can remove either 1,3,4.. and so on from pile one and either 1,2,3.. from pile two. If now both play optimally, Jack wins. 
Barbossa after a long search has found the island on which the dead man's chest is located. To open the chest, Barbossa has to solve the mystery of the chest. Barbossa knowing the only programmer you, needs your help to solve the mystery. You are given N distinct digits and a string S. A number is mysterious if it contains all the N given digits atleast once and other digits may or may not come. Leading zeroes are never considered. The mysterious number also must not have the given string S as a substring of the number.  For example, If 1, 2 and 3 are the digits given and 23 is the string given, then 12 is not a mysterious number since it does not have 3 in it, 123 is not a valid mysterious number since 23 is a substring of the number, whereas 132 and 11324 are mysterious numbers. You need to solve the mystery by calculating the total number of mysterious numbers between [L,R] and the sum of all the mysterious numbers between [L,R] for some queries of L and R.  Input: The first line of the input contains an integer N denoting the number of digits. The description of N distinct digits follows in the next line as space separated integers. The third line contains the string S. The next line contains only one integer Q denoting the number of queries. The following Q lines denote each query containing two integers L and R.  Output: For each query, print in the format "A B" where A is the total number of mysterious numbers mod 100003 in the range and B is the sum of all the lucky numbers mod 100003 in the range.  Constraints:  1 <= N <= 10 1 <= length of String S <= 20 1 <= Q <= 5 1 <= L <= R <= 10^18 N will be all distinct   Example Input:  2 1 2 21 2 1 15 20 99 Output  1 12 0 0 
Pintel is a pirate and former Black Pearl crew member under Captain Barbossa. He was imprisoned after the Aztec curse was broken, but somehow escaped from there. Ragetti is Pintel's inseparable crew mate. He has a wooden eye, and despite being illiterate, has begun "reading" the Bible, with the excuse that "you get credit for trying."  Pintel and Ragetti are best friends, but their opinions differ in every thing. They like giving challenges to each other and to prove the other one wrong. One day Pintel gave Ragetti N numbers. Ragetti is highly optimistic so he likes positive numbers but Pintel, on the opposite, likes negative numbers. After getting the N numbers Ragetti can multiply any range [L, R] (1 <= L <= R <= N) by the number -1 atmost once so that sum of all the N numbers is maximum after the above operation is applied. Ragetti is weak in maths and programming. So, he needs your help as you are the only programmer among the crew members.   Input The first line contains the number of test cases T. The next lines give the description of the T test cases. The first line of the each test case contains the number of elements N. The second line contains all the N elements Pintel gave to Ragetti. (n1, n2, n3 ...)  Output The T lines of output would contain the maximum sum that could be created by Ragetti for each test case.  Constraints  1 <= T <= 10 1 <= N <= 100000 -100000 <= ni <= 100000   Example Input  2 5 1 2 3 4 5 5 -2 3 -1 -4 -2 Output  15 8 
The Flying Dutchman is a giant ship and the dock has many types of tasks which have to be done to keep the ship functional. Every crew member have their own taste in the kind of tasks that they find interesting. Davy Jones has published a list of tasks that he currently has and needs to be finished. Every crew member gives his preference as a list of tasks that he/she is interested to work on. Davy jones has N tasks to finish and N crew members working for him. All the N tasks are estimated to take exactly the same amount of time, so Jones has planned to assign one task to each crew member and every task is assigned to exactly one crew member. Jones is also a very understanding captain, so he wants to assign tasks to his team respecting everyone's preferences. You are the "Crew Chief" working for Jones, and are required to help him in doing the task assignment. Here are the questions that Jones wants you to answer:  1) Check if it is possible to assign all the tasks to his crew, respecting their preferences. 2) Count the number of (c, t) pairs, such that there is a way to assign all the tasks when crew member 'c' is assigned task 't'.  Input  The first line contains the number of test cases T. The next lines give the description of the T test cases. The first line of the each test case contains the number of tasks (same as number of crew members) N. The second line of the test case contains preferences of 1st crew member, 3rd line of the test case contains preferences of 2nd crew member .. and so on.. n+1^th line of the test cases contains preferences of n^th crew member. The preference of an engineer is specified as follows: number of tasks that the crew member is interested in 'k', followed by 'k' integers representing the unique id of the tasks that the crew member prefers.  Output You need to output T lines, with one line of output for each test case. The output of each test case should be of the form "X Y", where,X is 1 if it is possible to assign all the tasks, and 0 otherwise. Y is the number of (c, t) pairs such that there is a way to assign all the tasks such that crew member 'c' is assigned task 't'.  Constraints  1 <=T <= 50 2 <= N <= 100 1 <= k <= 100 1 <= task_id <= N   Example Input 2 4 2 1 2 2 2 3 2 2 3 2 3 4 4 2 1 2 3 2 3 4 1 3 1 3 Output 1 6 0 0 
  Its a fine Sunday in Dholakpur and our friends Bheem, Chhutki, Jaggu and Raju are playing tug of wars with Kalia and his team. Meanwhile their play they got tired and hence needed a break, Bheem  got hungry and we all know what he wants.... Yes you guessed it right, his all time favourite laddus. So, Chhutki offered him laddus, meanwhile Kalia noticed that the laddus where not spherical as they used to be but this time they were in the form of English alphabets. Kalia as we know is cunning got some idea to have those laddus from Bheem, and hence challenged Bheem for a game called “Game of Anagrams”. The challenge given to Bheem was to find all the different anagrams of the given laddus which we know are in the shape of English alphabets (A-Z and a-z) that can be generated with the help of the laddus taken k at a time. Assume all the laddus are of different shapes, help Bheem to win the Game of Anagrams.    Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.  Next T lines contains 2 space-separated integers  N  and k where N denotes the number of laddus given by Kalia to Bheem in a challenge and k denotes the number of laddus to be taken at a time for generating anagrams.     Output  For each test case, output a single line containing number of anagrams formed by taking k letters at a time.  Since the number can be very large print your answer modulo (10^9+7)     Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 50 1 ≤ N ≤ 52 1 ≤ k ≤ N     Example Input: 2 7 5 5 1  Output: 2520 5 
  Bheem and his friends were playing with numbers in the jungle but suddenly there came a storm, all the trees started displacing from their places, animals running here and there to survive the storm. Yes it was Kirmada back again to conquer Dholakpur, the only kingdom left in the world that was not conquered by him. He challenged Bheem again to save Dholakpur as this time Kirmada was even stronger than earlier, but this time the challenge was not to fight against him to save Dholakpur but the challenge was with numbers. With his magical power Kirmada concatenated all the number from  1  to N and gave Bheem a number  k  and challenged him to tell the digit at k^th index in the concatenated number. Help Bheem win this challenge and save Dholakpur.    Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.   Next T contains 2 space-separated integers N and k     Output  For each test case, output a single line containing the k^th digit (1-based indexing) in the concatenated number.      Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100000 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^15 1 ≤ k ≤ the length of concatenated number     Example Input: 2 10 5 15 16  Output: 5 1    Explanation Example case 1. concatenating all numbers from 1 to 10 gives 1234567810 and the 5th digit in the concatenated number is 5.  Example case 2. concatenating all numbers from 1 to 15 gives 123456789101112131415 and the 16th digit in the concatenated number is 1.  Note: The problem originally belongs to one of the Google Interview Questions. 
  We all know that our friend Bheem likes gcd of numbers very much. One day Kaalia challenged him with a new problem with gcd. He gave Bheem N numbers and asked to divide the given set of numbers into some disjoint subsequences. Two numbers a and b belong to same subsequence if  gcd(a,b)>1. Value of each subsequence is the largest number in that subsequence. He challenged Bheem to find the product of values of all subsequences. Help Bheem win this challenge.  Note: if gcd(a,b) >1, gcd (b,c) >1 then a,b,c will be in same subsequence even if gcd(a,c) = 1.     Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of elements in the set.  The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN elements in the set.     Output  For each test case output a single number, the answer to given problem modulo 1000000007, in a separate line.     Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ N ≤ 200 1 ≤ Ai ≤ 10^9     Example Input: 2 4 2 4 3 9 3 2 3 6  Output: 36 6   
  Recently Bheem and their friends studied well known fibonacci sequence in their school. Afibonacci sequence is generated by the recursive formula: F[n]=F[n-1]+F[n-2] where n>1 and F[0]=F[1]=1. Then Bheem started playing with similar type of sequences. In this process he came up with generalized tetranacci numbers.Generalized tetranacci numbers are defined by following recurrence relation: T[n] = a*T[n-1] + b*T[n-2] + c*T[n-3] + d*T[n-4] +e  (n>4) where  T[1], T[2], T[3] and T[4] can be any given integer.  Bheem tried to calculate the value of this sequence upto a given number n, but he was unable to calculate the value of n^th term instantly.Given the values of n, a, b, c, d, e, T[1], T[2], T[3] and T[4]. Help Bheem calculate the value of T[n]. As the answer can be very large, output the answer modulo 1000000007.  Note: The answer should always be a positive integer.     Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows The first line of each test case contains a single integer n.  The second line of each test cases contains 9 separated integers a, b, c, d, e, T[1], T[2], T[3] and T[4].     Output  For each test case, output a single line containing the answer to given problem modulo 1000000007     Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 1000 5 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 -10^9 ≤ a, b, c, d, e, T[1], T[2], T[3] and T[4] ≤ 10^9     Example Input: 1 5 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 Output: 5   
  Due to do his good deeds, Krishna asked Bheem for a wish. As we know our friend Bheem likes laddus very much so he wished that he wanted to be in a world full of tasty laddus. So, Krishna with his magic sent Bheem to a magical world full of laddus. In this magical world even laddus where magical. There Bheem found that enery that he can gain eating some of the laddus increases every day and those special laddus were placed in a N x M  rectangular grid, each cell E[i][j] (1 <= i <= N , 1 <= j <= M ) containing one special laddu eating which at d^th day gives enery equal to d * E[i][j] where E[i][j] is the enery of laddu in the cell (i,j) that can be gained by eating on day 1. Each day Bheem can only eat all laddus of leftmost column, rightmost column, topmost row or bottommost row of the grid. Help Bheem maximize the overall enery gained by eating the laddus if he starts eating them on day 1.    Input  First line of each test case contains two space separated integers N and M. Then N lines follows, each of which contains M space separated integers representing the initial eanery that can be gained by eating the laddus.     Output   For each test case output a single number denoting the maximum enery that can be gained by eating the laddus.      Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 50 1 ≤ N,M ≤ 32 1 ≤ E[i][j] ≤ 10^9     Example Input: 1 2 2 1 2 3 4 Output: 21   Explanation Example case 1. Initially the grid representing the laddus is : {{1,2},{3,4}}. Bheem will gain optimal energy, when he will eat the laddus in following order. On 1st day Bheem eats all laddus of 1st row (topmost row). Energy gained by Bheem on 1st day = 1+2 = 3 The resultant grid becomes {{3,4}}. On 2nd day Bheem eats all laddus of 1st column (leftmost column). Energy gained by Bheem on 2nd day = 2*3 = 6. The resultant grid becomes {{4}} (there is only 1 element). On 3rd day Bheem eats the only laddu. Energy gained by Bheem on 3rd day = 3*4 = 12. Therefore, the total energy gained by Bheem after eating all the laddus = 3 + 6 + 12 = 21.  
Chef Polo is experimenting with Prime Numbers. He can quickly tell whether a number is prime or not. His friend Palin knows about it, so he twists the question. Palin challenges his friend to check whether a number P is "almost prime" or not. The number P is said to be almost prime if it has exactly 3 distinct divisors.

  Rahul and Jupiter are playing a new game called Alien Numbers. They defined L as the length of a given number when the number is in base 10(decimal). Now they are finding new methods to determine numbers which are Alien in a given range. A number N with L ≥ 1 is considered to be alien iff:   N is divisible by L,   N/L is alien recursively,  Since this task contains very large range of numbers and Jupiter needs to return to his planet, therefore they need your help in finding how many numbers are there in a interval X and Y (both inclusive).    Input First line of input contains T, the number of testcases. Next T lines contains two integers X and Y defining the range.    Output For each case output a single integer denoting the number of Alien Numbers between X and Y.    Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 200 0 ≤ X ≤ 10^18 0 ≤ Y ≤ 10^18     Example Input: 2 7 25 45 50  Output: 10 1    Explanation Example case 2 : Only 48 satisfies the given properties.

Dr.Zero lives in Treeland. Tree land consists of a tree with N nodes connected by N-1 weighted undirected edges. The nodes of the tree are numbered from 1 to N. The tree is rooted at node 1.   Dr. Zero wanted to create a super amazing experiment. Before starting the experiment, he has laid out few important definitions needed.    A subtree rooted at node x is defined recursively. It contains node x and the nodes in the subtrees of its children nodes. The strategic cost of a node in the subtree is defined as the distance to the farthest node from it in the whole subtree. The strategic cost of a subtree is defined by the minimum of strategic cost of all the nodes in the subtree.   In the experiment, he found strategic cost of subtree of each node in the tree. Sadly, he has misplaced the paper containing those results and now seeks your help.   Input  The first line of input contains one integer T, the number of test cases. For each test case: the first line contains N, the number of nodes. In the next N-1 lines, each line contains 3 integers u,v,w which indicates an edge between node u and v with length w.   Output For each test case, output N lines, i-th of those should contain an integer corresponding to the strategic cost of subtree rooted at vertex i.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 50 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^4   Example Input: 1 6 1 2 5 1 5 6 2 3 2 2 4 1 3 6 1 Output: 8 3 1 0 0 0  Explanation  The cost of the tree rooted at vertex 1 is 8, because the vertex with the minimum strategic cost is 1 and the farthest vertex from it 6 with distance 8. The cost of the tree rooted at vertex 2 is 3, here both vertices 2 and 3 have minimum strategic cost; the farthest vertex from 3 is 4 with distance 3 and the farthest vertex from 2 is 6 with distance 3 as well. In the tree rooted at 3, both 3 and 6 have minimum strategic cost. The rest of the trees are single-node trees because they're rooted at leaves.  
 Today is Chota Mouse's birthday. He wants to celebrate it in a grand style. His brother Mota Chuha immediately contacted a nearby bakery for an online delivery of a cake. The cake is of rectangular shape with height H and width W. Chota Mouse has invited F of his friends to the party. So, he wants to make F vertical cuts at distinct positions on the cake, so that the cake will be divided into F + 1 non-zero area parts (F for his friends and one for himself).   Let us assume the cake is placed along the coordinate axis with its left end at x coordinate 0 and right end at W. Please see the image in the examples for details. He will make cuts at positions Pi such that Pi is strictly greater than zero and strictly less than W. Also note that, all the positions for cutting are distinct.   Chota Mouse is a nice guy. So, he will be keeping the piece with the least area for himself and leave the other pieces for his friends to enjoy. Chota Mouse is weak in mathematics, so can you please help him figure out the area of the piece he is going to have?  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. First line of each test case contains three space separated integers F, H, W. Second line of each test case contains F space separated integers, i-th of them denotes Pi. Output For each test case, print a single integer corresponding to the answer of the problem. Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ F ≤ 500 1 ≤ H ≤ 10000 F + 1 ≤ W ≤ 10000 1 ≤ Pi ≤ W - 1  Sample  Input  3 1 1 2 1 1 4 5 3 2 3 9 6 2  Output  1 8 6  Explanation In the first example, both the pieces have same area (i.e. = 1).   In the second example, there are two pieces. First piece has an area of 12, second has an area of 8. So, the answer will be 8.   In the third example, there are three pieces. First piece has an area of 6, second 12, and third 9. So, the answer will be 6.

But he is not very sure if he correctly solved it. Can you help him in verifying the answer.     The problem looks like:       There is a grid of size N x M, there are C unit radii circles with integer center coordinates ((x0,y0), (x1,y1) .... (xc-1, yc-1)) on the grid. Choose any square portion of that grid with side length A such that the sides of the square are parallel to the sides of grid, corners of this square must be inside or on the boundary of the grid and their coordinates are integers. Find the expected area covered by circles inside that square if you were to choose such a square randomly on the grid. Answer must be correct upto 6 places of decimal.  Input     First line will contain N, M, A, and C i.e number of rows, number of columns, side of the square and total number of cirlces respectively. Next C lines contains coordinates of center of circles. Output     One line containing expected area covered by circles correct upto 6 places of decimal.

Case 2: These are 4 possible ways to choose a square with side length 2 and two of them will contain one quadrant of a circle each.   
  COINS       Our Farzi Coder likes Mota Chuha a lot, as he runs very fast and catching him is not only hard, but also impossible.       The city is in the form of a tree (Graph Theory Tree), with N junctions with exactly one follower of Farzi Coder in each. There are N-1 bidirectional roads connecting these junctions such that there is exactly one distinct path between any pair of junctions.       Now Farzi Coder decides to distribute some of his illegal wealth among his followers so as to maintain their loyalty and wants Mota Chuha to do this task for him. In between the process of distribution, Farzi Coder would also ask Mota Chuha some questions, to check if he is really distributing the coins correctly or not.       Now for the next Q days, on each day, he assigns exactly one of the following two tasks to the Mota Chuha:  Give(X,Y,W) => Give one W rupee coin to all followers along the path in the tree between the followers X and Y (including X and Y). Find(Z, I, J, K) => Find the K'th smallest coin among all the coins present in the hands of follower Z which were distributed between I'th and J'th day (including I'th and J'th Days). If Z has less than K coins, then report -1. It is guaranteed that J will be less than the current day number.   Mota Chuha is too lazy to distribute the wealth. But he has to answer the Find() tasks. He knows that ICPC participants are very smart and can simulate the Update() tasks through a program and can answer the Find() tasks very fast. So please help him, he might give some of the coins to you.   		Note that a person can hold multiple coins of same value. Let us say, person Z has P coins with him which were distributed between I'th and J'th Days, i.e, Coin[1], Coin[2]...C[P]. Sort the array Coin[1...P]. Now, K'th smallest coin is Coin[K].   		Example: If person Z has coins {1, 2, 3, 3, 4}. Then, 2nd smallest coin is 2, 3rd smallest coin is 3, 4th smallest coin is 3, 5th smallest coin is 4.   Note:Number of Update tasks will be less 51% of the total tasks. The memory limit of the problem will be 1.5 GB.  Input  	The first line contains one integer N, size of the tree.   	Next N-1 lines contain two space separated integers "X Y" (without quotes) each, representing that there is an edge between the nodes (X, Y).   	Next line contains an integer Q.   	Next Q lines contains the tasks given to Mota Chuha. If the first integer in the line is 1, then it is followed by three integers space separated integers "X Y W" (without quotes) denoting the first type of task. Else if the first integer in the line is 2, then it is followed by 4 space separated integers "Z I J K" (without quotes) denoting the second type of task.  Output     For each task of type 2, output the required answer.

Chef has a problem with the new city he has invented. The city has N buildings and there are bridges which connect some pair of buildings in such a way that there is exactly one path between any pair of buildings. (i.e. They form a tree). All bridges are of equal length. Distance between two buildings is the sum of lengths all bridges connecting the two buildings. Now chef wants to find for each building i, the number of buildings that are farthest from it.  Input format  First line contains an integer N.  Next N - 1 lines contains 2 integers each. i+1^th line contains ui and vi which means that there is a bridge between  ui and vi   Output format  Print N integers seperated by a space in a single line denoting the answer for each building  Constraints   2 ≤ N ≤ 10^5  0 ≤ ui , vi &lt N for all i from 1 to N - 1    Example  Input 4 0 1 1 2 1 3  Output 2 3 2 2   Explanation 2 and 3 are farthest from 0 (both at a distance of 2 bridges). So there are 2 of them and hence first number is 2. 0,2 and 3 are farthest from 1. So the next number is 3. Similarly for 2 and 3. 
 After attending Amrita summer training camp, N programmers, getting bored of programming, decided to have a car race. Each of them bring their own car to the race. As the camp also includes school children, to level the playing field, some of the coders are allowed to have a head start. The i^th programmer starts his race at a distance Di ahead of the starting line at time T = 0. The speed of the car of the i^th coder is equal to Si. After time T, the position of i^th coder will be Pi(T) = Si * T + Di. Let's define f(T) = max(Pi(T)) - min(Pj(T)). The race ends at time T = K. You need to find the minimum value of f(T) during the whole race.  Input The first line of the input contains two integers N and K denoting the number of coders and the duration of the race. The next N lines contains two integers each, i^th line contains Si and Di.  Output Output the minimum value of f(T) during the whole race exactly upto 6 places after the decimal point.  Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ Si ≤ 10^5 0 ≤ Di ≤ 10^5   Example  Input:  2 10 20 0 10 10  Output:  0.000000   Explanation At t = 1 sec, both the coders will have same position, which makes f(1) = 0.

Chef's great great grand child has found a way to send messages back in time to him to tell the coordinates of a place where chef can find treasure. His evil twin brother has also found a way to send messages back in time and he too sends the coordinates of a place to chef. But this place, instead of containing a treasure actually contains a witch who kills whoever she meets. Chef sees that he has recieved two messages and becomes suspicious. He decides to find the manhattan distance between these two points. If this value is greater than a certain value D then he decides not to visit any of the two places since there is a high chance that there might be danger in one of the places. If it is less than or equal to D then he decides to visit the midpoint of the two coordinates in the hope that he can actually see which place contains the treasure from there. The messages are encoded as a string and sent by the brothers as string S1 and S2 respectively. You can convert the string into the 26 dimensional coordinate by doing the following. The first coordinate is the number of times the character 'a' occurs, the second coordinate is the number of times the character 'b' occurs, and so on and the 26th coordinate is the number of times the character 'z' occurs. All the characters of the string will be lowercase alphabets.  You can read about manhattan distance here: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Manhattan_distance  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The next T lines contains two strings and an integer separated by a space S1 and S2 and D.  Output For each test case print "YES" (without quotes) if chef decides to visit the midpoint of the two coordinates, else print "NO" (without quotes), in a separate line.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10^2 1 ≤ |S1| ≤ 10^2 1 ≤ |S2| ≤ 10^2 1 ≤ D ≤ 10^2   Example  Input:  2 ab ab 2 ab cd 1  Output:  YES NO 
It was a lovely evening in Morocco so Sundar decided to take his girlfriend out for a ride in his new car. They started from his house and decided to go to the outskirts of the city. The only problem was that his car was a sports car and so it had very low mileage. In order to overcome this he decides to refill his tank in the petrol bunks that are present along his route. He doesn't want to get embarrassed in front of his girlfriend, so he takes just enough money that he needs to pay at the petrol bunks such that he can reach his destination. He is travelling from the point (0, 0) to the point (L, 0) along the x-axis. There are n petrol bunks along the path at positions given by Xi such that 0 < Xi < L. To refill at the i^th station he has to pay a cost Ci. He can only refill his tank fully at each station. His car has a mileage of D, meaning it can cover a distance D after completely refilling, after which it becomes empty. You need to print the minimum money that Sundar would have taken with himself for the ride. Initially assume he has a full tank.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The first line corresponding to each test case contains three integers N, L and D denoting the number of petrol bunks, the distance he needs to travel to reach his destination and the mileage of Sundar's car. The next N lines contains two integers each, i^th line contains Xi and Ci.  Output For each test case print "NO" if it is impossible to reach the destination. If it is possible print "YES" and print the minimum amount Sundar would have taken with him for the ride, both in the same line separated by a space.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9 1 ≤ D ≤ 10^9 1 ≤ Xi < L 1 ≤ Ci ≤ 10^4   Example  Input:  2 7 20 5 2 5 3 6 7 2 10 4 12 3 16 2 19 1 4 8 3 2 4 1 2 4 5 3 2  Output:  YES 12 NO  Explanation In the first case Sundar can refuel his car at petrol bunk's present at positions 2, 7, 12, 16 and reach the destination at position 20. Hence the cost of refuelling is 5 + 2 + 3 + 2 = 12. Note that the distance between any two consecutive petrol bunks is not more than the mileage of the Sundar's car. In the second case, the farthest petrol bunk from starting point is present at position Xi = 4, if he refuels at this petrol bunk, he can only go till X = 4 + 3 = 7. But his destination is at X = 8, hence it is impossible for Sundar to reach his destination. 
 Farzi Coder has been assigned an important coding assignment by his boss Programmer Bhai. Now, Farzi Coder has done coding his project and has to submit it to a central git repository.     In git, before committing we have to add the files which we want to commit to the stage. We can add (stage) or remove (unstage) files to/from the stage. Initially the stage is empty. Programmer Bhai is very particular about what goes into the repository and what doesn't. He has given a list of files alongwith whether he wants the file in the stage or not.     e.g.      stage /code/lib/acpp     stage /code/lib/bcpp     unstage /code/lib/aout      This means we want /code/lib/acpp and /code/lib/bcpp to be in the stage while /code/lib/aout should not be in the stage.     There are 2 git commands to control staging:     git add <path>     git remove <path>      The path here can be a path to a file or a path to a directory. If the path is to a directory, the command applies to all the files and subdirectories inside that directory recursively.  Farzi Coder wants to commit the code asap.     What is the minimum number of git commands needed to add all the required files to stage while making sure none of the unstage files are in the stage. Input     The first line of the input has the number T denoting the number of test cases.      The first line of each test case has the number N denoting the number of files in this case.      Each of the next N lines contains a word denoting whether the following file should be on the stage or not followed by the path to the file.      i.e. the 2 types of input will be stage <path> and unstage <path>. Output      For each test case, output the number of minimum git commands needed.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ N ≤ 100 The length of each path doesn't exceed 100 Each path is a valid path to a file. Each path input follows these rules:  It doesn't end with a forward slash (/) Each path starts from the root directory (/) There are no two consecutive forward slashes Each file or directory name consists only of lowercase alphabets All paths in a test case are distinct There will be no file - directory conflict. e.g. consider /a/b/c and /a/b. Here b is both a file and a directory.   Sample  Input 3 3 stage /code/lib/acpp stage /code/lib/bcpp unstage /code/lib/aout 2 unstage /code/lib/acpp unstage /code/lib/bcpp 3 stage /code/lib/acpp stage /code/lib/bcpp stage /code/lib/aout  Output 2 0 1  Explanation  Case 1: The following 2 commands are enough:     git add /     git remove /code/lib/aout         The first command adds the entire project to the stage while the second command removes aout from the stage as required.  Case 2: As initially there are no files in the stage, no commands are necassary.  Case 3: We add all the files to stage using git add / or git add /code/lib/ 
!doctype>       Our well known coding mafia went to the city. Farzi Coder is the boss here. He hired a new member named Lambu Keyboard in his gang. Farzi Coder is so smart (at least that's what he thinks), so he wants to test Lambu Keyboard's programming skills. He gave him this task:    There are n buildings (numbered from left to right) with heights H1, H2...Hn. You can start jumping from any building.      The rules of jumping are:    You can only jump to a building with lesser height than the height of the current building.  In first turn you can jump either way, and 2^nd jump will be in the opposite direction of previous jump and must end in between current index and previous index, i.e if we start jumping from building 5, initially we can jump in either direction. Let's say we jump to building 8, then in next jump we can only jump in left direction and only on buildings with indices 6, 7. Let's say we jump to building 6, then next time we can only jump in right direction and between 6 and 8 i.e to 7.        We need to find the maximum number of jumps he can make, considering every building as the starting point. Input   First line contains an integer n i.e. the number of buildings.     Second line contains n space separated integers denoting heights of buildings from 1 to n. Output   One line containing n integers, the i^th integer will denote the maximum possible number of jumps starting from i^th building. Constraints  1 ≤ n ≤ 5000 1 ≤ H1, H2 ... Hn ≤ 10000  Sample  Input 5 1 3 4 2 5  Output 0 1 1 1 2  Explanation   If starting building is with height 1 then you can't jump to any other building.   If starting building is with height 3 then you can jump either to building with height 2 on right or with height 1 on left. But there will be at most one jump.   If starting building is with height 5 then one possible optimal sequence is to jump to building with height 3 then to building with height 2. So maximum number of jumps is 2.   
 Farzi Coder wants to give a nice Christmas present to his brother. For that he has brought N pairs of letters where each letter is either 'a' or 'b'. So, the possible pairs are "aa", "ab", "ba" or "bb". Now, Farzi Coder's brother loves palindromes. So, he decided to concatenate some of the pairs (possibly all or none) and form a palindrome. He wants the longest such palindrome possible. If there are multiple such longest palindromes possible, he wants to give his brother the lexicographically smallest palindrome among them as the gift. Since he is, well, Farzi Coder, you have to help him build the gift. Input     The first line of the input has the number T denoting the number of test cases.      The first line of each test case has the number N denoting the number of pairs  in this case.      Each of the next N lines contain a pair of characters which are either aa, ab, ba or bb. Output     For each test case, output on a seperate line the gift that Farzi Coder has to build. Note that the empty string is a palindrome. Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 500 1 ≤ N ≤ 2000 Each pair can be either aa, ab, ba or bb   Sample  Input 2 4 aa aa bb bb 3 ab ba ab  Output aabbbbaa abba   Explanation  Case 1: The following palindromes are possible: "aa", "aaaa", "bb", "bbbb", "aabbaa", "bbaabb", "aabbbbaa", "bbaaaabb". Of these, "aabbbbaa" and "bbaaaabb" are of the maximum length. Among these two, "aabbbbaa" is the lexicographically smallest.  Case 2: The palindromes possible here are: "baab" and "abba".   
Australia and New Zealand have started working on preparation for the World Cup 2015. There are N important venues (like hotels and stadiums) in the city. Out of these important venues, there is one central location where the opening and closing ceremony will be held. There is an existing network of bidirectional roads connecting these venues. The organizing committee has planned to decorate some of these roads that will be used for commuting. They have decided to choose the roads to decorate such that there is exactly one decorated path to all the venues from the central location. New Zealand is supposed to decorate these roads and Australia has taken up the responsibility of providing transportation. Only decorated roads can be used for transportation. Australia wanted to save fuel costs, and so they wanted to choose the decorated roads to minimize the total sum of distances to all venues from the central location. However, New Zealand had their own plans to minimize decoration cost by choosing the decorated roads such that the sum of the length of the chosen roads will be minimized. To prevent a fight breaking out between these two rivals before they even step on to the field, you have to help them by reporting if there is a solution in which the two rivals could choose the same set of roads while satisfying their respective constraints. Input: The first line contains the number of test cases T. For each test first line contains N and M which are number of venues and total number of roads respectively. Then next M lines for each case contains u, v and w - indicating that there is a bidirectional road of distance w between locations u and v. The central location is identified with location 0. Output: For each test case, output the required answer on a separate line. If there is a valid plan, then print “YES”. Else, print “NO” (quotes for clarity). Note: If any of the venues is not reachable from the central location, then print “NO”. Constraints: 1 <= T <= 10000 1 <= N <= 20000 0 <= M <= 40000 0 <= u < N 0 <= v < N u != v 1 <= w <= 10^9 The sum of values of N over all test cases will not be more than 1000000. The sum of values of M over all test cases will not be more than 2000000.   Example: Sample Input: 3 3 3 0 1 1 0 2 2 1 2 2 3 1 0 1 1 4 5 2 1 9 3 2 5 0 3 9 0 1 2 3 1 9   Sample Output: YES NO NO   Explanation: For the first case, both of them can choose the roads {0<-->1, 0<-->2}. For the second case, venue 2 is not reachable from the central location 0.   
The Indian team is known for their strong batting and sloppy bowling. The captain M.S. Dhoni is concerned about this issue. He wants to address this by pairing up bowlers who have good economy rates. He has all the bowlers' economy rates as integers. Unfortunately, these are T20 figures and to convert them to ODI format, he wants to pair up bowlers in such a way that the sum of the economy rates of two bowlers, modulo M, is always less than or equal to X. Given the economy rates, M and X, can you tell him how many such ordered pairs are possible? Note: The pair of bowlers chosen by him can be the same. Yeah, Dhoni has won a cup in all limited over formats, but he definitely needs to sharpen his math skills. Input: The first line contains the number of test cases T. Each test case contains N, M and X on the first line, followed by N space separated integers A[1..N] on the second line. Output: Output T lines, containing the answer for the corresponding test case. Constraints: 1 <= T <= 10 1 <= N <= 100000 0 <= X < M <= 100000 0 <= A[i] <= 1000000000 Sample Input: 2 3 5 3 1 2 3 4 7 4 31 12 11 17 Sample Output: 6 12 Explanation: For the first example, the valid pairs are (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3).     
The Cricket World Cup 2015 is nearing and it will be held in Australia and New Zealand. The organizing committee is planning to give a welcome gift to each team member. After careful thought and planning, they have decided on Matryoshka dolls.  A Matryoshka doll refers to a set of wooden dolls of strictly decreasing size, placed one inside the other. Any doll can contain only one doll directly inside it. Given the sizes of N dolls, output "YES" if it is possible to nest them all and have one doll on the outside and "NO" otherwise. Input - The input starts with T denoting the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains N, which is the total number of dolls. The second line contains N space separated integers denoting the size of the dolls. Output -  Print “YES” if the dolls can be nested inside each other and “NO” otherwise. (quotes for clarity) Constraints - 1 <= T <= 100 1 <= N <= 100 1 <= doll size <= 1000 Sample Input -  3 3 3 1 1 2  1 2 4 10 2 5 3   Sample Output - NO YES YES Explanation - For the first case, there are 2 dolls of size 1 and hence cannot be nested inside each other. For the second case, the doll with size 1 can be put inside the doll with size 2. 
The New Zealand government is super-excited about the Cricket World Cup 2015 happening in their country. Hence, it has decided to conduct a census on cricket to find out how many people are interested in the sport, etc. The statistics obtained are given to us as a range of numbers from A to B (inclusive). In these statistics, the government is interested in some particular numbers called "Kiwi Numbers". A number is called a Kiwi Number if it has a prime number of distinct factors. A prime number N has exactly two divisors, 1 and N. Can you help the government by calculating the number of Kiwi numbers in the given range?  Input: The first line contains the number of test cases T. Each of the next T lines contains two space separated numbers A and B. Output: For each test case, output the required answer on a separate line. Constaints: 1 <= T <= 100 2 <= A <= B <= 1000000000 B - A <= 200000 Sample Input: 3 2 10 100 100 578 720 Sample Output: 6 0 23 Explanation: For the first case, the Kiwi numbers are 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9.   
It’s World cup time, and every player wants to get a cool jersey number. As a result, there was a fight between the players about what jersey number they can have. To resolve this, the committee (ICC) came up with an idea.  They gave a huge string and asked each player to walk in one by one, and select four indices in the string (i, j, k, l) such that i<=j and k<=l and the substrings S[i..j], S[k..l] should have a non-empty substring in common. Also, (i, j, k, l) should not have been chosen by any player who walked in earlier. If the player is able to give a correct answer (i, j, k, l), he gets "i-j-k-l" as his jersey number. Assuming that there are enough players to claim all valid jersey numbers, and that all players are equally smart (i.e if there is any valid (i, j, k, l), then they’ll give the right answer), find the number of distinct jersey numbers that can be assigned. Note: The huge string chosen by the ICC is hexadecimal. (Only contains ‘0’-‘9’ and upper-case characters ‘A’-‘F’). Input: The first line of input contains a single integer ’T’, denoting the no. of test cases. Each of the following ’T’ lines contains a sting S, chosen by the ICC. Output: Print one line for each test case, denoting the answer modulo 1000000007. Constraints: 1 <= T <= 200 1 <= |S| <= 100000 1 <= Sum of |S| over all test cases <= 1000000 S is hexadecimal. (Only contains ‘0’-‘9’ and upper-case characters ‘A’-‘F’) Sample Input: 3 AB ACC A2011 Sample Output: 7 30 163 Explanation: For the case "AB", following are valid jersey numbers: {“1-1-1-1”, “1-1-1-2”, “1-2-1-1”, “1-2-1-2”, “1-2-2-2”, “2-2-1-2”, “2-2-2-2”}     
MCG (Melbourne Cricket Ground) is hosting the finals of the Cricket World Cup 2015. In order to capture shots of boundary hits and balls being rubbed on pants with equal clarity, the organizers have decided to arrange n cameras of different resolutions at n different positions on a vertical stand according to a 'Hugphile Order', in remembrance of Phil Hughes. In a Hugphile Order, the cameras are ordered linearly on a vertical stand at positions p1 to pn, such that the camera at position pi (for i = 2..n) has higher resolution than the camera at position p(i/2), where / stands for integer division.   Assuming that the resolutions of the n cameras are in the range 1 to n (both inclusive) and given a camera with resolution m, find the number of possible positions where it can be placed on the stand such that the cameras are in Hugphile Order. Input: First line contains number of testcases, T. Each of the next T lines contain two space-separated integers, n and m Output: Print the answer for each test case on a separate line. Constraints: 1 <= T <= 10^5 1 <= n <= 10^18 1 <= m <= n  Sample Input: 3 2 1 4 2 5 3 Sample Output: 1 2 4 Explanation: For the first example, camera with resolution 1 can come at position p1 only. For the third example, camera with resolution 3 can come at any position except position p1. 
Having won the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup, India is definitely one of the favorites to win the 2015 World Cup. In preparations for the 2015 World Cup, the coach of the Indian cricket team (well, Duncan Fletcher, not Ravi Shastri) wants to experiment with opening batsmen pairs.  An opening pair is denoted by (A, B), meaning that batsman A takes strike and batsman B is the non-striker. There are 'N' matches remaining before the World Cup starts. Being rather meticulous and eager to keep his high salary, the coach wants to experiment with opening batsmen pairs based on the following conditions: 1) No batsman A should face the first ball in more than 1 match, i.e., cannot be the opening striker in more than 1 match. 2) No batsman B should be the 2nd opener in more than 1 match, i.e., cannot be the opening non-striker in more than 1 match. 3) The same opening pair cannot open the batting in more than one match, i.e., if (A, B) open the batting in some match, then neither (A, B) nor (B, A) can open the batting in any other match. Note: The opening pair (A, B) is different from the opening pair (B, A). Also, it goes without saying that the two batsmen in the opening pair should be distinct, i.e (A, A) is not a valid opening pair. The coach has a total of 'K' batsmen to choose from, and was wondering in how many ways he could choose the opening pairs for the N matches modulo 1000000007. Input: The first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases.  Each of the following ’T’ lines contain 2 space separated integers N, K. You need to find the number of ways of choosing the opening pairs for N matches, given K players to choose from. Output: For each test case, print the required answer modulo 1000000007 on a separate line. Constraints: 1 <= T <= 1000 1 <= N <= 10^5 0 <= K <= 10^18 1 <= sum of N over all cases <= 10^6 Sample Input: 3 1 2 2 2 3 3 Sample Output: 2 0 12 Explanation: For the case N=1, K=2, there are 2 ways to choose the opening pairs => {(1,2)}, {(2,1)} For the case N=3, K=3, there are 12 ways to choose the opening pairs. Some of them are: {(1,3), (2,1), (3,2)}, {(1,2), (2,3), (3,1)}, {(1,2), (3,1), (2,3)} … etc.   
Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma are warming up for the World Cup at the Brisbane Cricket Ground, commonly known as "The Gabba". Their coach has asked them to go to the ground at the crack of dawn, and then jog around the stadium in laps. The Cricket Ground has poles spaced equally apart and numbered sequentially from 1 to N. The first M-1 poles lead up to the entrance of the stadium, and the poles numbered M, M+1, ... N are arranged circularly around the stadium, with pole M being next to pole N. Both players start running from pole 1. They always go from pole i to pole i+1, except when i = N, where they go from pole N to pole M.  Due to their different levels of fitness - something that their coach is quite upset about with Virat, that being another story - they have different running speeds P and Q, measured in poles/minute. They have been asked to run for ‘S’ minutes each. Since they can’t keep running for long, the coach has asked them to do short sprints of 1 minute each. First, Virat sprints and covers P poles in 1 minute and stops. Then Rohit sprints and covers Q poles in 1 minute and stops. Virat starts again, and they keep doing this for 2*S minutes (S minutes each). Virat and Rohit are considered to meet if they are at the same pole at the end of some  minute. Can you tell how many times they will meet during their jogging routine?   Input: The first line contains the number of test cases, T. This is followed by T lines, one for each test case. Each test case contains five integers - N, M, S, P and Q. Output: For each test case, output the answer on a new line. Constraints: 1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ M < N ≤ 500 1 ≤ S ≤ 100000 1 ≤ P,Q ≤ 500 P ≠ Q Sample Input: 2 4 1 4 2 3 5 3 10 1 2 Sample Output: 1 3 Explanation: For the first example, Kohli’s position at the end of his 1st, 2nd, 3rd & 4th minutes of run is {3, 1, 3, 1} respectively. While Rohit’s position at the end of his 1st, 2nd, 3rd & 4th minutes of run is {4, 3, 2, 1} respectively. Therefore, they meet exactly once after 8 minutes (their 4 minutes) at pole 1. For the second example, they would meet at the end of their 3rd (total 6th), 6th (total 12th) & 9th (total 18th) minute of run. 
The opening ceremony of the 2015 World Cup will be organized in Christchurch, New Zealand on the 14th of February, 2015. The World Cup organizers have planned an artwork in the form of huge grey circles with black boundaries. They hired number of artists to paint these N circles with each artist painting one circle. However, the artists got carried away by their rivalry and painted over each other’s work, resulting in the some circles overlapping with each other. When two circles overlap, only the later painted one is fully visible, and the earlier painted one and its boundary are partly obscured by the later painted one. The organizers are interested in knowing the total length of the visible black boundary after all N circles have been painted.    Input: The first line contains the number of test cases, T. For each test case, the first line contains N, the total number of circles. Each of the next N lines contains 3 space-separated integers xi, yi and ri, where (xi, yi) is the centre and ri is the radius of the i-th circle. Assumption is that the ith circle will be painted after the 1 to (i-1)th circles and will obscure the intersecting parts of any of these circles that it overlaps with. Note: No 2 circles will overlap completely. In other words, no 2 circles will have the same center and same radius.   Output: For each test case, output the length of the total visible boundary colored black. Absolute error of upto 10^-6 is allowed. Constraints: 1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ N ≤ 100 -10^6 <= yi <= 10^6 -10^6 <= yi <= 10^6     1 <= ri <= 10^6 Sample Input: 2 2 0 0 100 300 0 100 2 0 0 100 150 0 100 Sample Output: 1256.637061 1112.090212 Explanation: For the first example, both circles' boundary is completely visible. For the second example, first circle's boundary is partially visible and second circle's boundary is completely visible.   
Chota Pendrive likes to play with strings a lot. For a given string s, he obtains its compressed string in the following way:   In a single operation, he takes any two consecutive equal characters of s, and removes one of them.  He keeps doing this operation as long as possible.  The resulting string will be the compressed string of s. e.g. if the initial string is "abaaabb", its compressed form is "abab".   Two strings s and t are said to be similar if their compressed strings are equal.   You have to find the number of ordered pairs of similar strings (s, t) having length at least one and at most N. Both s, t contain lower case English alphabet. As the answer could be large, print it modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7).  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. Each test case contains a single integer N. Output For each test case, print a single integer corresponding to the answer of the problem. Constraints  1 ≤ T, N ≤ 5000  Sample  Input  2 1 2  Output  26 754  Explanation In the first example, s and t will be equal and will contain the same character. There are 26 possibilities for that from 'a' to 'z'.  In the second example, we can count the possible (s, t) similar pairs in the following way.   Case 1: s is same as t, there are 26 (each string contains 1 character) + 26 * 26 (each string contains 2 characters) possibilites for that. Case 2: s is of type aa and t is of type a, where a is some character. There are 26 possible cases for this. Case 3: s is of type a and t is of type aa, where a is some character. There are 26 possible cases for this.  So, in total, there are 26 + 26 * 26 + 26 + 26 = 754 ordered (s, t) pairs.

 Captain Rex has been cornered by a battalion of droids and is trying to escape. The droids are in a matrix formation of size N × N. Captain Rex's ammunition is enough to kill only N droids. In order to escape the droids, he must kill one droid from every row and one droid from every column.   Every droid is assigned a number, which is a complicated function of its attributes and rank. More specifically, a droid in row i and column j has been given the number A(i, j). The damage inflicted upon the droid army by killing N droids with numbers X1, X2, ... XN is  bitwise AND of the integers X1, X2, ... XN.   Captain Rex, of course, also wants to cause maximum damage to the droid army. Find the maximum damage he can possibly inflict by killing N droids as he escapes. To reiterate, he must kill exactly one droid from each row and each column to be able to escape successfully.   Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the size of the matrix. The next N lines contain N space-separated integers. Specifically, j^th integer on i^th line contains A(i, j), denoting the number assigned to the corresponding battle droid.   Output  For each test case, output a single line containing an integer corresponding to the maximum damage that Captain Rex can inflict.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ N ≤ 100 0 ≤ A(i, j) ≤ 10^18   Example Input: 2 3 5 7 1 3 4 13 2 7 3 2 3 9 4 1 Output: 5 1  Explanation Example case 1. You can cause a total damage of 5 units by choosing the droids in positions (1, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2) so that the damage incurred is 5 & 13 & 7 = 5. Example case 2. You can select (1, 1) and (2,2) to inflict damage = 3 & 1 = 1. 
 Problem description You will be given a zero-indexed array A. You need to rearrange its elements in such a way that the following conditions are satisfied:  A[i] ≤ A[i+1] if i is even. A[i] ≥ A[i+1] if i is odd.  In other words the following inequality should hold: A[0] ≤ A[1] ≥ A[2] ≤ A[3] ≥ A[4], and so on. Operations ≤ and ≥ should alter.  Input The first line contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains an integer N, that is the size of the array A. The second line of each test case contains the elements of array A  Output For each test case, output a single line containing N space separated integers, which are the elements of A arranged in the required order. If there are more than one valid arrangements, you can output any of them.  Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 100000 Sum of N in one test file ≤ 600000 1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10^9   Example Input: 2 2 3 2 3 10 5 2  Output: 2 3 2 10 5    Explanation Example case 1. A[0] ≤ A[1] is satisfied, 2 ≤ 3. Example case 2. A[0] ≤ A[1] is satisfied, 2 ≤ 10. A[1] ≥ A[2] is satisfied, 10 ≥ 5. Note: 5 10 2 is also valid answer.  
A number is said to be a palindrome if it remains the same when it is read backwards. Eg. 12021 is pallindrome while 21 is not A number is called total-palindromic if it contains a palindrome with odd length greater than 1 and an even palindrome as a substring. For example, the number 22676 is total-palindromic whereas the number 101 is not because it contains the palindrome of odd length 676 and even length 22. While 101 does not contain an even palindrome as a substring. You are given 2 numbers a, b. Output the number of total-palindromic numbers which lie in the range (a,b] i.e set { a+1, a+2, .... b }  Input First line contains number of test cases T. Each test case contains 2 lines.  First line contains the number a Second line contains the number b   Output Output T lines, each line containing an integer - the answer to the test case.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 99 ≤ a < b ≤ 10^18   Example Input: 2 99 100 110 119  Output: 0 1  Explanation In second test case the range is between 110 and 119 i.e the numbers 111,112,113,114,115,116,117,118,119. Of these only 111 contains the odd palindromic substring 111 and even palindromic substring 11. So the answer to this test-case is 1 
 For Turbo C++ Users : Read the following document before attempting the question :   Problem Description Hank Pym is an aspiring student at IIITD. He has almost completed his work on Ultron, the ultimate artificial intelligence. However, one thing remains. He feels that Ultron should have a fail-safe code which can be used to switch him off (just in case Ultron decides to wipe out our race). So, he encodes the number and feeds it into Ultron. Hank shares the number with the rest of the Avengers and the way to decrypt it:   Divide the encrypted number ‘N’ by its biggest prime divisor. Now, divide the resultant number by its biggest prime divisor and continue the process (i.e., recursively) until the resultant number doesn’t have any prime divisors. The decrypted code is the number of times you have to do this process.   Hank wants you to decrypt the number for him, so that he may store it somewhere safe (maybe inside one of the books at the IIITD library).Can you help Hank?  Input First line contains ‘T’, the number of test cases. Each test case is given on a new line, which consists of a number the encrypted number 'N'.  Output For each test case, print the decrypted number.  Constraints Should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have. Format it like:  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^9   Example Input: 4 2 9 100 17  Output: 1 2 4 1    Explanation  For the first test case, 2 has no prime divisors apart from itself. So, the answer is 1. For the second test case, 9 has 3 as the only prime divisor. Dividing it by 3, we get 3.Dividing 3 by itself, we get 1, which has no prime divisors. So, the answer is 2. For the third test case, the largest prime divisor is 5. Dividing, we get 20.The largest prime factor of 20 is 5. So, dividing by 5, we get 4. The largest prime factor of 4 is 2. Dividing, we get 2. Again dividing 2 by 2, we stop at 1.So, we did the division 4 times. Hence, the answer is 4. The fourth test case is similar to the first test case.  
 Gordon breathed heavily. "We can't take a chance. This is our only hope." Hiding under the shadow of Wayne Tower, he and Lucius Fox looked over the hordes of prisoners being released from Blackgate Penitentiary. They were arming up to attack downtown. "They need to cross the Riverwaith Bridge. Due to the damage we caused to it, they can only cross it in a single file. We must use this opportunity to cripple them." said Fox. "I have my undercover officers ready. They have already infiltrated the prisoners." "Hmm, we better give them instructions to position them in the file. I suggest we place the officers such that we keep the prisoners most separated. This will give us a strategic advantage when we strike." Input: First line: one number t , indicating number of test cases  t < 10^6 Next t lines: two space separated numbers indicating the number of prisoners (p) and the number of undercover cops (c). 0<=c<=p<=10^9 Output: A single number (for each test case) ,which tells us the minimum possible consecutive prisoners in the single file, after optimally placing the undercover cops. Sample Input: 3 15 4 15 15 15 0 Sample Output: 3 1 15   
Guru Prakash has recently discovered his sweet heart's (let's call her SH) secret affairs. He was amazed by the number of people one could have an affair with simultaneously. But after delving deeper into the issue he found out that SH has a pattern in her number of affairs she maintains at any point of time. Guru conjectures that at any point in time, the number of affairs SH has is always of the form "a power b"(suprising!). This conjecture is further strengthened by the fact that SH stalks a lot and is always bound to have lots of affairs. Your task is simple. You have to verify if Guru's conjecture is true. In other words, whenever Guru reports the current number of boyfriends SH is having, you have to report if its of the form a^b(both a,b ≥2)  Input Input description.  Every input contains a single integer n (2<=n<=10^16)   The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. Each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of boyfriends SH currently has an affair with.     Output Output description. For each test case, output a single line containing "YES" if its of the form a^b. "NO" otherwise. Quotes given for clarity. Note that a,b ≥2    Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10000 2 ≤ N ≤ 10^16     Example Input: 5 2 3 4 5 6  Output: NO NO YES NO NO     Explanation Example case 1. 2 is not of the form a^b Example case 3. 4 is of the form 2^2 
Arithmetic and geometric Progressions are 2 of the well known progressions in maths. Arithmetic progression (AP) is a set in which the difference between 2 numbers in constant. for eg, 1,3,5,7,9....In this series the difference between 2 numbers is 2.The task here is very simple indeed. You will be given the 3rd term , 3rd last term and the sum of the series. You need to print the length of the series & the series itself.    Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines will have 3 number '3rd term' ,'3rd Last term' and 'sum'.  3rd term  - is the 3rd term in the series 3rd Last term  - is the 3rd term from the end in the series sum - is the sum of the series.       Output For each input of the test case, you need to print 2 lines.  First line should have 1 value-number of terms in the series. 2nd line of the output should print the series numbers separated by single spaces.     Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 All numbers will be less than 10^16. The series will have at least 7 elements. In all the test cases all the series elements are positive integers.     Example Input: 1 3 8 55  Output: 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10   
You a given a tree consisting of N nodes, and a set of Q queries. Each query consists of a pair of nodes (u, v). For each query, find the number of nodes r, such that when you root the tree at r, either u is an ancestor of v, or v is an ancestor of u.  Input  The first line consists of two integers:N and Q. The next N-1 lines consist of 2 integers each: u and v, each describing an edge. The next Q lines consist of 2 integers each: u and v, each describing a query pair (u, v).   Output For each query, output the required answer on a separate line.   Constraints  N, Q <= 10^5 0 <= u, v < N The given graph is a tree For each query pair u, v; u != v     Example Input: 5 5 0 1 1 2 1 3 0 4 4 3 4 1 0 1 0 2 1 2  Output: 2 4 5 3 5   
Oh my God!!! Someone is trying to break into Thapar University's Database and steal sensitive research information. It is now up to us to stop this attack. Fortunately our defense mechanisms have traced the attacks to their source. The fastest way to stop the attacks is to disable the source. So all we need to do is to teach that guy a lesson, by planting a virus in his own system. But before we can do that, we need to break through all the layers of the security he has put around himself. Our sources tell us that the first layer is based on ASCII encryption. We must penetrate through this layer as fast as we can to reach the source...   Input:  The first line will consist of the total number of test cases T. The next T lines will consist of one string on each line.The length of the string should be greater than 2.   Output:  For each test case, output is a single character.    Example: Input:  3 abcd reverse gear    Output:  b m g   
Breaking through the first layer has definitely weakened the hacker, for his attacks are becoming less frequent now. But he may be preparing for something bigger and worse in the meantime. It is essential to break through all the layers as soon as possible. The next layer seems to have a more complex architecture, possibly based on a mathematical foundation.  It is rumoured that the hacker is a huge follower of a great Italian mathematician. You must find a way to break through this next layer...   Input:  The first line will consist of the total number of test cases T. The next T lines will consist of number N on each line.(101 ≤ N ≤ 10000000)   Output:  For each test case, output is a number.    Example: Input:  3 105 675 3254    Output:  1 3 5   
We are very near to our goal now. The enemy is being weakened continuously. But alas, sensing his fall, the hacker has spread a worm into our network. It is consuming all our files at a tremendous rate and must be stopped at all costs. The only way to stop it is to enter a specific code number in to the worm. It is up to you to find an algorithm for the worm's stop code...Time is of the essence, my friend...   Input:  The first line will consist of the total number of test cases T. The next T lines will consist of number N on each line.   Output:  For each test case, output is a number.    Example: Input:  3 34 156 893    Output:  6 0 13   
Now that we have recovered all our data, we can return to hacking in to the hacker's system. Our sources tell us that this hacker's lust for power is so great that it is reflected in everything he does, everything he creates. Perhaps this knowledge can become his weakness in our hands, his thirst for power laying a trap for him. News also arrives of a great weapon being developed by him, soon to be unleashed upon us. Can you break through the next level of his security and disable the cyber weapon while there is still time?   Input:  The first line will consist of the total number of test cases T. The next T lines will consist of one string on each line.   Output:  For each test case, output is a number.    Example: Input:  3 aranya reverse gear    Output:  124 252 159   
At last, we have successfully neutralized all the cyber weapons of mass destruction, saved our university along the way and lay to waste another evil scheme in the process. All that separates that hacker from us now is his last lair of security, his ultimate firewall. It is imperative for us to break through this last line of defense and punish the one responsible for all this loss. Breaking this firewall shall be no easy task, but we aren't letting go either. Shift your gears in reverse and get cracking.   Input:  TThe first line will consist of the total number of test cases T. The next T lines will consist of number N on each line where 1 ≤ N ≤ 100.    Output: For each test case, output is a number.    Example: Input:  3 2 12 44    Output:  8 96 11264

Darshit enters his classroom to discover his Professor Shastri shouting at the top of his voice, and the entire class in commotion. He soon realizes what's wrong.  Someone broke a canister of Deodorant in the class, and Prof. Shastri will do anything to break his bones.  Since no one knows who really did it, and it was probably done by someone from outside the class, the students decide to play a game. The loser of that game would have to own up to Prof. Shastri. This wouldn't be a problem if Darshit wasn't on the defaulters list. But he was, and under no circumstances could own up to this messy situation. Help Darshit figure out exactly which person would be the loser in this game.    The game All the students would sit on their seats, and their names would be written in a list. Then, one by one, names would be struck off the list. A number between 1 and 5 would be chosen, and the striking would proceed based on that number. The second last person to be struck off the list would have to own up to Prof. Shastri  This would've been easy if people still had to sit, but most of the class had already picked their seats!   Note There will be total 5 sample inputs given to your program. All input values lie between 0 and 120.   Sample Assuming a class of 7 students And a random number 3, striking would proceed as follows: 3,6,2,7,5,1,4  Thus, the first person in the original list of names would be the loser.   Example Input (Number of namesXRandom Number)  7X3 5X4 6X5 9X2 3X5  Example Output 1 2 4 7 3 
 Farhan has a standard football that is made of 32 pieces of leather: 12 black pentagons and 20 white hexagons. Each pentagon adjoins 5 hexagons and each hexagon adjoins 3 pentagons and 3 hexagons. Farhan drew a polygon (i.e. a closed line without intersections) along the edges of the pieces. The polygon divided the ball into two parts and Farhan painted one of them green.    He is curious if given a description of the polygon you are able to compute the number of black, white and green pieces?   Task Write a program that:   reads the description of a polygon  computes the number of black, white and green pieces  writes the result    Input  The input has two test cases.  For each test case, the first line of the input contains one integer n being the number of vertices of the polygon. The second line of the input contains n integers a1, a2,..., an separated by single spaces. Integer ai (equal 1 or 2) is the number of green pieces adjoining the i-th vertex of the polygon. The side of the polygon connecting the n-th and the first vertex always lies between two hexagons.  Output  For each test case the first and only line of the output contains three integers b, w and g - the numbers of black, white and green pieces respectively.   Example Sample input: 21 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 1 1 1 21 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 1 1 1 Sample output: 11 15 6 11 15 6 
  Problem description. An arithmetic progression(AP) is a sequence of numbers such that the difference of any two successive members of the sequence is a constant. For example:- 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, ... A geometric progression(GP) is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed non-zero contant. For examplee:- 1, 3, 9, 81, ... (with common ratio of 3). Given three successive members of a sequence, you need to determine the type of the progression and the next successive member.    Input  Each case is specified on a single line with three integers a1, a2, a3 are distinct. The last case is followed by a line with three zeros.  Output  For each test case, your program must print a single line of the form: XX v where XX is either AP or GP depending if the given progression is an Arithmetic or Geometric Progression. v is the next member of the given sequence. All input cases are guaranteed to be either an arithmetic or geometric progressions.  Constraints    Example Input: 4 7 10 2 6 18 0 0 0 Output: AP 13 GP 54 
Dhapu loves programming. So naturally she loves the language of ones and zeroes. She has created a function bitcount(x) which returns the number of set bits in the binary representation of the number 'x'. She would love to stress test her program's performance. She feeds it with queries consisting of 2 integers - l and r. The objective of her program is to find the number 'x' (between l and r, inclusive) such that bitcount(x) is maximum possible. And if there exist multiple such numbers, she wants to print the smallest one. She wants to check if her results are right. Can you make the same program as she did?  Input Format:- The first line contains integer n — the number of queries Each of the following n lines contain two integers l and r.  Output Format:- For every query, print the answer to the problem.  Constraints:- 1 <= n <= 1000  0 <= l <= r <= 10^18 
  Problem description. Dhapu has been reading about communication systems which interests her a lot. There she noticed a peculiar way to measure distance/error between 2 signals called the Hamming Distance. Till now she only knew of Euclidean Distance between 2 points. On searching online, she read the following on Wikipedia:- In information theory, the Hamming distance between two strings of equal length is the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols are different. In another way, it measures the minimum number of substitutions required to change one string into the other, or the minimum number of errors that could have transformed one string into the other. If the length of strings differ, we consider that the Hamming Distance cannot be found out. She wants to see if she has understood the concept clearly. So, she decides to write a program that will find the Hamming Distance between 2 signals. Can you help her?    Input  First line of the input contains the number of test cases T. T test cases follow. Each test case consists of the 2 strings, each on a separate line.   Output For every test case, print the Hamming Distance between the 2 strings. If it doesn't exist, print -1.   Constraints  1 <= T <= 1000 1 <= Length of Signals <= 1000 Strings will consist of only alphabets and numerical digits. Note:- A signal can be represented as a string of characters. Upper case and Lower Case alphabets represent different characters.

  Problem description Yalin has a little sister whom he loves very much. On her birthday, he decides to give her a special dictionary made up of words using just a few alphabets which appear in an odd order. Thinking she will love the gift as much as he did, he gifts it to her. But unfortunately, she doesn't like it at all. She wanted the book "The C Programming Language by Brian Kernighan & Dennis Ritchie". Angered by this, he throws away the dictionary and all the words fell off the book. His little sister starts crying and now demands to know which word appeared where.  Can you help Yalin calm his little sister down on her own birthday?  Note: The dictionary contained only 7 letters in the order - d, h, a, p, u, s, v  Input Format:- First line of the input contains the number of test cases T. T lines follow, each containing an integer. Each line contains the place N of the word Yalin's sister wants to know.  Output Format:- For every test case, print the word that comes at the Nth place.  Constraints:- 1 <= T <= 100 1 <= N <= 10^18  Example:-  Input:-  3  1  2  10  Output:-  d  h  da   
Chef's encounters with sweets continue with this problem! This time, he wants to distribute chocolates to his N students sitting on a long bench. The students are ordered according to the scores they got from the last exam. Chef wants to give more chocolates to the higher-scoring students. He also has a few more restrictions. Here are all the restrictions:  Every student must get at least one chocolate bar. If i < j, then the i^th student gets strictly fewer chocolate bars than the j^th student. The difference between the number of chocolate bars of any two adjacent students must be the same.  Chef has exactly C chocolate bars, and he doesn't want leftovers so every chocolate bar must be given to some student. Is it possible for Chef to finish this task?  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. Each test case consists of a single line containing two space separated integers N and C.  Output For each test case, output a single line containing either “Yes” or “No” (without quotes), denoting whether Chef can accomplish the task or not.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^9 1 ≤ C ≤ 10^18   Example Input: 2 4 24 2 2  Output: Yes No  Explanation Example case 1. In this case, Chef can accomplish the task by giving 3, 5, 7 and 9 chocolate bars to the students. Example case 2. There are 2 students. The first one must get at least 1 chocolate bar. The second one must get strictly more than that, so he/she must get at least 2 chocolate bars. Thus, Chef needs at least 3 chocolate bars. But he only has 2, so the task is impossible. 
  There are two integer arrays: A and B having a size N where N<=1000. You are free to permute the order of the elements in the arrays.   Main problem: Among all the arrangements of the two arrays, is there any case such that Ai+Bi ≥ K for all i where Ai denotes the i^th element in the array A.     Input The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test-cases. T test cases follow. Each test case is given in the following format.   The first line contains two integers, N and K. The second line contains N integers separated by a single space, denoting A array. The third line describes B array in a same format.   Output For each test case, if there is such arrangement exists output YES, otherwise NO.  Constraints 1 <= T <= 10   1 <= N <= 1000   1 <= K <= 10^9   0 <= Ai, Bi <= 10^9   Example Input: 2 3 10 2 1 3 7 8 9 4 5 1 2 2 1 3 3 3 4  Output: YES NO    Explanation The first input has 3 elements in Array A and Array B, we see that the one of the arrangements, 3 2 1 and 7 8 9 has each pair of elements (3+7, 2 + 8 and 9 + 1) summing upto 10 and hence the answer is YES. The second input has B array with three 3s. So, we need at least three numbers in A to be greater than 1. As its not the case, the answer is NO.  
Hermione Granger, the most talented witch of her generation, likes to solve various types of mathematical problems in the Arithmancy class. Today, the professor has given her the following task:  Find the number of fractions a/b such that-  1.	gcd(a, b) = 1 2.	0 < a/b < 1 3.	a * b = (n!) ^ (n!)  Where "n!" denotes the factorial of n and "^" denotes power, i.e. (2!) ^ (2!) = 4.  She is quite confident that she can solve it for n <= 10,000,000 (i.e. 10^7), but then she remembers that she has to study some case history so that she can help Hagrid to win the case of Buckbeak. So, she wants your help to solve the problem.   Input There will be one line for each test case containing the number n (1 <= n <= 10,000,000). Input will be terminated by EOF. There will be around 20,000 test cases.   Output For each case, print the number of fractions in a separate line. This number may be very large, so print the answer modulo 10,007.   Example  Input: 1 2  Output: 0 1 
Asya is not only cute but smart and her young age doesn't stop her from learning different algorithms. These days she is busy in developing an application for communication over a network. Now she needs your help in writing a small program. Your are given the message received by a node on network, R. The message is in binary. The network designed by Asya is pretty awesome. It is assured that at maximum a single bit error can occur in the original message (M). To detect this, the original message is transformed to Encoded message (E). The message is transformed as follows : 1> Blank spaces are inserted (from left) at all positions which are 2^i where i = 0, 1, 2, 3,... 2> At any blank space at position 2^i, the value given is : (sum of all the bits at position x, where i-th bit (from LSB) is set in x) MOD 2. for example; if M = 111110001100 then, inserting blank spaces : _ _ 1 _ 1 1 1 _ 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 _ 0 Blank spaces are at 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 th positions. Now value at position 1 : (sum of bits at position 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17) % 2 						= (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0) % 2 						= 5 % 2 						= 1 value at position 2		: (sum of bits at position 3, 6, 7, 10, 11, 14, 15) % 2 						= (1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0) % 2 						= 4 % 2 						= 0 value at position 4		: (sum of bits at position 5, 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 15) % 2 						= (1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0) % 2 						= 5 % 2 						= 1 value at position 8		: (sum of bits at position 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15) % 2 						= (1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0) % 2 						= 3 % 2 						= 1 value at position 16	: (sum of bits at position 17) % 2 						= 0 % 2 						= 0 So, E = 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 This message E is sent over the network. Now she wants you to write the code to output the correct original message (M), when the input is received message (R). (i.e, you have to develop the decoding algorithm).  Input :  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. Every test case contains a binary string, denoting the received message (R).     Output :  For each test case, output a single line containing the original message (M).     Constraints :  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 3 ≤ |R| ≤ 100000     Example : Input: 2 10111111101011000 110  Output: 111110001100 1    Explanation : Example case 1. R = 10111111101011000 So, E = 10111111100011000 and thus, M = 111110001100  
 Asya is a very intelligent girl and she comes up with very fascinating games to entertain herself. On her b'day she got gifts from Uncle Sai. He gifted her M marbles and a tree with N nodes with each edge of 1-unit length. Asya could keep M marbles in the nodes of the tree and then see them roll from one node to some other node where the marble stops. A marble always ends at some other node than what it started from. After playing a while Asya got bored and thought of making it a lil more interesting. She took her color box and painted every marble differently (with distinct colors). After this she placed these marbles in the tree nodes. Some tree nodes might be empty and some tree nodes may have more than one marble. The marbles then started rolling, painting the edges of the tree. Asya calls an edge beautiful if that edge is colored by all the M colors. Given the tree and initial arrangement of the marbles in the tree and the fact that a marble can end at any other node with equal probability, can you tell Asya the expected value of total length of beautiful edges.   Input :  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of nodes in the tree. N-1 lines follow, each containing two space separated integers, X and Y denoting an edge between node X and Y. The last line of every test case contains N space separated integers, denoting number of marbles at i-th node.     Output :  For each test case, output a single line containing the expected value of total length of beautiful edges. The answer with absolute or relative error no more than 10^-6 will be accepted.     Constraints :  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 3 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ M ≤ 10^2 0 ≤ Node number < N     Example Input: 1 3 0 1 1 2 1 0 1  Output: 1.0000    Explanation Example case 1. There are four possible cases :  Case 1 : Marble at node 0 stops at node 1 and marble at node 2 stops at node 1. In this case there is no beautiful edge. Case 2 : Marble at node 0 stops at node 2 and marble at node 2 stops at node 1. In this case the total length of beautiful edges is 1, (edge between node 1 and node 0). Case 3 : Marble at node 0 stops at node 1 and marble at node 2 stops at node 0. In this case the total length of beautiful edges is 1, (edge between node 0 and node 1). Case 3 : Marble at node 0 stops at node 2 and marble at node 2 stops at node 0. In this case the total length of beautiful edges is 2, (both the edges). So, the final answer is (1/4)*0 + (1/4)*1 + (1/4)*1 + (1/4)*2 = 1  Note : Use of fast I/O is recommended 
 ACM International Collegiate     Programming Contest, Asia-Amritapuri Site, 2012 Gandalf vs the Balrog  'We fought far under the living earth, where time is not counted. Ever he clutched me, and ever I hewed him, till at last he fled into dark tunnels.     Ever up now we went, until we came to the Endless Stair. Out he sprang, and even as I came behind, he burst into new flame.     Those that looked up from afar thought that the mountain was crowned with storm.     Thunder they heard, and lightning, they said, smote upon Celebdil, and leaped back broken into tongues of fire.' - Gandalf, describing his fight against the Balrog.  Although Gandalf would not go into the details of his battle, they can be summarized into the following simplified form: both Gandalf and the Balrog have a set of N attacks they can use (spells, swords, brute-force strength etc.). These attacks are numbered from 1 to N in increasing order of Power. When each has chosen an attack, in general, the one with the higher power wins. However, there are a few ("M") anomalous pairs of attacks, in which the lesser-powered attack wins.  Initially, Gandalf picks an attack. Then the Balrog counters it with one of the remaining attacks. If the Balrog's counter does not defeat Gandalf's, then we say Gandalf receives a score of 2. If however it does, then Gandalf has exactly one more opportunity to pick an attack that will defeat the Balrog's. If he manages to defeat him now, his score will be 1, whereas if he is still unable to defeat him, his score will be 0.  Your task is to determine, given N and the M anomalous pairs of attacks, what will be Gandalf's score, given that both play optimally. Further, in case Gandalf gets a score of 2, you must also determine which attack he could have chosen as his first choice.  Note 1: The Balrog can choose only one attack, whereas Gandalf can choose upto two. Note 2: The relation A defeats B is not transitive within the attacks. For example, attack A can defeat attack B, attack B can defeat attack C, and attack C can defeat attack A. Note 3: Between any two attacks A and B, either attack A defeats attack B or attack B defeats attack A.  Input (STDIN):  The first line will consist of the integer T, the number of test-cases. Each test case begins with a single line containing two integers N and M. This is followed by M lines consisting of 2 integers each x and y, denoting that x and y are an anomalous pair.  Output (STDOUT):  For each test-case, output a single line either 2 A, if Gandalf can defeat any attack the Balrog chooses if he picks attack A, 1, if Gandalf can choose an attack such that even if the Balrog chooses an attack to defeat him, he can choose an attack to defeat the Balrog's chosen one, 0, if none of the above two options are possible for all possible choices of Gandalf's attack(s). Between successive test cases, there should not be any blank lines in the output.  Constraints:  1 <= T <= 15 3 <= N <= 1,000,000 0 <= M <= min(N(N-1)/2, 300,000) 1 <= x < y <= N for all the anomalous pairs (x,y) The sum of M over all test-cases will not exceed 300,000.  Sample Input:   2 3 0 3 1 1 3  Sample Output:   2 3 1  Notes/Explanation of Sample Input:  In the first case, attack 3 can beat both attacks 1 and 2. So Gandalf just chooses attack 3. In the second case, attack 1 beats 3 which beats 2 which beats 1. No matter which attack Gandalf chooses, the Balrog can pick the one which defeats his, but then he can pick the remaining attack and defeat the Balrog's. 
  Problem description.  Pooja would like to withdraw X $US from an ATM. The cash machine will only accept the transaction if X is a multiple of 5, and Pooja's account balance has enough cash to perform the withdrawal transaction (including bank charges). For each successful withdrawal the bank charges 0.50 $US. Calculate Pooja's account balance after an attempted transaction.  Input Positive integer 0 < X <= 2000 - the amount of cash which Pooja wishes to withdraw. Nonnegative number 0<= Y <= 2000 with two digits of precision - Pooja's initial account balance.  Output Output the account balance after the attempted transaction, given as a number with two digits of precision. If there is not enough money in the account to complete the transaction, output the current bank balance.  Example - Successful Transaction. Input: 30 120.00  Output: 89.50  Example - Incorrect Withdrawal Amount (not multiple of 5) Input: 42 120.00  Output: 120.00  Example - Insufficient Funds Input: 300 120.00  Output: 120.00 
   Mr. Yagami is a scientist in the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre. They are   conducting a lab experiment on nuclear fission. In nuclear fission, one atom   breaks into more than one atom of the same type.    Initially, there are N atoms in the lab. Starting from now (t=0), after each   second, every atom will break into K atoms of the same type. They don’t want   the number of atoms to exceed M, so they have to stop the reaction at some   time t=T. Can you find this value T for Mr. Yagami.   Input Format:    First line contains P, the number of test cases. Next P lines contain three   integers each. These three integers represent the values of N, K and M   respectively.   Output Format:    For each test case print the time at which the reaction will have to be   stopped.   Constraints:     1 ≤ P ≤ 10^4   2 ≤ N, K, M ≤ 10^18    Sample Input:  2 2 2 7 2 2 8 Sample Output:  1 2 Explanation:    1st test case:   at t=1, number of atoms=4   at t=2, number of atoms will be 8.   So reaction has to be stopped at t=1.   2nd test case:   at t=1, number of atoms=4   at t=2, number of atoms will be 8.   at t=3, number of atoms will be 16.   Problem Setter: Lalit Kundu

But he is really disappointed with the behavior of the contestants as they are not very willing to do class or learn new things .  So he decided to set a  problem on new topic in Intra AUST Programming contest that they will learn this topic through reading the problem statement . We asked him about the problem and fortunately he shared his problem with us .    Euler circuit is a path that starts from any node ,  uses every edge of a graph exactly once and then finishes at same starting node .  In this Problem there is given a graph with ‘V’ vertexes and ‘E’ edges .  Your task is to find there exists a euler circuit  or not . If so then print “Yes” otherwise print “No” .    Algorithm to detect Euler Circuit  :  Graph should be connected Degree of every vertex should be even . Degree of a vertex means total incoming and outgoing edge of a vertex .   Input Input starts with an integer T ( 1 <= 30 ) , number of test cases . Each test case consists of two integer n ( 1 <= n <= 500 ) and m ( 1 <= m <= 10000 ) where n is the number of nodes and m is number of edges between these nodes .

  Your friend Ayman has started a course for learning to play guitar. The instructor introduces him the basic functionality of guitar. The fret board is the element where guitar strings are placed on it. The fret board has been assigned some numbers for denoting each of the fret.  Number 1 to 12 has been assigned for numbering each of the fret. The picture will help you understand.  Besides, there are six strings which are denoted by E, B, G, D, A, E (from top to bottom) in standard tuning. Finding particular note for the particular fret position and string is very important. There are basically 12 important notes. The followings are the notes which maintain the ordering:   The note continues circularly. That means after the B there will be C, C#, D . . . .  etc. For each fret of a particular string the notes follow the above ordering. For example, considering the E string (1st String), in the first fret it will have the note F, then for the second fret is F#, for the third is G and it maintains above pattern of the chart up-to fret 12.   Your friend, Ayman becomes confused finding out the note. Can you assist him to find out the particular fret note of a given string?  Input First of all there will be T test cases.  For each of the test case, there will be two integer value  f (1<=f<=12) and s (1<=s<=6) , were f denotes the position of the fret and s denotes the string number (here, the strings are numbered 1 to 6 from top to bottom)  Output For each test case, print a line “Case x: y” where x is replaced by the test case number and y is replaced by the note of that particular fret for that particular guitar string.  Example Input: 5 1	1 4	2 12	3 8	4 8	6    Output:  Case 1: F Case 2: D# Case 3: G Case 4: A# Case 5: C

   Michael Clarke is Secretary of the Australian Cricket Club. When the club gathers together, the players behave badly due to their bad performance in the Cricket World Cup 2015. They've brought lots of ropes to the club and got tied with each other. Specifically, each rope ties together two players. Also, if two players are tied together, then the rope connects the first player with the second one as well as the second player with the first one.     As Captain Clarke is already angry at their bad performance, this scenario got him more angrier. In his anger and frustration, Clarke does the following. First, for each player, Clarke finds out what other players he is tied to. If a player is tied to exactly one other player, Clarke reprimands him. Then Clarke gathers in a single group all the players who have been just reprimanded. He then throws them out from the club. This group of players immediately leaves the club. These players takes with them the ropes that used to tie them. Then again for every players Clarke finds out how many other players he is tied to and so on. And they do so until Clarke can reprimand at least one player. He doesn't even care if the club gets empty in the process.   Determine how many groups of players will be thrown out of the club.   Input The first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases are follow The first line contains two integers n and m — the initial number of players and ropes. The players are numbered from 1 to n, and the ropes are numbered from 1 to m. Next m lines each contain two integers a and b — the numbers of players tied by the i-th rope (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n, a ≠ b). It is guaranteed that no two players are tied with more than one rope. No rope ties a player to himself.   Output Print the single number — the number of groups of players that will be thrown out from the club.  Constraints 1 <= n <= 1000 <= m <= (n*(n-1))/2 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n, a ≠ b  Example Input: 1 3 3 1 2 2 3 3 1  Output: 0   Input: 1 6 3 1 2 2 3 3 4  Output: 2  Input: 1 6 5 1 4 2 4 3 4 5 4 6 4  Output: 1   Explanation Case 1: In this case, Clarke won't throw out any group of players — in the initial position every player is tied to two other players and Clarke won't be able to reprimand anyone. Case 2: In this case, four players are tied in a chain and two more are running by themselves. First Clarke throw out the two players from both ends of the chain (1 and 4), then — two other players from the chain (2 and 3). At that the players who are running by themselves will stay in the club. Case 3: In the third sample, Clarke will momentarily kick out all players except for the fourth one and the process stops at that point. The correct answer is one.  
  Fahim is going to make a social network which is now under construction. There are two ways to make friends in social network.  Type 1: Any person goes to his / her friend list then choose a friend and search his / her friend list (this website is under construction so friend list is public). From there he can choose a person and give him/her a friend request or go to his / her friend list and repeat this.  Type 2: Search a random user by typing his / her name and give him / her friend request.  Now Fahim wants a track of friendships formed by  Type 1  and  Type 2. When two people become friends, check whether it is possible by Type 1 method. If yes, then report “Found in friend list” otherwise report “Found by random”. As he is lazy, he is asking your help to do this job.   Input The first line contains  Query Q (Q <= 100000). Next Q line contains two names who become friends  A, B. A  sends  B  a friend request.  0 < Length of each name <= 10  0 < Sum of length of all names <= 1000000  Output Output for each query in a separate line, print “Found in friend list” if it is possible in  Type 1  method otherwise print  “Found by random”..  Example Input: 3 A B A C B C    Output:  Found by random Found by random Found in friend list   
The aliens of Pandora have multiple avatars(incarnations). They can change from one avatar to another. But in doing so they suffer from varied amount of memory loss. Detailed study by alien scientists revealed that this memory loss is related to the extent of genetic variations between the avatars. Each of the avatar have a characteristic genetic makeup which comprises of 26 nucleotides denoted by a,b,c,...x,y,z(thus proving their superiority to humans which have just lesser number of nucleotides). The memory loss is inversely related to the length of the maximum continuous common portion of their genetic sequence before and after their transformation into the new avatar. Considering this task as a trivial one the alien scientists have decided to assign this work of finding the maximum continuous common portion of the genetic sequences to junior aliens. Help the junior aliens in solving the problem and thus befriend them.   Input The first line of the input contains a space separated two integers N and M denoting the lengths of the two genetic sequences. Each of the next two lines contain the genetic sequence of an avatar.    Output A number denoting the maximum continuous common portion of the genetic sequence of the two avatars so as to minimize the memory loss.   Test Data: The maximum size of the genetic sequence is 75.   Input: 15 20 qasfdthegdtghas hsydgetdgsfarsfthegt  Output: 4

Bob fell in love with LCM and GCD. So much that he started seeing LCMs and GCDs everywhere. Betty, his girl friend was jealous and she gave Bob an array A[ ] of integers, which had nothing to do with LCMs or GCDs. Quickly, naughty Bob evaluated a new array B[ ] containing n integers, such that B[i] is LCM(1,2,3,...,A[i]), if A[i]>0. When A[i] is 0, B[i] is also 0. Angry Betty decided to give m queries to Bob, each being one of the following type: -   "0 i j p", meaning add 'p' to each element in A[i..j]. ( -300000 ≤ p ≤ 300000) -   "1 i j"    , meaning print the LCM of all elements in B[i..j]. 0 ≤ i -   "2 i j"    , meaning print the GCD of all elements in B[i..j].0 ≤ i  Input First line contains n(n ≤ 100000 ) and m( m ≤ 35000 ). Second line contains n integers in the original array A[ ] . Next m lines contain one of the above said queries. It is guaranteed that A[i] after any number of updates will satisfy 0 ≤ A[i] ≤ 300000.  Output Output one line for each query of type 1 or 2, modulo 1000000007.  Example  Input: 5 5 4 1 3 6 2 1 2 4 2 1 3 0 0 3 2 1 1 2 2 2 4   Output: 60 1 60 2  
Flibonakki series G(n) is defined as             G(n) = G(n-1) + f(4n-1)   , for n > 0  and    G(0) = 0  f(i) is our good old Fibonacci series. Given n you need to evaluate G(n).  Input First line contains number of test cases t (t    Output For each test case print the nth flibonakki number modulo 1000000007.  Example  Input: 2 2 4   Output: 15 714   
N ports are to be constructed on the bytelandian river. Since trade occurs only along a Y miles stretch of the river, the distance between the first and  the last port must be Y. To optimize the ship movement between important ports, the distance between any two consecutive ports has been fixed to be within a range of possible distances. Also, distance between two consecutive ports can only be an integer number of miles. As a programmer you have been assigned the job of evaluating the number of different possible arrangements of ports modulo 1000000007.  Input First line of input contains t. The number of test cases. (t First line of each test case contains two integers: N, the number of ports (N ≤ 20) and Y, the ditance between the first and the last port. (Y Next (N-1) lines of the test case contains the range of distances between consecutive ports, with ith line giving two integers, the minimum and maximum gap between (i-1)th and ith port.  Output Print one of output for each test case which is the number of possible arrangements modulo 1000000007.  Example  Input: 1 2 4 0 3 0 3   Output: 3  
Given an nxn grid of cells, a bacteria colony can colonize these cells. Their growth after every second is governed by the following rules:  1) One new bacteria is born in cell (i ,j) if and only if either one of its four neighboring cells or the cell(i,j) itself has a bacteria population more than or equal to the threshold value, k.  2) Already living bacterias do not die.  Given, the initial state of the nxn cell grid, you need to accurately estimate the time by when the total bacteria population reaches m.  Input First line contains t, number of test cases. Each test case starts with n (side length of grid ) , k (growth threshold) and m (final population). Next n lines contain an nxn grid of integers, where ith row,jth column tells the number of bacteria's present initially at cell(i,j).  1<  n ≤ 100 , 0<  k ≤ 2^45 , 0< m ≤ 2^45,  There are no more than n cells with initial population equal to or greater than k.   Output For each test case print the number of seconds required for the total bacteria population to reach m. If m can never be reached print "Not possible" (quotes for clarity).  Example  Input: 1  3 5 15  0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 5   Output: 3  
A group of N shoppers go to a supermarket. The supermarket has M items. Each shopper wants to buy only the items he likes. They plan to buy K items in all. A shopper can buy at max only one item. Some shoppers may not buy anything and some items might not be bought.  Input First line contains the number of test cases. Each test case contains three integers N , M and K separated by spaces. Then follow N lines containing M characters each. If jth character of ith line is 1 then ith shopper likes item j.  1 ≤ K ≤ N, M ≤13  Output For each test case, output the number of ways K items in all can be bought.  Example  Input: 1 4 4 2 1111 0100 0100 1100   Output: 14  
Godi and Abhik are two good friends. But then the day of Department elections came. They both knew that no one in the department is as jobless as they are to contest for the post of Secretary. They had specific set of skills with which they developed closed friends group for the past three years. People belonging to that group socialize with each other so they knew each other well. But when they both decided to go apart, the group split into two parts. And thereafter, no one from a group communicates with anyone from the opposite.   The department also has a set of students (say S) who don't mingle well with either of the groups. This is mainly because even though they like Godi or Abhik they don't want to mingle with everyone else in the respective groups. Godi and Abhik used their campaigning skills to attract as much crowd as possible from that set S. (They even supplied food to the student's door steps). Eshwar as greedy as always, thinks that if he pretends to support both Abhik and Godi, he can gain more. He has his own followers including Pradeep.   Subbu, the current secretary is tired of the cheap tricks played by the students belonging to the set S. He decides to conduct the elections as fairly as possible. So, he declares that "If and only if students belonging to the set S plan to support at-most one candidate, the elections can proceed". Obviously, he din't mean that all the students from the set S must support the same group. To check this, he prepares the list of connections between the students (by their ids). If a student is connected to a candidate (directly or indirectly) this implies he/she supports that candidate. But he later forgets the names of the students and just remembers the ids and the list of connections. So, he just checks whether he can construct a network where there is no one like Eshwar (who supports both the candidates) present in the final network. Some students like Spandana may be busy studying that they don't even know the elections are going on. Also there may be the case that no one is in the set S.  Subbu is perfectly fine with all these situations.  Now, Abhik and Godi are worried whether the elections will proceed or not. They seek your help, so that they can continue campaigning. Output "YES" if the elections will proceed, else print "NO".    Note that students from set S can support a candidate by connecting with at-least one of the students belonging to the closed group of that candidate(incl. the candidate itself). And also sometimes either Godi or Abhik or both can go missing from the list of connections. In that case we can assume that their closed group will also be missing. But it is not assured that they will have non-empty friends group if they are present. Hence, if either or both the candidates are missing then we can safely assume that elections can proceed(what a irony!)   Input Input description.  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers N, M. N denotes the number of students in the department and M denotes the number connections between them in the list prepared by Subbu. Then M lines follow. the ith line describes the ith connection. It contains two space separated integers u and v (u != v). u and v denotes the id of the students and they are 1-indexed.     Output Output description.  For each test case, output "YES" if elections can proceed else output "NO".(Quotes for clarity. Do not print them)     Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 20 2 ≤ N ≤ 500 1 ≤ M ≤ N*(N-1)/2     Example Input: 5 2 0  2 1 1 2  5 2 1 4 2 3  5 5 1 4 3 5 2 1 4 2 2 5  5 3 1 2 2 3 4 5  Output: YES YES YES NO YES    Explanation Example case 1. No one is connected. There can't be anyone like Eshwar planning to do the cheap trick.  Example case 2. Student 1 is connected to Student 2. Subbu can consider this a perfect network by assuming Student 1 as Abhik and Student 2 to be his friend. Or the same with Godi. He can also assume Student 1 is Abhik/Godi and Student 2 is from set S.   Warning  Input text files contains large I/O. Consider using faster I/O techniques.

 Pranay went to the sea shore and saw what looked like a treasure chest floating. Examining the locking mechanism, he immediately realized he came across a set of puzzles in FreakoMatix-Axis'10 to reward those who are skilled in the mathematical arts and punish those who are not. There were six dials of the digits 0 through 9 in the puzzle accompanied by a message : "You will be given two positive integers lesser than or equal to a billion. You need to tell the final 6 digits of raising the first to the power of the second". Pranay was overstruck with grief. With such huge numbers, the multiplications could take ages, but he had no more than a few seconds to give the right answer.   Input Input will consist of multiple lines, each containing two integers A and B (1 ≤ A, B ≤ 1000000000), separated by a space. A line containing two zeros signals the end of input and should not be processed.  Output For each line of input, print out the correct dial settings, i.e. the final six digits of A^B.  Example  Input: 421 1988 628 496 0 0   Output: 362161 493696

  Yesterday was Anish's birthday. The most interesting gift was definitely the chessboard. Anish quickly learned the rules of chess and started to beat all his peers.    That day night Anish was reading a Book on puzzles and Enigma. He opened the book somewhere in the middle and read the following problem: "How many knights can be placed on a chessboard without threatening each other?" After a while he realized that this was trivial and moved on to the next problem: "How many bishops can be placed on a chessboard without threatening each other?". Anish is in trouble here. He is not able to solve this problem and needs your help.    Anish's chessboard has size N x N. A bishop can move to any distance in any of the four diagonal directions. A bishop threatens another bishop if it can move to the other bishop's position. Your task is to compute the maximum number of bishops that can be placed on a chessboard in such a way that no two bishops threaten each other.   Input   The input file consists of several lines. The line number i contains a single number N representing the size of the i-th chessboard. [N ≤ 10^100]   Output   The output file should contain the same number of lines as the input file. The i-th line should contain one number - the maximum number of bishops that can be placed on i-th chessboard without threatening each other.   Example   Input  2  Output  2  
  Our college's best band VAPOUR SUNDAY is getting bigger and bigger by playing in many places, they rocked AAROHI09 and are a very famous band in the Central India, and the band's lead guitarist Karan kalanis music collection is getting bigger so he plans to write every bands songs into a CD and gave all of this job to his manager T Pramod. As the number of CDs increased, Pramod built his boss a shelf on which the CDs stand vertically. But Pramod now needs your help! he has written a title for each CD into a text file, but he needs the titles to appear vertically so that he can put them in the spine of the CD cases and be able to read them easily from the shelf. Pramod wants you to write a program that will output the titles vertically. He needs lines between each title so that, when he prints them, he can easily cut along the lines. He has worked out that he can fit 36 characters into the available space, so all output titles must be 36 characters long, padded with spaces at the end where necessary. If he accidentally makes a title too long, only output the first 36 characters.    CAN YOU HELP PRAMOD????   Input   Input will be at most 50 titles, one to a line. Each title consists of 1 to 100 arbitrary characters('A'-'Z', 'a'-'z', '0'-'9' and space are valid characters). A single `#' on a line by itself indicates the end of input.   Output   Output will be the same titles presented vertically, where the left to right order will be the same as the order of the input. There will be a column of bar (`|') characters at each end, and separating each title, and a row of minus (`-') characters (1 per column) at the beginning and end.

 ACM International Collegiate     Programming Contest, Asia-Amritapuri Site, 2012 Entmoot       'Hoo, ho! Good morning, Merry and Pippin!' he boomed, when he saw them. 'You sleep long. I have been many a hundred strides already today. Now we will have a drink, and go to Entmoot.'     'Where is Entmoot?' Pippin ventured to ask.     'Hoo, eh? Entmoot?' said Treebeard, turning round. 'It is not a place, it is a gathering of Ents - which does not often happen nowadays. But I have managed to make a fair number promise to come.'   Indeed, Entmoot cannot be thought of as any particular place, since where it occurs changes from time to time. The choice of the location however, follows a basic principle: Although the Ents (walking and talking Trees - "shepherds of Fangorn Forest") are by and large not hasty, when it comes to gathering for Entmoot, they would like to choose a location that ensures all the Ents can reach as soon as possible.  Note however, that the speed they can travel varies from Ent to Ent. Also, although Fangorn Forest has dense overgrowth, with regard to the Ents, the forest poses no obstacles.  You are given the locations of N Ents who have agreed to join in for Entmoot, as well as their speeds. You need to find out when Entmoot will occur. Formally, given the (x[i],y[i]) along with speed s[i] for each Ent, find the point (X, Y) such that the maximum time taken by any of the Ents to reach (X, Y) is minimized. Output the earliest time when all the Ents can meet.  Input (STDIN):  The first line contains T, the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains N, the number of Ents. The next N lines contain three space-separated integers each. The ith of these lines contains : x[i], y[i], s[i].  Output (STDOUT):  Output one line per test case, containing the earliest time when the Ents can meet. Relative and absolute error of 10^-4 are acceptable.  Constraints:  1 <= T <= 10 2 <= N <= 50 -1,000,000 <= x[i], y[i] <= 1,000,000 1 <= s[i] <= 1,000,000  Sample Input:   4 3 0 3 3 4 0 4 -3 -4 5 3 0 10 2 0 20 2 0 40 2 3 0 100 15 0 -100 15 8 0 7 3 0 0 1 10000 0 1 5000 8661 1  Sample Output:   1.000000 7.500000 6.666667 5773.751357  Notes/Explanation of Sample Input:  In the first test case, all the ents can meet at origin in 1 unit of time. In the second test case, the first and the third ent reach (25,0) after 7.5 units of ime, whereas the second ent reaches there after 2.5 units of time and waits for the remaining ents to arrive. In the third test case, all the ents can meet at origin in 100/15 units of time. 
Problem Description Now that the votes have been casted, its time to count them. The ballot box has been locked with a secret code and has been handled to the Election Commission for counting. The ballot box is very secure. It has 5 digits on its lock and only a particular combination of the digits can unlock it. The digits on the lock can be changed only with the help of a laser machine. The laser machine is very unique. It has K keys (with a number on each key) on it. In each step, it multiplies the 5 digit number on the ballot box with any of its keys and then takes the remainder with 10^5 so as to make the number back to 5 digits. Note that numbers are have leading 0's in case it is less than 5 digits. But using the laser machine is very expensive. Each step costs C Rupees. So the election commission wants to know the minimum cost to unlock the ballot box. Given the initial code, the final code (which unlocks the box), the K Keys and the cost per operation C, your job is to help find the minimum cost to unlock the box, or report that the box cannot be opened.  Input The first line of the input consists of the number of cases (T). T test cases follows. Each test case begins with a line containing 4 numbers K C I F, where K is the number of Keys on the laser, C is the cost of using laser once, I is a 5 digit initial code and F is a 5 digit final code to unlock. Next line contains K numbers, keys[] which are the keys on the laser machine. Output For each test case, output a line with one number which is the minimum cost to open the box. If the box can never be opened output -1 instead. Constraints  T ≤ 50 1 ≤ K ≤ 10 1 ≤ C ≤ 10^7 I, F are 5 digit numbers and can have leading zero's. 0 ≤ Keys[] ≤ 10^5 Sample Cases  2 2 10 00002 00016 2 4 2 10 00002 00001 2 4 Output  20 -1 Explanations  In the first case, you can use the key with number 2 to first reach to 4 and then use key 4 to reach 16. So laser was used two times. In the second case, whatever you multiply, you will never be able to reach an odd number.  
   Mr. Naughty likes to play with balls. So his friend, Mr Nice, gave him n   balls to play a game. Each ball has exactly two numbers (the number on the top   and the number on the bottom). In one move Mr Naughty can rotate any ball so   that its bottom now becomes the top. Mr Nice knows the minimum number of such   moves that can make at least half of the balls show same number on their top.   So to win Mr Nice's game, Mr Naughty should figure out the minimum number of   moves. Its not always possible to make such moves that satisfy the given   condition.In this case Mr Naughty should figure out that it is "Impossible" to   make such moves.   Help Mr Naughty to win the game.   Input Format:    The first line contains a single integer n - the number of balls. The   following n lines contain the description of all balls, one ball per line.   Each description has a pair of non-negative integers not exceeding 10^5 -   numbers on top and bottom. The first number in a line is the number on top,   the second one - on the bottom. The number on the top of the ball may be same   as the number on the bottom.   The numbers in the lines are separated by single spaces.   Output Format:    On a single line print a single integer - the minimum number of moves to win   the game. If it is impossible to make the set funny, print "Impossible"   (quotes for clarity).   Constraints:    1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5   Sample Input:  3 3 100 100 3 5 4 Sample Output:  1 Explanation:    In this case Mr Naughty can rotate the first ball so that number on the top   becomes 100. Since two of the three balls have same number on their top (100),   you do not need to change anything else, so the answer is 1.   Sample Input:  5 5 9 5 9 3 2 1 4 5 7 Sample Output:  0 Sample Input:  3 1 2 3 4 5 6 Sample Output:  Impossible Problem Setter: Prateek Sachdev 
A balanced prime is one which is the average of the previous and the next prime number. Your task in this problem is to write a program that can calculate the nth balanced prime  Input The first line of input contains t, the number of test cases.

 There is a bank which gives their customers a password 'only' for transactions(there is no username) via ATM. Also the ATM does not have any enter key, it automatically logs you into your account as soon as you enter the right password. There is a huge problem in such type of system,i.e., suppose that if two people A and B have “aadil” and “aadilahmad” as their passwords respectively, so whenever B will try to login, the machine will automatically login B into A’s account.   Input: 	First line of the input contains an integer N,the number of users in Bank. Next N lines contains strings which are passwords of the users. Tell if the bank is vulnerable or non-vulnerable.   Output: Print "vulnerable" if the bank is vulnerable or "non vulnerable" if the bank is not vulnerable.   Program constraints - N <= 10^5 All passwords consists of lower case english alphabets 1<=length of password<=50   Sample Input - 2 likemeifyoucan likeme   Sample Output - vulnerable  
 In numeral systems, the radix or base is the number of unique digits, including zero, that a numeral system uses to represent numbers. For example, for the decimal system (the most common system in use today) the radix is ten, because it uses the ten digits from 0 through 9. And hence, in such a number system 9 is followed by 10 , 11 and so on. Your task is to rite a program that converts a number from a radix 10 system to other system with a different radix.   Input  The first line will contain a single positive integer T denoting the number of lines following it. After the first line , T lines follow each containing two numbers N (0 ≤ N ≤ 1000). and D (2 ≤ D ≤ 9).Here D denotes the radix or base in which N is supposed to be converted.   Output  A set of T lines should be printed , each lines containing one number which is the converted form of N in the base D   Example  Input: 5 4 2 7 4 9 8 45 3 27 6 Output: 100 13 11 1200 43

This year at Utthaan, Miss West Bengal will be the Prime Judge of the Fashionista. All contestants are given an unique contestant number. The pre round of fashionista is done and the Miss West Bengal is confused about how many contestant to select for the finals, as all are equally talented. As she is a student of computer science and her teacher, Mr. Abhishek Sir, being very fond of coding, suggests her an unique way to decide how many contestant to select for the finals. She wants to select even number of participants, so that they can form a pair during the show. All contestants are standing in a row. Mr. Abhishek forms a string by appending the contestant numbers. Now he forms the longest sub-string whose sum of first half and the second half is same. The number of participants that will be going to the finals is the length of this sub-string.  You are given the string that is formed by appending the contestant numbers.  Input  First line has a number T, the number of test cases. Next T lines contents the appended sting.   Output Output the Number of contestants that will be selected for the finals.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ Length of string ≤ 10 ^3   Example Input: 1 0123213  Output: 6  Explanation From the appended string, 1+2+3=2+1+3. Hence the answer is 6. Note that Even number contestants are to be selected for the finals. 
A cricket team consists of 11 players and some are good at batting, others are good at bowling and some of them are good at both batting and bowling. The batting coach wants to select exactly K players having maximum possible sum of scores. Given the batting score of each of the 11 players, find the number of ways in which we can select exactly K players such that the sum of their scores is the maximum possible. Two ways are different if there is a player who is selected in one of them is not in the other. See explanation of sample cases for more clarity.   Input First line contains T, number of test cases ( 1 ≤ T ≤ 100 ). T cases follow, each having 2 lines. First line of each case contains scores of 11 players ( 1 ≤ score ≤ 100 ) and the second line contains K (1 ≤ K ≤ 11)   Output For each test case, output the answer in a new line.   Example  Input: 2 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 3 2 5 1 2 4 1 6 5 2 2 1 6  Output: 1 6   Explanation: Case 1 : Maximum possible sum of scores = 11 + 10 + 9 = 30 and can be achieved only by selecting the last 3 players. Only one possible way. Case 2 : Maximum possible sum of scores = 6 + 5 + 5 + 4 + 2 + 2 = 24 and considering the players as p1 p2 p3 ... p11 in that order, the ones with maximum possible sum of scores is as follows {p1, p2, p4, p5, p7, p8 } {p10, p2, p4, p5, p7, p8 } {p1, p2, p10, p5, p7, p8 } {p9, p2, p4, p5, p7, p8 } {p1, p2, p9, p5, p7, p8 } {p10, p2, p9, p5, p7, p8 } 
There are N participants in a chess competition. They are given unique ids, numbered from 1 to N. Every participant will play against every other participant in a game. Thus there will be (N*(N-1))/2 games in total. Assume none of the games result in a draw. A sponsor wants to meet all the players. But he can do so only one by one and in the following manner-  He can choose to meet any player at first. After meeting a player i, the next player he meets, say j, should be such that i defeated j.   Help him decide an order such that he is able to meet all the players. If there are multiple such orders, output the lexicographically smallest one. The games are such that if a defeats b, and b defeats c, then a defeats c. He doesn't want to meet any player more than once.   Input  First line contains integer t, the number of test cases. For each test case, first line contains integer N. Next N lines contain a string of 0 and 1 of length N, such that, if jth character of i^th line is 1, then i defeated j, otherwise j defeated i.

The end semester examinations have just been evaluated. The statisticians of the institute are not putting their brains to decide which class is the best of the college.  There are T classes in the college. Each class has exactly N students. The statisticians have decided that the best class is the one in which the difference between the maximum marks obtained and the minimum marks obtained is the least.  They have collected the data of each class. They now want you to calculate quickly the difference of maximum and minimum marks of each class.     Input The first line of input is T N separated by a space. Then T lines follows. Each line has exactly N integers denoting the marks obtained by the students of that class. All numbers are space separated.    Output For each class, output the difference between the maximum and the minimum marks.    Constraints T≤50 1≤N≤100 0 ≤ marks obtained by any student ≤100     Example Input: 2 5 2 4 5 1 3 0 100 90 80 70  Output: 4 100     Explanation Here there are 2 classes with 5 students each. Class 1. The maximum mark is 5 and the minimum is 1. Hence the difference is 5-1 =4. Class 2. The maximum mark is 100 and the minimum is 0. Hence the difference is 100-0 =100. Note: Do NOT ask for inputs by printing “Enter the value of N” etc. The judge is automated and will give you inputs automatically. Similarly, don’t write “The output is __”. Just print the result. 
  Sherlock is now taking a break from his current case and starts reviewing his famous case of "The N Orange Pips". He slips too deep into the case and gives you a puzzle.  Sherlock has N boxes consisting of orange pips. The ith box contains Ai orange pips. He now wants you to take out some pips from each box (you may leave some boxes untouched), such that in all the boxes the remaining number of pips is odd and equal to each other. Also, for each box, the number of pips present after the removal must be a factor of the original number of pips that were present in the box. You need to take as minimum number of pips as possible.  Now Sherlock asks you to tell the number of pips each box will have.  Input The first line consists of the number of boxes, N. N integers follow, each having a single integer, denoting the number of pips in each box.  Output A single integer denoting the number of pips each box will have.  Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ Ai < 2^63   Example Input: 4 98 42 14 28  Output: 7   
 "This is how I want you to remember me. The woman who beat you." ―Irene Adler   Irene Adler knows very well that if there is something Sherlock isn’t good at, it is with the Fibonacci Numbers. She throws him an open challenge. She wants Sherlock to find the number of different ways in which a number N could be represented as sum of Fibonacci numbers, without using K in the representation where K is also a Fibonacci number.  Two representations of a number N are same if the count of each distinct Fibonacci number in the representation is equal.   Sherlock now knows he is screwed. He doesn’t show it, but runs to Watson, that is you, for help. He wants you to help him out with this problem.   Note: The Fibonacci series does not include the number ‘0’. The series is (1,1,2,3,5,.....)  Input  First line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. T lines follow each containing two spaced integers N and K.   Output  For each test case, print the desired output modulo 10^9+7 in separate lines.   Constraints :  1 <= T <= 10^6  1 <= N <= 10^5  1 <= K <= N   Example : Input:  1  4 2   Output :  2    Explanation : The 2 possible solutions are (1,1,1,1) and (1,3).  
Sherlock has recently started playing DOTA - the most addictive strategy game of all time. His favorite attack in the game is the "LVL-Death" spell of a hero called Doom Bringer.  Every time he upgrades this spell the chance that it deals additional damage changes. Suppose K is the power of the spell, Sherlock noticed that the spell deals additional damage to enemy heroes whose level is NOT a K-Prime* number. An enemy hero's level can be between 1 and 10^7. *A K-Prime number is a positive integer that is not divisible by first K prime numbers.  Sherlock wanted to know how effective his spell can be. He wants to know the probability(as an irreducible fraction) of the spell with a power level of K dealing additional damage to an enemy hero whose level could be between L and R (both inclusive). Input First line will contain a number Q. Next Q lines will contain 3 space separated integers L, R and K Output Your output should contain exactly Q lines where i-th line is the answer to the i-th query. For every query print the required probability as an irreducible fraction of the form numerator/denominator.   Constraints  1 <= Q <= 10^5 1 <=L, R<=10^7  1 <=K <=10^6    Example Input: 3 1 10 1 1 20 5 10 20 3  Output: 1/2 4/5 7/11Explanation: For the first test case, the numbers {1,3,5,7,9} are not divisible by the first prime number(K=1) - 2 in the range between 1 and 10(L and R). Hence the probability is 5/10 = 1/2 Warning: Large I/O, be careful with certain languages.

 Problem description. The Pragyan Bot Contest is to design a bot to do the following task. You are given an initial configuration of board of M rows and N columns and a target board of M rows and N columns, where each tile is either Blue or Red. Blue is denoted as '1' and Red is denoted as '0'. Your task is to make the initial configuration on the board to look like the target board. The bot can do one of the following functions in each step :  Select a column Ci. For each tile in that column change the blue color tiles to red and vice-versa. It takes one time unit to do this. Select any two rows and swap them. This operation takes zero time units   Find the minimum number of time units taken to change the board to the given configuration.  Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers M and N. Then 2 lines follows where the first line contains M space-separated strings of 0's and 1's each of length N where the strings represents the configuration of M rows of the initial board. Then the next line contains M space-separated strings of 0's and 1's each of length N where the strings represents the configuration of M rows of the target board   Output  For each test case, output a single line containing the minimum time taken to match the boards. If it is not possible for the bot to match them, then output -1.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 150 1 ≤ M ≤ 150 1 ≤ N ≤ 50     Example Input: 1 2 3 110 001 000 111  Output: 1  Explanation For the first test case the robot can switch the 3rd column of the initial board and match it with the final board.

Aditya is playing a game with Dhivya. There is a weighing scale with 2 pans. There are also N weights numbered from 1 to N in a queue, owned by Dhivya. Aditya initially has no weights with him. Aditya processes the weights owned by Dhivya one-by-one. At any point of time, he weighs the weights that he owns against the next weight in queue. For example, if after 2 iterations, Aditya somehow owned the weights numbered 1 and 2 of weight 30 and 50 respectively, and the weights with Dhivya (numbered 3,4 and 5) are 90,80, and 100, then in the next iteration Aditya weighs his weights (30+50=80) against the next weight in queue (90). So in this iteration, Aditya loses to Dhivya Aditya does not want to lose to Dhivya in any iteration. That is, in every iteration, he always wants that the total weights with him outweighs the next weight in queue. In iterations when this is not possible, he pays Dhivya the amount for the next weight in queue and adds that weight to his collection; then both agree that Aditya won that iteration. He has the option to buy the next weight in queue from Dhivya, even if he can win that iteration. Obviously, he must buy the first weight, since initially he has no weights with him. Find out the minimum money he needs to spend such that he wins all the iterations.   Input The first line will contains the number of weights N, all of which are with Dhivya in the beginning. The subsequent N lines contain 2 integers each : the price for that weight (Pi) and the weight (Wi).   Output Print one integer - the minimum amount Aditya needs to pay to Dhivya.   Constraints 1<=N<=100 1<=Pi<=10 1<=Wi<=1,000,000,000   Example Input : 3 3 10 1 5 8 12 Output : 4 Explanation : Aditya has to buy the first weight (total sum payable = 3). He can win the next iteration, but then he will have to buy the 3rd weight to win the game (total sum payable =3+8 =13). Instead he could have bought the second weight and then he would have won the game with total sum payable = 3+1 =5.

Input The first line of input contains a single integer 'n', denoting the total number of inequalities. Each of the next 'n' lines contain 2 space separated integers ti and vi. ti denotes the type of inequality and vi denotes the value on the right hand side of the inequality.   Output Output two space separated integers, the first integer denoting the maximum number of inequalities which are satisfied for some value of 'x', and the second integer denoting the minimum value of 'x' for which the maximum number of inequalities are satisfied.   Example  Input: 4 1 10 2 9 3 7 4 4  Output: 3 7  Constraints: 1 <= n <= 100000 1 <= ti <= 4 1 <= vi <= 10^18   Explanation: The given inequalities are: 1) x > 10, 2) x < 9, 3) x = 7, 4) x != 4. For x=7, the inequalities 2), 3) and 4) are satisfied. 
Chakra is a young and dynamic entrepreneur, who is developing rapidly as a successful hotelier. He owns the Quickbyte chain of restaurants, 'M' of which are fully functional now. He divides each day into 'N' time slots. For each time slot 'j', in every restaurant 'i', there are Aij waiters and Bij customers. Being a quality conscious person, he wants each waiter to handle atmost one customer in a given time slot. Since he is really busy, in a day each restaurant is open only during one of the time slots. Since the hunger and demand for food varies during the day, the price which the customer is willing to pay varies, and is given by Cij for a restaurant 'i' during a time slot 'j'. Given the values of Aij, Bij and Cij, find the maximum profit which Chakra can make in a day.   Input The first line of input contains an integer 't', denoting the number of test cases.  For each testcase, the first line contains 2 space separated integers 'M' and 'N'.  Each of the next 'M' lines contains 'N' integers. The i^th integer on the j^th line denotes the value of Aij Each of the next 'M' lines contains 'N' integers. The i^th integer on the j^th line denotes the value of Bij Each of the next 'M' lines contains 'N' integers. The i^th integer on the j^th line denotes the value of Cij  Output For each test case output one value, denoting the maximum profit which Chakra can make in a day.   Example  Input: 1 2 3 1 2 3 3 2 1 3 2 1 1 2 3 4 5 2 3 1 6  Output: 16  Constraints: t ≤ 50 1 ≤ M,N ≤ 100 1 ≤ Aij, Bij ≤ 5000 0 ≤ Cij ≤ 10^9   Explanation: Test case 1: By opening the first restaurant at time slot 2 and second restaurant at time slot 3, Chakra makes a profit = 2*5 + 1*6 = 16. Note that although there are 3 customers for the second restaurant at time slot 3, since there is only 1 waiter, only 1 customer can be served. 
Nivash and Bhoopathi play a game of memory, which goes as follows: There is a tree containing 'N' nodes, all of which are initially uncoloured.  In the game, Nivash has 2 moves:  1) Command: Color a particular node with a given color.  2) Query: Ask Bhoopathi if the path from node 'a' to node 'b' (both inclusive), is monochromatic or not.(i.e Whether all nodes on the path have the same color).    Nivash can do these steps in any order he wishes and he colors each node atmost once. Whenever Nivash puts forth a 'Query' at Bhoopathi, Bhoopathi has to recollect the colouring of the tree and reply either "YES" or "NO". Can your help Bhoopathi answer these queries?    Input The first line of input contains an integer 'N', denoting the number of nodes in the tree.  The next 'N-1' lines contain 2 space separated integers 'u' and 'v', denoting an edge between vertex 'u' and vertex 'v'. The next line contains an integer 'Q', denoting the number of inputs (commands and queries) which Nivash wants to give. The next 'Q' lines contain 3 space separated integers 'x', 'a', 'b'. If 'x' is 1, it denotes a command to color node 'a' with a color 'b'. If 'x' is 2, it denotes a query and Bhoopathi should answer if the path from node 'a' to node 'b' (both inclusive), is monochromatic or not. All vertices of the tree are 0 based.   Output For each query, output "YES" or "NO" (quotes for clarity), denoting whether the path from node 'a' to node 'b' (both inclusive), is monochromatic or not.  Output "NO", even if all nodes on the path from node 'a' to node 'b' (both inclusive) are uncolored.   Example  Input: 3 0 1 1 2 7 1 0 11 2 0 1 2 0 2 1 2 12 1 1 11 2 0 1 2 0 2  Output: NO NO YES NO  Constraints: 1 ≤ N ≤ 100000 1 ≤ Q ≤ 200000 1 ≤ color value ≤ 30.   Explanation: Initially node '0' is colored with color '11', so path between node '0' and node '1' is not monochromatic. Hence, the answer is "NO". The same explanation holds for the path between node '0' and  node '2'. Then node '2' is colored with color '12' and node '1' with color '11'. Now, all nodes on the path between node '0' and node '1' are colored with only one color ('11'), so the answer is "YES". The path between node '0' and node '2' has 2 colors ('11' and '12'), hence the answer is "NO". 
What is the expected number of nodes in a trie when 'N' words, each of length 'L' are inserted into it. The words are made up only of 0's and 1's. The words may be repeated and all possible permutations of words are equally likely. Initially the trie consists of only one node (root node).   Input The first line of input contains an integer 't', denoting the number of test cases. Each of the next 't' lines contain 2 space separated integers 'N' and 'L'.   Output For each test case, output one floating point value denoting the expected number of nodes in the trie. Output the values rounded off to 2 decimal places. Always print 2 digits after the decimal point. To know more about tries visit here.   Example  Input: 2 1 3 2 2  Output: 4.00 4.25  Constraints: t ≤ 25 1 ≤ N ≤ 300 1 ≤ L ≤ 300   Explanation: Test case 1: There are 8 possible words of length 3. Which ever word is inserted into the trie, we get only 4 nodes. 
 Harsha is given 9 integers a1, a2, a3, .... a9. This denotes that he is given a1 1's, a2 2's,......a9 9's. Let 'x' = (a1  + a2 + ...a9). Now, Harsha makes all possible 'x' digit numbers by using these given digits. Let S be the set of all such numbers which he makes. Now he constructs a directed graph containing |S| nodes, in which each node denotes a unique number from the set. For all numbers u,v belonging to S, there is a directed edge from node 'u' to node 'v in the graph iff u>v. It is easy to note that we obtain a directed acyclic graph. Whats more, the edges of the graph are weighted. The weight of an edge joining node 'u' and node 'v' is equal to u+v. Now, Deepak decides to test Harsha's memory and gives him 'Q' queries. Each query consists of two numbers 'u', 'v' (u>v, both belonging to the set S). For each query Harsha must provide the following answers: 1) How many distinct paths are there from node 'u' to node 'v' in the graph. 2) For each distinct path 'i' from node 'u' to node 'v', let Si denote the sum of weights of all edges on this path. Calculate the value of sum(Si), for every distinct path 'i' from node 'u' to node 'v'.   Input  The first line of input contains 9 integers a1, a2, ....a9. The second line contains a single integer 'Q', denoting the number of queries. Each of the next 'Q' lines contain 2 numbers 'u' and 'v'.   Output  For each query, output 2 space separted integers denoting the number of distinct paths and sum of weights of all paths respectively. Since the output can be large, output these quantities modulo 1000000007.  Two paths (v1, v2, .... vm) and (u1, u2, .... un) are distinct if: 1) m != n 2) m = n, there exists some index 'k' (1 ≤ k ≤ m) such that vk != uk  Example  Input: 2 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 311 113  Output: 2 1110  Constraints: 1 ≤ (a1  + a2 + .... a9) ≤ 500 1 ≤ Q ≤ 20 ai ≥ 0   Explanation: Test case 1: The set S for the above problem is {311, 113, 131}. The edges of the graph are 311->131, 311->113, 131->113. There are 2 distinct paths from 311 to 113, namely (311->131->113) and (311->113). The sum of weights of edges on path-1 = (311+131)+(131+113) = 686. For path-2, the sum of weights of edges = (311+113) = 424. Therefore, answer  = 686 + 424 = 1110. 
Vikas is the chief interior designer incharge of the Taj Palace, Mumbai. He wants to make an impressive and colourful pattern in the courtyard. Importing exotic tiles has become very difficult after the Mumbai terror attacks, and therefore Vikas has only 4 kinds of tiles to choose from:  A      B      C       D ==    ==    ==    == XX    X     X      X XX    X     XX   Any rotation of above tiles is also permitted.  Each tile is available in 'k' different colors, and there's an infinite supply of all tiles. The courtyard has dimensions 2 * 'n'. Vikas wants to tile the courtyard in such a way that no two adjacent tiles have the same color. Two tiles are considered adjacent if they share a common side. Two tilings are considered different if: 1) The arrangement of tiles is different. 2) There is atleast 1 position (1*1 square) which has different colors in the two arrangements.  Can you help Vikas find the number of different ways in which he can tile the courtyard, subject to the above conditions?    Input  The first line of input contains a single integer 't', denoting the number of test cases. Each of the next 't' lines contains 2 space separated integers 'n' and 'k'.   Output For each test case output one integer, denoting the number of different ways in which the courtyard can be tiled. Two tiles are considered adjacent if they share an edge. Two tiles which just share a common point are not considered adjacent.    Example  Input: 2 1 1 1 2  Output: 1 4  Constraints: t ≤ 1000 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 1 ≤ k ≤ 1000   Explanation: Test case 1: There is only 1 way to tile the courtyard, by using a 2*1 tile. Test case 2: Let '1' and '2' be the available colors. The grid can be tiled in 4 ways - 1) place one 2*1 tile of color '1', 2) place one 2*1 tile of color '2', 3) Place two 1*1 tiles (color '1' above and color '2' below), 4) Place two 1*1 tiles (color '2' above and color '1' below) 
 Sumit specialises in sorting algorithms, and Abhishek decides to test Sumit's coding skills. An array of 'n' numbers a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1] is given. Abhishek gives a sequence of inputs of the form "v i j". Each input is either a query or an update (query if 'v' is 0, update otherwise).  For any input of the form "0 i j" ,Sumit's output should be as follows:  If the subarray a[i], a[i+1], ... a[j] is unsorted, output 0.  If the subarray a[i], a[i+1], ... a[j] is sorted in non-descending order, output 1.  If the subarray a[i], a[i+1], ... a[j] is sorted in non-ascending order, output 2.  If the subarray a[i], a[i+1], ... a[j] is sorted in both non-ascending and non-descending order (i.e, if all the elements in the  range are equal), output 3.  Any other input "v i j" (v!=0) should be treated as an update, as follows:  For each element in the subarray a[i], a[i+1], ... a[j], Sumit has to replace the element a[k] with v-a[k].  Sumit is really tired and does not want to write a program. Can you write a program for Sumit, which responds to Abhishek's instructions?     Input The first line of input contains 2 space separated integers 'n' and 'q'. The second line contains 'n' integers a[0], a[1], ....., a[n-1]. Each of the next 'q' lines contain 3 integers 'v', 'i', 'j'.   Output  For each query, output a single integer 0, 1, 2 or 3, denoting the answer.    Example  Input: 4 5 3 -2 -5 1 1 1 3 0 0 3 0 0 2 0 2 3 0 0 1  Output: 0 1 2 3  Constraints: 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000 1 ≤ q ≤ 100000 -5000 ≤ a[i] ≤ 5000 -5000 ≤ v ≤ 5000   Explanation Initial array is {3, -2, -5, 1}. After first update, the array will be {3, 3, 6, 0}. Now, from indices '0' to '3', it is unsorted. From indices '0' to '2', it is sorted in non-descending order. From indices '2' to '3', it is sorted in non-ascending order. Between indices '0' and '1', the values are equal. 
Its Chef's Birthday and his friends are demanding him for treat. So he went to the shop to buy N gift packets (one for each friend). Each gift packet bought from shop contains some number of chocolates in it.  Chef believes in equality i.e. all gift packets should contain equal number of chocolates in it. So Chef thought to rearrange the chocolates, one by one, such that all gift packets should contain equal number of chocolates afterwards.  But since its Chef's Birthday he wants to do this in minimum number of chocolates moved. Help Chef to do this task and you might also get treat from Chef :p  Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of gift packets. The second line contains N space-separated integers C1, C2, ..., CN denoting the number of chocolates in i^th gift packet.   Output  For each test case, output a single line containing number of minimum moves required such that each gift packet contain equal number of chocolates. If it is not possible to do so then print "No Treat".   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ Ci ≤ 10^6   Example Input: 2 4 5 2 4 5 6 5 2 4 1 7 5  Output: 2 5  Explanation Example case 1. Chef can move one chocolate from 1st gift packet to 2nd gift packet (distribution looks like 4 3 4 5). Now in next move he moves one chocolate from last gift packet to 2nd gift packet. Final distribution looks like 4 4 4 4 which took place in 2 moves. 
One day Alice visited Byteland to purchase jewels for her upcoming wedding anniversary. In Byteland, every Jewelry shop has their own discount methods to attract the customers. One discount method called Buy1-Get1 caught Alice's attention. That is, Alice buys one jewel, then she can get one additional jewel with the same color without charge by Buy1-Get1. Alice lists the needed jewels as a string S, each letter denotes one jewel, and the same letters denote the same colors of jewels, and the different letters denote the different colors of jewels. The cost of each jewel is 1. Your task is to calculate the minimum cost for getting all the jewels Alice listed.  Input The first line of input contains a single line T, which represents the number of test cases. Then T lines will follow, and each contains a string S, which represents the jewels Alice needed.  Output Output the minimum cost for each test case.  Constraints 1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ |S| ≤ 200, where |S| represents the length of the string S.  The string S is case sensitive, and will contain only English characters in the range [a-z], [A-Z].  Sample  Input: 4 ssss ssas sa s  Output: 2 3 2 1  Explanation In the first sample case, Alice needs 4 jewel of color s. One of the optimal way is the following: Buy the first s with cost 1, and she can get the second s without charge. Then buy the third s with cost 1, and she can get the last s without charge. In this case, she get 4 jewels with only cost 2. In the second sample case, Alice needs 3 jewels of color s and 1 jewel of color a. One of the optimal way is the following: Buy the second s with cost 1, and she can get the last s without charge. Then buy the a and the first s with cost 2. In this case, she get 4 jewels with only cost 3. In the third and fourth sample cases, she cannot save her money by using Buy1-Get1. 
  Walter white wants to buy a car, he does not care much about the type of car (sedan/hatchback/SUV) nor the power that the car has, all he cares about is how much the car will cost him, since he has loads of money , he wants to buy the most expensive car available in the market, but there is a catch! The tax percentages for each car vary and Walt wants to buy the most expensive car (including the tax costs), since there is a large selection of cars to choose from and he is busy 'cooking' for most of the time, he knocks on your door (because he is the one who knocks) one fine day and asks you to give him an efficient solution for his problem. If two cars have the same cost after adding the tax costs, Walt wants the car which has higher base price. Note: There is no case where the base price and interest rates of any two cars are the same   Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each line contains :N denoting the number of cars The next  N  lines contain  string S denoting the car name The cost of the car C The tax percentage to be paid for that particular car i   Output For each test case, output a single line containing the name of the car that you have to suggest for walter to buy  Constraints 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000 1 ≤ N ≤ 100 1 ≤ S ≤ 20 100 ≤ C ≤ 1000000 0 ≤ i ≤ 100    Example Input: 2 3 Ferrari $100000 20% Porsche $200000 10% Lamborghini $300000 10% 2 BMW $20000 50% Benz $15000 100%  Output: Lamborghini BMW    Explanation Example case 1. Lamborghini is the costliest car among the given cars Example case 2. The two cars turn out to be the same cost after taxes, but the base price of BMW is more 
Suraj, a software engineer from Mumbai just got placed in a software company in New Delhi. As, he has to relocate from Mumbai to Delhi, he decided to buy a house. Yeah price of houses have decreased after Narendra Modi became PM of India. He decided to buy a house in a locality which has burger points at each corner. As the streets are only one way there is a heavy traffic jam and it take time to Suraj to reach burger point. Modi just declared that he will convert some streets connecting these burger points to two way roads. Some conversion cost is associated with each street. It will cost lot of money to convert all streets to two way streets so Modi  wanted these conversion in such a way that total cost of conversion is minimized keeping in mind that all burger points are connected with two way roads. Suraj after coming to know about this idea decided to buy a house in a two way street. But not all streets will be two way. So, he ask you to tell him if he should buy house in a particular street or not. As there can be more than one conversion plan, help Suraj to decide if he should buy house in that street or not. You will be given m queries by Suraj. Your task is to tell for how many queries will the answer be yes. Return ans in the form of a/b where a is the no. of queries for which ans is yes and b is total number of queries. (gcd(a,b) should be 1).  There will be n burger points and k streets joining them.  Input First line of input contain 1 integer t denoting no.of test cases. Next line of input will contain 2 positive integers n and k where n is the no.of burger points and k is the no.of streets connecting them.  Burger points are numbered 1 to n. Next k line contain 3 positive integers x, y, cst, each denoting street between x and y and cst is the cost associated with that street. Next line contains 1 integer m denoting number of queries. Next m line contains 2 integers c,d.  Output Output answer in the form as specified in ques. For more clarity see sample test case.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 15 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000 1 ≤ cst ≤ 100 k = min(1001, (n*(n-1)/2)) - n) + n 1 ≤ q ≤ k   Example Input: 1 7 10 1 2 5 1 4 3 1 5 12 1 6 5 4 5 1 5 6 2 5 3 1 3 6 16 4 7 1 2 4 1 5 1 6 2 4 3 5 3 6 1 2  Output: 2/5  Explanation For the queries 2 and 3 there can be a two way road. Hence, total number of yes are 2 and total queries are 5 and hence the answer is 2/5.

 Note: For Turbo C++, select "Text" as your language Problem Description: Dr Watson loves to post the cases solved by Sherlock Holmes online. Every story that is put on his blog is mysterious and exciting. This time there is a twist, Sherlock Holmes has solved the mystery all on his own and refuses to tell Dr Watson who is the person that is guilty. Frustrated by this Watson posts all the clues and the events online. He expects someone intelligent enough to solve the case and let him know, how sherlock solved it. Although this information is not readily available and is in an encrypted form. He does so, so that all the people do not come to know that Watson is still puzzled, and out of the few who do he expects an answer…   The following was posted on his blog:   okius,uoeecjoenmwmro* nhtdhbpwnroonxhs.slu* eotdirajeerhatio'oot* slienenuibnnndsnwnct* nmnngadsgrecdad.hbkh* oegatklthorrpyohirhe* wsbshioibt.iahoecooi* ywynrnonohtmuorbhtln* naaoogktrehslltrohmc* isfwuieihreocmhofeei* giibgtdmosinreaktrsd* hnrah.oeorr,istehsqe* thelhhutdunmmgryesun* ,i.liotoknaasoeothet* ssacsltsiamrotauhos?* hhlawmhedreknadrrut** eolmieeesosc.n'weli** ruoenswtwuwrto?iedo** lsfcdgihhneihtcncsn** oearoonrodrmeerdrha** cssawtdewaesnoioieb**  The place where he used to write “The Game is On”, he wrote ”tas* hmo* een* gi**”.

Mike is a naughty child. He never takes his classes seriously. He usually plays mathematical games in his boring lectures. This time he started writing an infinite GP of positive numbers with a common ratio of 2.  1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128..... He named this series as M-series and made a game.

Gandalf’s secret mark on the door did its job. One by one, all the dwarves entered Bilbo’s house and Thorin and his band of dwarves took their places. Bilbo, for one, was as confused as one could be as to what was going on. There were so many dwarves in his house, singing songs about reclaiming the lonely mountain and helping themselves with all the food in his house. Anyone else would probably have lost their cool and asked the uninvited guests to leave but not Bilbo. He had always been a brilliant host and it was going to stay that way. He decided to help but he’d be smart about it. Bilbo figured that he’d have to clean up on his own afterwards, so he came up with a scheme that would allow him to use very few glasses. Since everyone could not fit at the table at once, they had supper in turns and the once a dwarf completed his supper and went out, his glass was available to be used by a new dwarf entering the room. Bilbo marked the time at which each person sat down to eat and got up. Now, assuming that there’s no time lag between a person getting up from the table another taking his place and assuming that the glass can also be used by the other person right away, what is the minimum number of glasses that Bilbo should set at the table so that everyone can have their supper. Let ‘n’ be the total number of uninvited dwarfs and let ‘s’ and ‘t’ be the starting and finishing time respectively for each one of them, then output the minimum number of glasses at the table that would do the job.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer t denoting the number of testcases. Every testcase consists of the following lines: The first line contains an integer n denoting the number of uninvited dwarfs. The next n lines contain two space separated integers denoting the starting time s and finishing time f respectively. NOTE: s will always be smaller than f  Output For every testcase output a single line containing an integer denoting the minimum number of glasses required.  Constraints 1 <= t <= 5 1 <= n <= 1000000 1 <= s, f <= 10^18  Example  Input: 1 7 1830 1925 1920 2000 1915 1950 1845 1930 1850 1855 1800 1900 1905 1945  Output: 5 
In a distant future, the world has reduced down to very few cities, all hostile to each other. So much so, that each city built its own roads to other cities, if needed and these roads were one way roads. No one dares to walk on someone else's and even though teleportation is possible, the dangers involved are too great for anyone to risk their lives. With time, however, certain cities became allies and certain blocks were formed. Within each block, trade was possible between any two cities by road but teleportation was used to reduce the travelling time to zero. Bilbo wants to reach a city 'D' (destination) and he's at city 'S' in the shortest time possible. However, Bilbo has a map that's a few years old and represents the travelling time between two cities before the blocks described above were formed. Your job is to find what the actual minimum possible time to travel from a city S to a city D for Bilbo.  Input The first line of input will consist of two integers n and q. n represents the number of cities in the old map and q is the number of queries. The next few lines of the input consist of 3 integers, i, j, k, which represents a one way road from city i to city j with travelling time of k. The roads information ends with an input of -1   -1   -1. The next q lines contain 2 integers s   d. s represents the source city and d represents the destination city.  Output For each query you have to output a single line containing an integer denoting the minimum time possible between the two cities. If no path is possible between the two cities, output “Unreachable” (quotes only for clarity).  Constraints 2 <= n <= 50 0 <= i, j < n 1 <= k <= 100000 1 <= q <= 100000 0 <= s, d < n  Example  Input: 6 5 0 1 2 1 2 10 0 3 9 4 5 2 4 1 15 2 4 20 3 4 8 -1 -1 -1 0 1 0 5 3 4 0 3 4 5 Output: 2 4 8 9 2 
Balin is stuck in a labyrinth beneath the lonely mountain and roof is about to collapse. Add a fire breathing dragon to the mix and it’s safe to say that he is desperate to get out of there as quickly as possible. Your task is to help him find the path to get out this pickle! The labyrinth is represented as a m-by-n matrix with Balin’s position marked as ‘s’ and the exit marked as ‘f’. Cells are marked either as ‘b’ or ‘w’. The ‘w’ marked cells represent traps in the labyrinth, designed to kill and so Balin cannot choose those cells in his path to get out. The only safe positions are the ones that are marked with b’s. Your program must output the matrix containing ‘b’ in each cell on the required path and ‘-‘ (ASCII Code 45) in the other cells. In case there is no way for Balin to survive, output “The path doesn’t exist.”. There is only one path to come out of the labyrinth but the labyrinth contains false paths which Balin must avoid because they will eventually lead to  a trap.  Input The first line of the input will consist of an integer t representing the number of testcases. Every testcase consists of the following lines: The first line contains two integers n and m representing the number of rows and columns respectively. Next n lines contain m letters denoting the map of the labyrinth.  Output For each testcase output an n X m matrix that has ‘s’, ‘f’ at the same positions as in the input matrix and a path represented by b’s which is path from s to f and for all other positions output a ‘–‘. If no such path exists, output "The path doesn't exist." (quotes only for clarity). NOTE: Balin cannot move diagonally  Constraints 1 <= T <=10 2 <=n,  m<=1000  Example  Input: 2 6 5 bbbbw bwwfw bbbww bwwww bbbbw wwwbs  4 4 bbbw wwfw bwww bbbs   Output: bbbb- b--f- b---- b---- bbbb- ---bs The path doesn't exist. 
Two strings can be shuffled by interspersing their letters to form a new string, much like two piles of cards can be shuffled to form a single pile. For example, the strings HELLO and WORLD can be shuffled to form HWEOLRLLOD, or HEWORLLLDO, or perhaps simply HELLOWORLD. It is not a shuffle if the original order of letters is not preserved. For example, the D in WORLD cannot ever appear before the R after being shuffled. This means that EHLLOWRDLO, for instance, is not a shuffle of HELLO and WORLD, even though it contains all the original letters. A string is a shuffle of twins if it can be formed by shuffling two identical strings. For example, ABACBDECDE is a shuffle of twins because it can be formed by shuffling ABCDE and ABCDE. DBEACBCADE is not a shuffle of twins because it cannot be formed by shuffling two identical strings. All the strings will contains only UPPERCASE letters. In case, no twins exist output “Twins don’t exist” (quotes only for clarity). All strings will contain only UPPERCASE letters.  Input The first line of the input will is integer T denoting the number of testcases. Next T lines contain the shuffled string S. The input string can contain upto N letters.  Output For every testcase, output a single line containing one of the two identical strings that make up the input string. If the no such pair of identical strings exist, print "Twins don't exist". (quotes only for clarity).  Constraints 1 <= T <= 10 2 <= N <= 10^6  Example  Input: 2 ABACBDECDE DBEACBCADE  Output: ABCDE Twins don't exist 
Do you like Treasure Hunts? I like treasure hunts. Love ‘em. And TROIKA 2013 has the best one ever in ‘MIST’ (apps.facebook.com/mist_troika). Just like a normal treasure hunt, you are given several clues and you have to get the right answer to progress to the next level and so on, until you reach the ultimate prize! But the organizers have learnt that a lot of users are not progressing even after figuring out the correct answer; it seems ‘someone’ forgot to code in ‘possible variants of the correct answer’ for each level. For example, if “Sachin Tendulkar” happened to be the answer to a particular level, “Tendulkar” or “tendulkar” or “sachin tendulkar” wasn’t accepted as correct. This is what you have to rectify. Given the expected answer ‘S’, your job is to modify the answer-verification-system to be able to allow acceptable variants of ‘S’. If the user enters an acceptable variant ,terminate the program. You can assume that the user is intelligent enough so that he will enter the answer in an order specified by the string S i.e he will not enter anything like “Tendulkar Sachin” if the answer is “Sachin Tendulkar” however he can enter “Tendulkar”.  Input The first line of the input contains a string S. The next few lines contain the input string P entered by the user.  Output For every line entered by the user output “Yes” if the string is acceptable and “No” if it is not. (quotes only for clarity).  Contraints 1 <= length of S and P <= 10000  Example  Input 1: Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar Sach Ram sAcH Tendul sach Tendulkar Sachin Ram Tendulkar SAChin TENduLkaR  Output 1: No No No No No Yes  Input 2: Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar Sach Ram sAcH Tendul sach Tendulkar Sachin Ram Tendulkar Ramesh TENduLkaR  Output 2: No No No No No Yes 
We the students belonging to IIST, have found an electronic device for space applications. In order to standardize, for measuring the component value we decided to opt the resistance color coding algorithm. The electronic component contains four bands of colors. Now the electronic department needs your help for measuring the component value if the four color bands are given.Since it was invented by a student GUNTUR, the component value follows the unit name 'Guntur' with a space between them. NOTE: Excluding tolerance color bands like gold and silver  Input Input contains four strings of colors of resistance color coding with spaces between them.

 The Chef is having a dinner party and invited over all his friends.  His guests being fairly health conscious have exact protein requirements, and The Chef wishes to oblige them all.   The Chef will cook dishes for each individual guest using the ingredients in his kitchen.  Each ingredient has a specific amount of protein. The complete dish will have a protein content value equal to the sum of the protein contents of the individual ingredients. To cook a dish, The Chef can use any of the ingredients which appear on his shelf, but only in the order which they appear on the shelf.  The same ingredient may appear multiple times, and can also be used as many times as it appears.   There are multiple ways to choose ingredients following the rules given above. However, The Chef is only interested in choosing the set of ingredients that appear first in a lexicographically ordered list of ingredients which satisfy the protein constraints.  Your job is to write a program that helps The Chef figure out which dish to serve!   Input The first line of input contains t, the number of guests invited by The Chef (about 200).   Each test consists of three lines:  The first line consists of one integer 1 ≤ k ≤ 26 (the number of  unique  ingredients on the shelf) and than k space-separated positive integers from the set {1, 2, ... ,15} describing the protein content for each ingredient in an alphabetically sorted list of unique ingredients.  (the first protein value corresponds with ingredient a, the second corresponds with the protein value for ingredient b, and so on). The second line contains L - a sequence of lower-case letters of the Latin alphabet (at most 1000) which signify the name of the ingredient. The third line contains one positive integer S which specifies the exact protein requirement of this guest (1 < S < 500).   Output For each testcase either output the sequence of ingredients as described above, or the word 'IMPOSSIBLE' if no such subsequence exists.   Example  Input: 3 5 12 1 12 4 4 acccdadceb 2 3 5 4 6 abcbacbabcc 15 2 3 4 baba 7  Output: IMPOSSIBLE aaa ab   Comments: For the first guest we have five ingredients: a, b, c, d, e with protein values 12 1 12 4 4 respectively. To achieve a total protein value equal to 2 we need two ingredients b. But there is only one, thus the answer is IMPOSSIBLE. For the second guest we can achieve a total protein value of 15 with the ingredients taken as: abc, bca, acb, cab, cba, bac, or aaa. Of these, the first according to lexicographic order is aaa.  For the third guest, out of the two possibilities, ab is the correct answer. 
  The Chef was an exceptionally great student, but did not write any of his exams well, and used to fail a lot receiving zeros in a lot of problems. This caused the Chef to have a fascination towards zeros.  The Chef wanted to write a program to help him find the number to trailing zeros. Let there be a whole number N such that N! (N factorial) when written in base 10 (decimal notation) ends in P Zeroes. The chef wants to find the smallest N which produces P Trailing Zeroes.  Note: It is assured that N exists for values of P tested.  Input The first line consists of T number of test cases. Then T lines follow each taking the input P.    Output >Your program has to print the number N for each test case in T lines.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 0 ≤ P ≤ 10^9     Example Input: 1 2  Output: 10    Explanation Test case 1. 10!= 3628800 (Two trailing zeroes). 
  Chef is long overdue for his laundry and is trying to figure out how to use a washing machine. He asks his friend Raseac to help him. Raseac loves riddles though. He accepts to help the chef out but asks him to solve or decode his riddle before he assists in the operation of the washing machine. He said:  I came, I saw, I conquered methinks is 'gagtgbgtglct'. [venividivici==gagtgbgtglct] So tell me my dear Chef, what you think about my other riddles?  Input The first line consists of T number of test cases. Then T lines follow, each taking string of characters as an input (not more than 1000 characters). Do not consider any spaces between the characters.  Output The decoded string has to be shown as the output for all the T test cases. Tips: Raseac, a funny name, dont you think?    Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10     Example Input: 1 gagtgbgtglct  Output: venivedivici   
Smugglers are becoming very smart day by day. They use SMS to communicate with each other. Police can often intercept their messages and bust them. Now they have developed a new technique of sending their messages from one smuggler to another. In their new technology, they are sending their messages in a number format. This format represents the way that numbers and characters are padded on mobile’s keypad. One smuggler sends a text message to the second smuggler, using the numbers corresponding to the letters on the keypad. When the receiving smuggler gets the message, he simply opens the “create text message” function in his mobile and types the number string. This way the receiver finally reads the original message.   1 2ABC 3DEF   4GHI 5JKL 6MNO   7PQRS 8TUV 9WXYZ   * 0[SPACE] #    For Example: 6999066263304447777077766622337778 -----> message sent by the first smuggler. my name is robert---------> message decoded by the second smuggler. Where ‘0’ denotes the "space". But for word monkey 6#666#665533999 this string will be sent by the smuggler one Here ‘# ‘ denotes that if smuggler watches ‘#’ then it means character previous to # is on the same key to the character after the ‘#’ and smuggler has to wait for 2 seconds and then press the same key.  You have to make a program  that takes as input a numerically coded string as message and outputs decoded message.  Constraints  Smuggler can never send numbers in message text Output will always be in uppercase  Input First line T, will have a single integer having number of test cases followed by T lines of input each having CODED message send by smuggler 1.  Output For each test case, output a single line containing the message smuggler 2 will get after decoding.  Example  Input: 2 6999066263304447777077766622337778 6#666#665533999  Output: MY NAME IS ROBERT MONKEY  Explanation: By pressing ‘6’ (i.e. key’6’ one time) on the keypad, the mobile shows ‘m’ on display screen in write text message area. By pressing ‘999’ (i.e. key ‘9’ three times) on the keypad, the mobile shows ‘y’ on display screen in write text message area. By pressing ‘0’ (i.e. key ’0’ one time) on the keypad, the mobile shows ‘space’ on display screen in write text message area.

Output Print a single integer which is answer to the corresponding input.  Constraints 2<=N<=1000 1<=M<=100000 1<=A, B<=N  Example Input: 3 3 100 1 2 2 3 3 1 Output: 300  Input 4 2 50 1 2 2 3 Output 50    Explanation  In example 1, Student 1 will only accept gift if college gives gift to student 2 and for this it has to give gift to student 3 and student 3 will only accept gift if college gives gift to student 1. So college has to give gifts to all three students and cost of one gift is 100 rupees. So total cost is 300 rupees. 
Your friend Сhef has prepared a rectangular cake for you. Both of you want to divide the cake among yourselves. Your friend is generous enough to let you choose your share first. You have decided to take two pieces.For the first piece you make a rectangular cut (each side of this cut is parallel to the corresponding side of the cake) inside the cake. Now the cake have two pieces. You take the piece inside the rectangle cut. For the second piece, you make another rectangular cut (each side of this cut is parallel to the corresponding side of the cake) inside the cake. Now the cake again have two pieces. You take the piece inside the rectangle cut (note that this piece may not be rectangular, because of cut may cross an empty space that remains from the first piece, also it can be empty). Your friend will have the rest of the cake.Given the cuts determine the amount of cake that you will have. The amount is calculated as the sum of the areas covered by your pieces. The cake can be considered as a rectangle with the lower left corner at (0,0) and the upper right corner at (1001,1001).

The chef is preparing a birthday cake for one of his guests, and his decided to write the age of the guest in candles on the cake. There are 10 types of candles, one for each of the digits '0' through '9'. The chef has forgotten the age of the guest, however, so doesn't know whether he has enough candles of the right types. For example, if the guest were 101 years old, the chef would need two '1' candles and one '0' candle. Given the candles the chef has, your task is to determine the smallest positive integer that cannot be represented with those candles.  Input: Input will begin with an integer T≤100, the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a single line with exactly 10 integers, each between 0 and 8, inclusive. The first integer of each test case represents the number of '0' candles the chef has, the second integer represents the number of '1' candles the chef has, and so on.  Output: For each test case, output on a single line the smallest positive integer that cannot be expressed with the given candles.

It’s Halloween. Papa Smurf has received a lot of orders of candies. One day, while packing candies, he counted number of different ways he can pack candies in a box. Two ways are different if there exists a candy type for which its count in resulting boxes is different. Box has a property that they can contain only a fixed number of candies, neither less nor more. If Papa has three types for candies S1, S2, S3 and three boxes (B1, B2, B3), and he has to pack 6 candies in each box. Suppose he pack candies in a way that box has configuration B1{S1 = 1, S2 = 0, S3 = 5},  B2(S1 = 1, S2 S3 = 2) and B3(S1 = 1, S2 = 0, S3 = 5), then Box B1 and B2 are said to have different configuration, while Box B1 and B3 are same. But wait, there are some candies of which Smurfs are very fond of. So they gave you a list of such candies and the minimum number for each candy they want in their box. If a candy is not in this list, then Papa can pack any number (including zero) of this type of candy. Now help Papa in counting different number of ways he can pack candies in a box. Papa has infinite supply of each type of candies.  Input First line of input contain three integers, N M K, number of candies to be packed in a box, number of types of candies Papa had and length of candy's list which Smurfs give to him respectively. Then follow K lines. In each lines there are two integers, Si Xi, type of candy and minimum number of candy he has to put in each box (1 ≤ i ≤ M).  Output Find number of different ways Papa can pack candies in a box. As this number can be very large print answer modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7).  Constraints 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000000 1 ≤ M ≤ 1000000 0 ≤ K ≤ M 1 ≤ Si ≤ M 1 ≤ Xi ≤ 1000000  Example  Input #0: 4 2 1 1 2  Output #0: 3  Input #1: 5 3 2 1 2 2 1  Output #1: 6  Input #2: 5 1 1 3 6  Output #2: 0   Explanation Explanation for Sample Input #0: Papa has to pack 4 candies in a box, and he has two types of candies (S1, S2). This particular Smurf has mentioned that the box must have at least 2 candy of candy type #1. Then there are 3 number of ways of packing candies, represented by (S1 = 2, S2 = 2), (S1 = 3, S2 = 1), (S1 = 4, S2 = 0). Explanation for Sample Input #2: Papa has to pack 5 candies in a box, while according to list he has to pack at least 6 candies of candy type 3. And it is not possible. 
In primary classes, we were taught how to add multi-digit numbers from right-to-left one digit at a time. Many of us found the carry operation - in which a 1 is carried from one digit position to be added to the next - to be a significant challenge at that point of time. (You may find it challenging yet again if you can't solve this D:) Your task is to count the number of carry operations required for adding two multi digit numbers.  Please take care of constraints, they may be extremely large  Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The next T lines contain 2 space-separated integers denoting the first and the second number for addition operation.     Output  For each test case, output the number of carry operations required for the addition operation.     Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 1000 1 ≤ a,b ≤ 10^15     Example Input: 3 123 456 555 555 123 594  Output: 0 3 1 
You have a set of unique numbers. You are trying to find a subset of this set such that no two numbers in the subset have a common digit. There will of course be several such subsets. You are interested in the subset with the maximum sum. The sum of a subset is defined as the sum of the numbers in the subset. In fact, you are most interested in the cardinality - that is, the number of elements - of the subset with the maximum sum. Of course there may be several such subsets with the same maximum sum. Find the cardinality of the subset with the most elements among such sets. Refer to the explanation section for more clarity.  Input There will be several test cases. Each test case is described in two lines. The first line contains the number N, the number of numbers in the set given to you. The second line contains N space separated positive integers, A1, A2 ..., AN. The input is terminated by EOF.  Output For each test case, output a single line. The line should contain a single integer which denotes the cardinality of the set that satisfies all the requirements in the problem statement.  Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 100 1 ≤ Ai ≤ 1000000000 No two Ai's will be same. There will be at most 100 test cases.   Sample Input  3 7 17 10 2 12 29 3 1 2 12   Sample Output  2 1 1   Explanation In the first test case, the maximum sum possible is 17. There are two ways to achieve that sum. {7, 10}, with a cardinality of 2. {17}, with a cardinality of 1. Hence, the answer is 2, since it is more. In the second test case, we can select only 1 number due to the constraint that the numbers in the subset should not share any digits. The answer is of course 1, for the subset {29}. Note that a subset of cardinality 2 is possible, {1, 2}. But, its sum is only 3. The sum of the subset {12} is 12, which is the maximum possible. Hence the answer is the cardinality of the set {12}, which is 1. 
Problem Statement Today we are going to play a very interesting game. In the game N balls will be thrown at you horizontally from one side of the arena one after the other. Each ball will be thrown at a specified height above the ground and since the arena is gravity free, the balls will reach you at the same height that they were thrown. You will be given a bucket to catch these incoming balls from across the game arena. The bucket will be initially placed on the ground (Height=0). In order to catch a ball you must bring your bucket to the height at which the ball is coming. However, the bucket has a special property. Once it has been raised to a particular height, it can either stay at the same height or move higher in order to catch subsequent balls, but not move lower. Now assuming that you play optimally, we want you to find the maximum number of balls that you can catch in a given game. Input Specification  The first line of input contains an integer T, the number of games to be played. Then T test cases follow each containing 2 lines. The first line contains an integer N which is the number of balls that will be thrown in each game. The next line contains an array  of n integers specifying the predefined height at which the balls will be thrown. Thus the 1st value is the height at which the 1s ball will be thrown, the 2nd value is the height of the second ball and so on.   Constraints  1<=T<=100 1<=N<=1000 0<=Height at which each ball is thrown <=1000000   Output Specification  A single line for each game containing the maximum number of balls that you can catch in that game provided you play optimally.   Sample Input   2 6 1 8 5 6 7 9 6 7 5 3 1 9 5   Sample Output   5 2

 ACM International Collegiate     Programming Contest, Asia-Amritapuri Site, 2012 Saruman of Many Colours  '"For I am Saruman the Wise, Saruman Ring-maker, Saruman of Many Colours!"     'I looked then and saw that his robes, which had seemed white, were not so, but were woven of all colours.     And if he moved they shimmered and changed hue so that the eye was bewildered.' - Gandalf the Grey.  And so it was that Saruman decided to brand his Uruk-hai army with the many colours that he fancied. His method of branding his army was as follows. He straps his army of N Uruk-hai onto chairs on a conveyor belt. This conveyor belt passes through his colouring-room, and can be moved forward or backward. The Uruk-hai are numbered 0 to N-1 according to the order in which they are seated. Saruman wishes that the i'th Uruk-hai be coloured with the colour c[i]. Further, his colouring-room has space for exactly K chairs. Once the chosen K consecutive Uruk-hai are put into the room, a colour jet sprays all K of them with any fixed colour. The conveyor belt is not circular (which means that the N-1'th and the 0'th Uruk-hai are not consecutive). Note that Uruk-hai can be recoloured in this process.  Saruman wants to find out what is the minimum number of times that the jet needs to be used in order to colour his army in the required fashion. If it is not possible to colour the army in the required fashion, output -1.  Input (STDIN):  The first line contains the number of test-cases T. Each test case consists of 2 lines. The first line contains two space-separated integers, N and K. This is followed by a single line containing a string c of length N, describing the colours of the army. The i'th character of c denotes the colour of the i'th Uruk-hai in the army.  Output (STDOUT):  Output T lines, one for each test case containing the answer for the corresponding test case. Remember if it is not possible to colour the army as required, output -1.  Constraints:  1 <= T <= 50 1 <= K <= N <= 20,000 The string c has length exactly N and contains only the characters 'a',...,'z'.  Sample Input:   2 3 2 rgg 3 3 rgg  Sample Output:   2 -1  Notes/Explanation of Sample Input:  In the first test case, soldiers 0 and 1 can first be painted with 'r', and then soldiers 1 and 2 can be painted with 'g'. In the second test case, since N = K, all the soldiers will only have the same color.

Adam, an Adasaurus, works for a dish washing company. He comes across a pile consisting of N plates with a number tag each placed one on top of the other. He wishes to arrange the plates in the increasing order of the tag number. Though a plate can be pulled out of the stand, but it can only be returned to the top of the pile. Therefore, he can only sort the plates by repeatedly pulling out a plate and placing it on the top of the pile. The plates are labelled with numbers from 1 to N. So, they need to be ordered as (1, 2, ..., N), counting from the top. For example, if N = 3 and the starting order is (1, 3, 2), two moves are sufficient. First, pulling out the plate number 2 and placing it on top makes the order (2, 1, 3) and similarly with plate number 1 makes the final order (1, 2, 3). You need to help Adam sort the given starting order in minimum number of moves.  Input The first input line contains the integer N (N ≤ 300 000) and the subsequent N lines contain a single positive integer representing the order of Adam's plates from top to bottom of the pile. Also note that these integers 1, 2, 3,..., N appear exactly once.   Output Print the minimum number of moves required on a single line.   Example  Input: 3 1 3 2  Output: 2

In DDU's annual techno-cultural fest – Felicific, the Computer Engineering department is introducing a weird contest this time. In the contest, there are N registered participants, with heights h[1..N]. A coordinator speaks out a number K to all of them. The prize is awarded to any pair of participants whose heights add up to exactly K. The participants may form pairs however they like. Now, since you are to conduct this event and every event works with limited budgets, you need to find out whether, given the heights h[1..N] and the number K, is it possible for a pair to win? Assume that if there is such a pair, they will eventually find each other and claim the prize.  Note that exactly 2 participants are needed to claim the prize. A participant cannot choose himself as a partner, nor can more than 2 participants claim the prize if their heights add up to K  Input The first line contains 2 integers N and K denoting the number of registered participants and the required sum respectively. In the next line, there are exactly N integers denoting the heights of each participant.  Output Print "Yes" if such a pair exists, otherwise print "No" (without quotes).  Constraints  2 ≤ N ≤ 1000 0 ≤ K ≤ 2 * 10^18 0 ≤ h[i] ≤ 10^18   Example  Input 6 6 2 9 5 2 2 1  Output Yes   Explanation The pair (5, 1) can claim the prize.  
A robot is designed to move on a rectangular grid of M rows and N columns. The robot is initially positioned at (1, 1), i.e., the top-left cell. The robot has to reach the (M, N) grid cell. In a single step, robot can move only to the cells to its immediate east and south directions. That means if the robot is currently at (i, j), it can move to either (i + 1, j) or (i, j + 1) cell, provided the robot does not leave the grid. Now somebody has placed several obstacles in random positions on the grid, through which the robot cannot pass. Given the positions of the blocked cells, your task is to count the number of paths that the robot can take to move from (1, 1) to (M, N). Since the answer can get very large, output the answer modulo 1000000007.  Input The first line contains 3 integers M, N and P denoting the number of rows, number of columns and number of blocked cells respectively. In the next P lines, each line has exactly 2 integers i and j denoting that the cell (i, j) is blocked.  Output Output should contain a single integer, the number of paths modulo 1000000007.  Constraints  1 <= M, N <= 10^3 0 <= P <= M * N 1 <= i <= M 1 <= j <= N   Example  Input 4 3 2 3 3 3 1  Output 2   Explanation The only 2 possible paths are (1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (2, 2) -> (3, 2) -> (4, 2) -> (4, 3) and (1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 2) -> (3, 2) -> (4, 2) -> (4, 3)  
Somewhere out there, there are N islands numbered from 1 to N with no network connectivity. Communication is such a pain for the islands' dwellers. So the Kings of the islands go to nearby islands and decide to connect the islands with underwater cables for bidirectional communication. Initially no islands are connected with cables. You are required to process Q queries of the form:  t x y  where t denotes the type of query and can be 0 or 1. If t is 0, it denotes that a new cable is installed between islands x and y. When t is 1, you need to answer whether communication is possible between islands x and y. Two islands can communicate if a route can be established with the cables, i.e., the islands are directly or indirectly connected with cables.  Input The first line contains 2 integers N and Q denoting the number of islands and number of queries respectively. In the next Q lines, each line has a query of the form "t x y".  Output For each query of type 1, on separate lines print "Yes" if communication is possible or "No" otherwise (without quotes).  Constraints  2 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ Q ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ x, y ≤ N For each test case, x ≠ y   Example  Input 5 7 0 1 2 1 2 1 0 3 4 1 1 4 0 3 2 1 2 3 1 1 4  Output Yes No Yes Yes   Explanation Initially no islands are connected.  Join 1-2. Since 1 and 2 are connected, communication is possible. Join 3-4. Currently, 1-2 and 3-4 are the only cables. So no path from 1-4 is available. Join 2-3. So the connected islands are 1-2-3-4. Communication is possible between 2 and 3. Communication is possible between 1 and 4, due to the cables 1-2-3-4.  
Brachiosaurus is trying to become a detective by writing words in codes. It manipulates each word in a sentence by putting the letter 'z' after each vowel, followed by that very vowel. Eg- "belina" translates into "bezelizinaza" and "zazhiba" translates into "zazazhizibaza". A team of secret agents want to decode the sentences of Brachiosaurus.

 Today its going to be the Big Byteland FundRaiser Event. Many people who are to raise funds for their cause will be coming to this event. Carol has been having some financial issues with her NGO. Today she’ll have to convince some of the donors to donate for her NGO. As she has good links with the organisers, she managed to gather a description of the fixed donors disposition on the room (which is represented as an N × N square matrix), such that she knows in advance the amount each person will donate. She also knows that the room is divided into several parallel corridors, such that we will denote the j-th cell on corridor i, as [i][j].  Note that some donors can donate Carol, zero money or negative money(taking back what they consented to give already), as they may change their minds. There is just one donor at each cell of the matrix, except the cells [1][1] and [N][N]. To complete her fundraising, she must start on the top leftmost corner of the room (cell [1][1]), and finish on the bottom right corner (cell [N][N]), moving either to the cell directly in front of her on the same corridor (that is, moving from cell [r][c] to cell [r][c+1], where c+1 <= N) or to the cell in the next corridor directly in front of where she is (that is, moving from cell [r][c] to cell [r+1][c], where r+1 <= N). She will keep doing this until she reaches the end point of the room, i.e. last cell [N][N] on the last corridor. Carol will convince all visited cells with a donor. Carol wants to maximize her average donation at end. More specifically, if she passes K donors, each being on cell [i1][j1],  cell [i2][j2], ..., cell [iK][jK] respectively, then she wants to maximize (S[i1][j1] + S[i2][j2] + ... + S[iK][jK]) / K, where S[i][j] denotes the amount that the donor will give her on the cell [i][j]. Help her determine the best path she has to follow in order to maximize the average donations.   Input   The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.   The  first  line  contains  a  single  integer N denoting the number of size of matrix.  Each  of  the  next  N  lines  contains  N  space-separated  integers.   Note : The j-th integer S[i][j] in i-th line denotes the donation donated by the donor at cell [i][j]. Note that the cells [1][1] and [N][N] have no donors, so S[1][1] and S[N][N] will be 0.     Output For each test case, if the maximum possible average funds  Carol can obtain is negative, output a single line containing "No funds" (quotes for clarity). Otherwise, output the maximum possible average funds. The answer will be considered correct if it has an absolute error no more than 10^-6.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤  50 2 ≤ N ≤  100 -1000 ≤ S[i][j] ≤  1000 S[1][1] = S[N][N] =  0     Example Input: 2 2 0 -4 3 0 2 0 -4 -3  0  Output: 3.000000 No funds   
 Bob has given Scoop and Muck their new task. As of now, they are at House number X and Y. They have to fix some houses hi (X<=hi<=Y) in a straight lane. Things can be strange in their world. Only those houses have a problem and need to be fixed whose number is a N-Prime-divisors. A number is N-Prime-divisors if it has exactly N distinct prime divisors. For example number 4 is 1-Prime-divisors-number, number 42 is 3-Prime-divisors-number. So Scoop and Muck start from their places and move towards each other fixing all houses that are N-Prime-divisors. By time they meet, how many houses they have fixed in total(inclusive of the house where they meet)? Note :  A prime number is 1-Prime-Divisor because it is divisible by itself.   Input   The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.   Each test case contains three numbers X,Y and N separated by a space.      Output For each testcase, output on a separate line the number of N-Prime-divisors between X & Y.

  According to Wikipedia, an arithmetic progression (AP) is a sequence of numbers such that the difference of any two successive members of the sequence is a constant. For instance, the sequence 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, . . . is an arithmetic progression with common difference 2. For this problem, we will limit ourselves to arithmetic progression whose common difference is a non-zero integer. On the other hand, a geometric progression (GP) is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed non-zero number called the common ratio. For example, the sequence 2, 6, 18, 54, . . . is a geometric progression with common ratio 3. For this problem, we will limit ourselves to geometric progression whose common ratio is a non-zero integer. Given three successive members of a sequence, you need to determine the type of the progression and the next successive member.    Input Input description.  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows: The first line of each test case contains  three integers (−10, 000 < a1 , a2 , a3 < 10, 000) where a1 , a2 , and a3 are distinct.     Output   For each test case, you program must print a single line of the form:  XX v where XX is either AP or GP depending if the given progression is an Arithmetic or Geometric Progression. v is the next member of the given sequence. All input cases are guaranteed to be either an arithmetic or geometric progressions.      Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100     Example Input: 4 7 10 2 6 18  Output: AP 13 GP 54    Explanation Example case 1. It's an AP with difference 3 so next term is 13

  		Donald duck loves learning new algorithms. Today, he learned binary search and understood how it works on integer arrays sorted in non-decreasing order. His knack of getting into problems is famous, and he wrote his version of binary search algorithm as follows:  		binarySearch(int[] array, int lo, int hi, int key) 		{ 		    while (lo ≤ hi) 		    { 		        mid := random(lo, hi); 		        if a[mid] = key then 		            return mid; 		        else if (a[mid] > key) 		            hi := mid - 1; 		        else 		            lo := mid + 1; 		    } 		    return NOT_FOUND; 		}  		Yes! Donald did use random(lo, hi), instead of floor((lo+hi)/2) to calculate mid. The random(x, y) function returns a random integer between x and y, both inclusive. The problem did not stop here. Instead of giving arrays that are sorted in non-decreasing order as input, Donald was giving all sorts of integer arrays as input. 		Sure enough, the answers he got were far from expected. But he also noticed some interesting properties: searching for some numbers (which are already present in the array) in some arrays will always result in a successful search, but searching for some other numbers (which are also present in the array) in the same array need not always be successful. 		Formally, a number in an array (not necessarily sorted) is findable in the array, iff the number is guaranteed to be found in the array, using Donald's binary search, irrespective of whatever value the random function returns, whenever it is called. Given an integer array (not necessarily sorted) as input, Donald now wants to know the count of numbers that are findable in the array.   Input  		First line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases.  		Then 2T lines follow, two lines per test case.  		The first line of each test case contains a single integer N, the size of the array given as input to the function.  		The next line contains N unique space separated integers A[i], 0 ≤ i ≤ N-1   Output  		For each test case, print one integer (each on a new line) - the count of findable numbers in the array.   Constraints  		1 ≤ T ≤ 10  		1 ≤ N ≤ 10,000  		-1,000,000 ≤ A[i] ≤ 1,000,000   Example Input: 2 10 -40 -61 -50 -25 14 45 28 71 65 72 5 20 46 48 57 90  Output: 3 5  Explanation  Test Case 1: Here, only -25, 14 and 72 are findable in the array.  Test Case 2: Here, all 5 numbers are findable in the array.   
 		As part of his new invention, the gold cloning machine, Gyro Gearloose has to calculate nCr for large values of n (take a guess, why!!). But he has not added this part to the machine, as he has not yet been able to compute them efficiently. Now, Scrooge McDuck wants this machine completed by tomorrow. As Gyro is busy working on the aesthetics of the machine, he wants you to write and test the code for him.  		(nCr is the number of different ways of choosing r items from a group of n items.)   Input  		First line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases.  		Then T lines follow, one per test case.  		Each line contains two integers n and r.   Output  		For each test case, output a single line containing the value of nCr. Since the result can be too big, output the result modulo the prime number 1000000009 (10^9 + 9).   Constraints  		1 ≤ T ≤ 100  		0 ≤ n ≤ 200,000  		0 ≤ r ≤ n   Example Input: 3 10 5 100 50 0 0  Output: 252 933591892 1  Explanation  Test Case 1: The value of 10C5 is 252.  Test Case 2: The value of 100C50 is 100891344545564193334812497256. The result is larger than 1000000009. So, when reduced modulo 1000000009, it becomes 933591892.  Test Case 3: The value of 0C0 is 1.  
 		Mrs. Beakley was teaching her grand-daughter Webby some math. Today, Mrs. Beakley taught how to evaluate (possibly very large) expressions involving numbers and binary operators. Mrs. Beakley also gave Webby some homework. But Huey, Dewey and Louie wants Webby to join them for a game of Baseball. Help Webby complete her homework. 		Webby, being a brilliant duck, can handle expressions of any size. But Webby understood nothing in today's class, thanks to the teaching abilities of Mrs. Beakley. As of now, Webby can solve any expression, if it is well-formed. A well-formed expression is an expression in which, each binary operator, together with its operands (possibly other expressions) are enclosed in a pair of parenthesis. The number of pairs of parenthesis must match exactly the number of binary operators (not one more, not one less). 		Your task is to transform a given expression into a well-formed expression.   Input  		The only line of the input consists of a valid mathematical expression. This expression consists of at least one binary operator (+, *, -, /, ^) and the corresponding operands (each one being a single digit), and possibly a few properly matched pairs of parentheses. There are no white-spaces.   Output  		Output on a single line, the corresponding well-formed expression. There should be no white-spaces anywhere in the output expression.  		The default operator precedence is as follows: ^ has highest precedence. Then comes / and *, which have the same precedence. + and - have the same (least) precedence. Whenever there are two operators of the same precedence, the one that appears first in the expression (from left) will be evaluated first.   Constraints  		The expression given in the input will contain a maximum of 64 characters.   Example  Sample # 1 Input: 1+2  Output: (1+2)   Sample # 2 Input: 3-2-1  Output: ((3-2)-1)   Sample # 3 Input: 3-(2-1)  Output: (3-(2-1))   Sample # 4 Input: 1+2*(3-4)/5+1/2  Output: ((1+((2*(3-4))/5))+(1/2))   Sample # 5 Input: 1+2*(3-4)/5^1/2  Output: (1+(((2*(3-4))/(5^1))/2))

   Suppose a few students are giving an exam in the examination hall.The supervisor is bored of keeping a watch on the students so as they don't copy. However being a programmer, she has noticed few things.  The examination hall is a 2-D grid with M rows and N seats in each row. However students in say ,row 1 are the most mischievous and copy the most,But they don't copy from students of other rows as they are afraid of being caught. The N students seated in row 1 are numbered from 1 to N. Also a student in a single row of N seats can only copy from a student sitting either just ahead of him or just behind him .For 1st and last student in the row, they can only copy only from 2nd and 2nd to last student respectively.   Now the supervisor gets bored and starts thinking about how many ways can we select a non-empty subset of those N students in 1st row such that : For each of those selected subsets: (a)There are no two students who can copy from each other. (b)Addition of any of the remaining students in this subset results in copying. Note : Remaining students for a subset means students from 1 to N who are not present in this subset As answers can be large, print it modulo 1000000007(1e9+7).    Sample Explanation :  For N=5,there are 4 valid subsets = ({1,4},{2,4},{1,3,5},{2,5})   Subset {2,5} is valid subset because : 1) Student 2 and student 5 can't copy. So it satisfies property (a) 2) if we add student 1, then student 1 and student 2 will copy     if we add student 3, then student 2 and student 3 will copy     if we add student 4, then student 4 and student 5 will copy    Hence we cant add any of remaining students to this subset.So it satisfies property (b) Similarly {1,4} , {2,4} , {1,3,5} are valid subsets.   Subset {1,5} is not valid because :    if we add student 3 in this subset ,still no one can copy.Hence,it doesn't satisfy property (b). Subset {1,2,5} is not valid because :    Student 1 and student 2 can copy. Hence,it doesn't satisfy property (a). Similarly the remaining 25 subsets for N=5 are invalid.  Thus ,for N=5 , valid subsets(output) = 4     Input  First line will be number of test cases T. Each test case will have a single number N.   Output Number of subsets which satisfy both property (a) and (b) in a single line for each test case    Constraints 1<=T<=10^5 1<=N<=10^6  Example  4 1 2 5 30   Output: 1 2 4 4410   
`Note: Every where quotes are used just for clarity. Please always Ignore them except when mentioned explicitly.    There are N students and one teacher(name: Bhoondu) in a college. Each student is identified by his number K ( 1<=K<=N). Some of them are friends of each others. Friendship relation is equivalence relation, means:  A is friend of A. If A is friend of B then B is friend of A. If A is friend of B and B is friend of C then A is friend of C.  Some other information about the students is that:  If A is friend of B and A knows some thing(any information) then A will tell it to B. If A is NOT friend of B and A knows some thing(any information) then A will NOT tell it to B. If A knows some mistake of B and A is friend of B, A will NOT tell it to Bhoondu. If A knows some mistake of B and A is NOT friend of B , A will tell(complain) it to Bhoondu.  One student S out of these students(1,2,... N) has done a mistake. And one another student K somehow came to know about S's mistake. S DON'T know who is K. Now you have to help S to find out the maximum possible threat to him.  Threat is defined as how many students has complained about S to Bhoondu.  You are also given information about friendship of students in college. It will be given as pairs "A B" which means A is friend of B. Note that some information given to you may be redundant.   Input  First line will contain the number of test cases T. For each test case the first line will contain N S and F separated by space. Where N is the number of students, S is the student who made the mistake and F is the number of friendship information given to you. After this next F lines will contain two numbers A and B separated by space. There is no empty line between different test cases.   Output  For each test case the output will be an integer in a new line, which will be the maximum threat for S in the corresponding test case.   Input Constrain:  1 <= T <= 20 2 <= N <= 1000 0 <= F <= min(N*N,10000) 1 <= S,A,B <= N A != B  Example:  Input: 3 5 1 3 1 2 3 4 3 5 6 2 3 1 2 4 5 5 6 6 1 3 1 2 1 3 5 6  Output: 3 3 2  Explanation:  In 1st test case: If 2 will know about 1's mistake then he will not tell it to Bhoondu because he is his friend so 0 threat. If 3 will know about 1's mistake then he will tell it to 4,5. So three people will complain to Bhoondu, so threat = 3. Case for 4 and 5 is same as 3. So maximum threat = max(0,3,3,3) = 3.  
   There are N players named as 1,2,...,N. Each player has a skill value(call it S) which is a positive integer.  Higher the skill value better the player. All players are standing in a circle in the order 1,2,3...N. Each player have a dispute with some players standing next to him. Players standing next to 1 are {2,3,...,N} and players standing next to N are {1,2,3,...,N-1} You are given N the numbers of players, the skill value S of every player and D the player's dispute number. If the dispute number of a player is D then he has dispute with D players standing right next to him. You have to form a un-disputed(such that no player in the team has dispute with any other player in the team) team with maximum skill. The skill of a team is the sum of skill values of all the players in the team.   Input  First line will contain the number of test cases T. For each test case the first line will contain N, numbers of players. Second line of the test case will contain skill values(S) of all N players separated by space. Third line of the test case will contain the dispute numbers(D) of all N players separated by space. There is no empty line between different test cases.   Output  For each test case the output will be an integer in a new line, which will be the maximum skill of any non disputed team in the corresponding test case.   Input Constrain:  1 <= T <= 20 2 <= N <= 100 1 <= S <= 1000000 (skill value) 0 <= D <= N-1 (dispute number)  Example:  Input: 3 4 4 1 5 3 1 1 2 0 3 2 10 5 1 1 1 4 8 7 4 6 1 1 1 1  Output: 7 10 13  Explanation:  In 1st test case: 1 has dispute with {2}, 2 has dispute with {3}, 3 has dispute with {4,1} and 4 has dispute with none. So possible non disputed teams can be: {1,4} skill=7 {2,3} skill=4 {3}   skill=5 Teams {1}, {2}, {4} are also possible. So maximum skill of any un-disputed team = 7  
 Gandalf is fighting a Balrog in abandoned dwarf city of Moria. Unfortunately he doesn't have much time and want to end fight as soon as possible. As Gandalf is poor in maths you have to help him in forming the strategy. Balrog has power which is denoted by a number X. Gandalf has three types of weapon first one can reduce the power of Balrog to half, another weapon reduces Balrog's power to one third of the current power. The last weapon only reduces Balrog's power by decrementing it by one. To kill Balrog, Gandalf has to reduce his total power to zero by using minimum number of strike.   Input  The first line of input contains a integer T which denotes the number to test cases. After which T lines follows. Every line contains an integer X which denote the initial power of Balrog.   Output  For every test case output a integer in a new line which denotes the minimum number of strikes required to kill Balrog.   Input Constrain:  1 <= T <= 20 2 <= X <= 1000000  Example:  Input: 2 10 19  Output: 4 5  Explanation:  In 1st test case: First use weapon which reduce power by 1. Then use weapon which reduce power to one third twice. Then again the weapon which reduce power by 1. 10-1=9 9/3=3 3/3=1 1-1=0  
 You are given a flow graph G. The flow graph G has N vertices numbered from 1 to N. 1 is Source and N is Sink. There is no incoming edge into Source and no outgoing edge from Sink. There is either edge (u,v) or (v,u) in G. You are also given the capacity of each edges. Assume all capacities are positive integers. You calculated the maximum flow value in G. Now capacity of exactly one edge is increased by some positive integer value but not more than 1000. And you found that there was no change in maximum flow. Now your task is to find out that how many such edges are present in the graph G.   Input  First line will contain two integers N and E separated by space, where N is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. Next E lines will contain 3 integers u, v and c separated by space. Which means is that there is an edge from u to v having capacity c.   Output  You have to output an integer which is the number of edges(one at a time) for which increase in their capacity by not more than 1000 will not lead to increase in maximum flow.   Input Constrain:  2 <= N <= 50 1 <= E <= Maximum possible edges in graph u != v 1 <= c <= 100000   Example:  Input: 4 5 1 2 8 1 3 10 2 3 5 2 4 2 3 4 3  Output: 3  Explanation:  Increasing the capacity of edge (1,2),(1,3) and (2,3) (INDIVIDUALLY) does not have any effect on maximum flow.

Tom started his coding in python and he never used C language for coding. Today he started to learn C language but unlike python C language contains semicolon in the end of the statement.Tom is a beginner in C language so he doesn't know more keywords in c language.Tom uses only few keywords in his C code.Because of using Python Tom strictly follow indentation in his code. Now Tom wants to count no. of semicolon mistakes in his C code.  Rules where we use semicolon in C language code -  In general in the end of each line we use semicolon.  If line contains while, for, if, else and data type function-name(arguments) we will not use semicolon.We will use only int, void, float and char for data type.  We don't use semicolon after "{" and "}" symbol.  We will not use semicolon at the end of line if line contains "#" symbol in the starting of statement.  We will use "//" to indicates the end of program. Tom needs your help in making of this compiler.     Input Given a C language code.    Output Print the no. of semicolon mistakes in given C languge code.    Example Input: #include "stdio.h" int main() {   printf("hello world")   return 0; } //  Output: 1    Explanation Example case 1. In line 3 after printf statement a semicolon is missing so answer will be 1.

  Alan plans a heist to rob a bank. The bank has  N vaults containing money .Each vault is numbered from 1 to N. The ith vault of the bank contains rupees i. All the vaults are initially closed. But since the bank contains so much money, it has routine security checks in the following manner:    N security guards enter the bank.                                                                                                 The first security guard opens all the vaults.                                                                                    The second security guard closes every second vault.                                                                                       The third security guard opens every third vault.                                                                                In this manner, the ith security guard reverses the state(open or closed) of every ith vault in the bank. Alan enters the bank after all N security guards have finished their routine check. He can only rob all the open vaults. But before he commits the robbery, Alan decides to calculate the total amount of money he can rob. But since Alan is weak in mathematics, he asks you for help. Your task is to calculate the total amount of money Alan can rob from the bank.  (It is obvious that Alan can only steal money from all the OPEN vaults.)   Input The first line of input will contain an integer T which denotes the number of test cases. The next T lines will each have a positive whole number number N, denoting the number of vaults in the bank and also the Number of Guards that will be doing the routine check.   Output For each test case, Output a single line containing the total amount of money Alan can rob from the bank.  Constraints :  1 ≤ N ≤ 1000 (30 Points) 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^12(40 Points) (Easier Test Cases) 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^12(30 Points)     Example Input: 235  Output: 15    Explanation In the first case, there are 3 vaults. The vault which is open after 3 guards  do the routine check is only Vault Number 1. Hence Amount which can be stolen is 1. In the second case, There are 5 vaults. After 5 security guards enter, the open vaults are number 1 and number 4. Since the ith vault has i rupees, the amount which can be stolen is 1+4=5.  TIPS The input and output format is to be Strictly Followed.Each output will consist of a single line containing the required sum. Errors in inputting or outputting the numbers in the required format will make a correct solution give a Wrong Answer also! 
  Ramanujan loves to play with numbers. He once asked everyone in his class a question : “Given a Number N, what is the smallest number which can be formed whose product of DIGITS will be equal to N?  For example if N is 100 the number is 455.” His friend pointed out to him that there are certain numbers which cannot be formed in this manner. Ramanujan took due note of that and told everyone in his class to try solving this problem through programming. Your task is to Print the Smallest Number Whose Product of Digits is Equal to N. If there is no such number, you MUST print -1.     Input The First Line of Input will contain an Integer T, Denoting the Number of Test Cases.                                Each of the next T lines , each , will have a positive whole number N.  Output For each Test Case, Print on a new line the smallest number whose product of digits is N. If there is no such number print -1.  Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 10^3 (30 Points) 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^16 (70 Points)     Example Input: 3100139  Output: 455-119    Explanation In the first case, the smallest number whose product of digits is 100 is 455 as 4*5*5=100. For the second case there are no numbers in which the product of digits will give us the original number. So we print -1. For the third case 9 can be represented as 1*9 hence number is 19.  The Input and Output Format must be Strictly Followed. 
  As we all know, a substring is a contiguous subsequence of characters of a word. For example, the substrings of the word cat would be c,a,t,ca,at,cat. Given a String  S composed of only lower case characters, and a substring  X  also of lower case characters, your job is to remove all occurrences of X from S .    For example, if the String is “banana” and the substring is an, the resulting String would be “ba”.                                                                                                       If the resulting String has zero length, print “0” (without quotes).     Input The first Line of Input will contain an Integer T, Denoting the number of Test Cases. The next 2T  Lines will contain two Strings  S and X, alternatively.  Output For each test case, print the resulting String on a new line.  Constraints Should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have.

It is advised to use BufferedReader for this problem.  
  BILLIARDS is a really interesting game. It is played on a green baize with 3 balls-red, white and yellow. Sheldon and Leonard are playing a game of billiards. Sheldon is playing the game for the first time and is not familiar with the rules. So he asks Leonard to explain the rules to him. Leonard explains the rules to Sheldon in the following way:“A Cannon shot gives 2 points and an In-Off Shot gives 3 points.” Sheldon is curious, and wants to figure out that given a score X, in how many ways can he get that score by hitting a combination of Cannon and In-Off shots?Leonard is baffled when he is asked this question. Your task is to help Leonard in writing a program to compute the total number of ways one can score a total of X points by hitting any combination of Cannon and In-Off shots. The order in which the shots are hit have importance. For example, 5 can be scored in two ways, by hitting an In-Off Shot followed by a Cannon shot or a Cannon Shot followed by an In-Off shot. A score of 7 can be achieved in three ways – Cannon,In-Off,Cannon   Cannon,Cannon,In-Off    and    In-Off,Cannon,Cannon.     Input The first line of input will contain an integer T which denotes the number of test cases. 1<=T<=2000 The next  T  lines will each have a positive integer X, denoting the score which has to be achieved.   Output For each test case, Output a single line containing the  total number of ways one can score a score of X by hitting only Cannon and In-Off shots. Since the number can be very large, Output the answer MOD 1000000009(10^9+9)  Constraints  1 ≤ X ≤ 10^3 (30 Points) 1 ≤ X ≤ 10^6 (70 Points)     Example Input: 3572  Output: 231    Explanation Explanations of the first two cases are mentioned above. In the third case, a score of 2 can be achieved by hitting a cannon.  The Input and Output Format must be STRICTLY FOLLOWED 
 There is a Cartesian plane. Four points on it represent the houses of Elena Gilbert, Bonnie Bennett, Damon Salvatore and Caroline Forbes. Now, Elena is going to Damon’s home and Bonnie to Caroline’s. Both walk with same speed and they live in a wind free area. Now, you have to tell if they can meet in the way, anyhow..?? Note: They can meet only if their paths cross each other’s.   Input  First line will contain the number of test cases. First line of each test case will contain two numbers x and y, x being x coordinate and y being y coordinate of Bonnie’s place. Similarly second, third and fourth line will contain Caroline’s, Damon’s and Elena’s address respectively.  Output  For each test case there will be just one line of output, “yes” or “no”.   Example  Input: 1 0.0 0.0 4.4 4.0 1.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 Output: yes 
There are n children who have landed up in an unknown place where they find just some jar of cookies to eat. They also have a dog with them. The children gather all the cookies and put them in a big jar. Exhausted, they agree to go and wait until the next morning to divide up the cookies. At one o'clock in the morning, the first child wakes up. He realizes that he can't trust the others, and decides to take his share now. He divides the cookies into n equal shares, but there is one left over. He gives that cookie to the dog, hides his cookies, and puts the rest of the cookies back. At two o'clock, the second child wakes up. Not realizing that the first child has already taken his share, he too divides the cookies up into n shares, leaving one over which he gives to the dog. He then hides his share, and puts the remainder back. At three, four, five…… ‘n’ o'clock in the morning, the third, fourth, fifth …….nth children each wake up and carry out the same actions. In the morning, all the children wake up, and try to look innocent. No one makes a remark about the diminished share of cookies, and no one decides to be honest and admit that they've already taken their share. Instead, they divide the share up into nshares, for the (n+1)th time, and find that there is yet again one cookie left over, which they give to the dog. You have to find out how many cookies were present originally in the jar.  Input  The input will contain several numbers of test cases. The first line will contain the number of test cases(x) followed by ‘x’ lines of inputs which contains the values of ‘n’.  Output  For each input print the number of cookies present in the jar.   Example  Input: 2 5 6   Output: 15621 279931  
At the legendary times of Nonsenso wars in ISM Dhanbad, there was a neck to neck competition between Barney Stinson and Sheldon Cooper. They both were on level 19. After trying too hard both of them could not decipher the nonsense, so they decided to play alongside. Sheldon Cooper had to pass a message to Barney Stinson. So he decided to convert each letter of the sentence to their corresponding to their ASCII codes. When Barney received the message he could not get anything. Now you have to design a code which converts the encrypted message to readable format.   Input The input will consist of the first line containing the number of test cases ‘n’ followed by n lines of test cases.  Output  For each input print the decoded line.  Example  Input: 2 721011081081113287111114108100 871011089911110910132116111327311010010597   Output: Hello World Welcome to India  
 A large company wishes to monitor the cost of phone calls made by its personnel. To achieve this the PABX logs, for each call, the number called (a string of up to 15 digits) and the duration in minutes. Write a program to process this data and produce a report specifying each call and its cost, based on standard Telecom charges. International (IDD) numbers start with two zeroes (00) followed by a country code (1-3 digits) followed by a subscriber's number (4-10 digits). National (STD) calls start with one zero (0) followed by an area code (1-5 digits) followed by the subscriber's number (4-7 digits). The price of a call is determined by its destination and its duration. Local calls start with any digit other than 0 and are free.    Input  Input will be in two parts. The first part will be a table of IDD and STD codes, localities and prices as follows: Code * Locality name$price in cents per minute where * represents a space. Locality names are 25 characters or less. This section is terminated by a line containing 6 zeroes (000000). The second part contains the log and will consist of a series of lines, one for each call, containing the number dialled and the duration. The file will be terminated a line containing a single #. The numbers will not necessarily be tabulated, although there will be at least one space between them. Telephone numbers will not be ambiguous.   Output  Output will consist of the called number, the country or area called, the subscriber's number, the duration, the cost per minute and the total cost of the call, as shown below. Local calls are costed at zero. If the number has an invalid code, list the area as ``Unknown'' and the cost as -1.00.

 Brunno Doiuna is very fond of caper pizzas, which he always likes to share with his girlfriend. As she also loves capers, it is of the utmost importance, in order to avoid unnecessary quarrels, to split the pizza into two equally-sized slices in such a way that each half contains exactly the same number of capers. However, most caper pizzas also contain a number of peppercorns, and neither Brunno nor his girlfriend likes them. Therefore, it is also crucial that each of the two halves contain the same number of peppercorns. As you can easily observe, depending on the position of capers and peppercorns on the pizza, it is not always possible to make a straight-line cut into the pizza in such a way that the two slices have the same area and the same number of capers and peppercorns lie in each resulting piece. Your task is to design a program to decide if it is possible to make such a cut or not, knowing the positions of capers and peppercorns.   Input We will assume that the pizza is circular and is centered at the origin, and is big enough to contain all capers and peppercorns. We also assume that there is an even number of capers and an even number of peppercorns, and that no cut goes through any of the capers or pepper balls. Additionally, no pair of peppercorns, capers, or a peppercorn and a caper are aligned with the origin, or form an angle of less than 10-6 degrees with the origin. There can be multiple test cases, one after the other. The first line of a test case contains two even integers c>=0 and p>=0 (where 2<=c + p<=30000) separated by a space, the number of capers and peppercorns, respectively. Each of the following c lines describes the position of a caper using two floating point numbers, separated by a space, representing its x and y coordinates. Each of the next p lines holds two floating point numbers, the x and y coordinates of a peppercorn. A blank line follows each test case.  The last line of input will contain `-1 -1'. This marks the end of input -- do not write any output for this special last line.   Output  `YES' for a positive answer, `NO' otherwise.   Example  Input: 2 2 1 1 1 0 0 1 -1 1  2 2 1 1 -1 1 0 1 0.1 -1  -1 -1  Output: NO YES  
  Today, Mr. Joseph, our maths professor, taught us about the Fibonacci sequence and its applications in various places. He concluded the lesson by giving us a computational problem, which he stated as simple.  You are given two non-negative integers X and Y, you have to calculate the sum  (F(X) + F(X + 1) + ... + F(Y)) mod 1000000007, where F(N)=F(N-1)+F(N-2),N ≥ 2.     Input The first line contains an integer T (the number of test cases). Then, T lines follow. Each test case consists of a single line with two non-negative integers X and Y.    Output For each test case you have to output a single line containing the answer. Since the answer can be huge i.e go out of the bounds of integers, You are required to print the answer MOD 10^9+7    Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 1000 0 ≤ X ≤ Y ≤ 1000     Example Input: 3 2 6 3 5 10 19 170 725 Output: 19 10 10857 901453553  Explanation The fibonacci series goes like this 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21,.... For the first test case, we need to calculate the sum of the Fibonacci series from its 2nd term till 6th. ( i.e 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 ) = 19%(10^9+7) == 19 NOTE:  Use long int or long long int for data storage to avoid overflow.  HINT:  From the 100th term onward, the fibonacci numbers become too large to be stored in any integer in C or C++.  GIVEAWAY:  ( a + b + c + ...)%m = ( a%m + b%m +c%m + ....)%m    
  A quiz show rates participants according to their level intelligence. Two different quiz shows were organized, one for boys and the other for girls. Now the results of both quiz shows are out. The participants of both the shows have decided to date each other, but as usual they have difficulty in choosing their partners. The Maximum Match dating service (MMDS) comes to their rescue and matches them in such a way that that maximizes the intelligence bonds for all couples. If a boy has been rated at intelligence level x and a girl at intelligence level y, the value of their intelligence bond is x*y. Both shows contain N participants each. MMDS has done its job and your job is to find the sum of intelligence bonds for all the couples that MMDS has proposed.     Input The first line of the input contains an integer t, the number of test cases. t test cases follow.  Each test case consists of 3 lines:   The first line contains a single integer N (1 <= N <= 1000).   The second line contains N integers separated by single spaces denoting the intelligence levels of the boys.   The third line contains N integers separated by single spaces denoting the intelligence levels of the girls  . All intelligence ratings are on a scale of 0 to 10.   Output For each test case output a single line containing a single integer denoting the sum of the intelligence bonds for all pairs that MMDS has proposed.  Constraints  N ( 1 ≤ N<=1000)  All intelligence ratings are on a scale of 0 to 10.      Example Input: 2 2 1 1 3 2 3 2 3 2 1 3 2   Output: 5 15    
 Dhoni is fondly known as Mr. Cool but he is in a lot of trouble these days. The opposing batsmen are constantly scoring runs. Thus Dhoni is worried about when to take a powerplay such that runs scored by the opposite teams can be minimized. More precisely, he wants to take a powerplay in those stretch of the overs in which XOR  of the runs (in those overs) scored by the opposing team is minimum. Now Dhoni is able to guess the strategy of opposition teams and the amount of runs they intend to score in each over. He has found out that runs scored by the opposing team from over 'i' (Oi) to over 'j' (Oj) is the XOR  (not sum) of all runs between Oi and Oj (i, j inclusive). The match consists of N overs for each team and there is one single powerplay of Z overs. Note  :   The runs scored in a powerplay from over 'i' to over 'j' is NOT sum but XOR of the runs scored in the individual overs. And if there is more than one possibility of choosing a powerplay then prefer the later overs. Can you help the Mr. Cool in deciding when to take the powerplay?  Input  First line of the input will have T (number of test cases). Then for each test case first line will have two integers N and Z. The second line (of each test case) will have a list of N integers [O1, O2, ..., ON] which are the runs the opposing team intends to score in that respective over of the match.   Output  For each test case, output a single integer denoting from which over Dhoni should start the powerplay.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ Z ≤ N ≤ 10^4 0 ≤ Oi ≤ 10^12   Example Input 1 3 2 1 2 3  Output 2   Explanation  Runs in over 1 and 2 :  1 XOR 2 = 3 Runs in over 2 and 3 :  2 XOR 3 = 1 Since runs scored from over 1 to 2 is more than those in over 2 to 3, Dhoni should take powerplay from 2nd over itself. 
 This time Dhoni has developed a passion for strings. Dhoni has an integer N and infinite supply of the characters 'A','B' and 'C'. Dhoni wants to know how many beautiful strings of length N can be generated by using these characters. A string is considered as beautiful if it does not have "ABC" as its substring. But he does not know how to code so he is asking you to help him. Since this number may be quite large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.  Input  First line of input contains the number of test cases T.  Each of next T lines contain an integer N.    Output  For each test case, output the number of beautiful strings of length N.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤  10 1 ≤  N ≤  10^5   Example Input : 2 2 3  Output : 9 26   Explanation :  In the 1st test case, all 9 possible strings are beautiful as none of them have "ABC" as a substring. Hence the answer is 9.  In the 2nd test case, total 27 strings of length 3 are possible and only string “ABC” is not beautiful. Hence the answer is 26.  
 Virat is a guy who likes solving problems very much. Today Virat’s friend Jadega gave him a problem to solve. Jadeja gives Virat three numbers: N, L and R and Virat has to find out the count of numbers between L and R (both inclusive) which are divisible by at least 1 prime number belonging to range 1 to N (inclusive). Though Virat likes to solve problems, this one seems too hard for him to solve. So he turns to you in order to solve the problem. Now it is your job to solve this problem for Virat.  Input  First line of input contains number of test cases T. Each of next T lines contain 3 space separated integers:  N,L and R as described in the problem statement.   Output  For each test case, print a single line having the count of numbers between L and R (both inclusive) which are divisible by at least 1 prime number belonging to range 1 to N (inclusive).   Constraints  1 ≤ T   ≤ 10 2 ≤ N ≤ 50 1 ≤ L ≤  R ≤ 10^18   Example Input 2 6 1 15 10 17 29  Output 11 9   Explanation  In the 1st test case, primes in the range 1 to 6 are 2, 3 and 5. The numbers in the range 1 to 15 which are divisible by any of 2,3 or 5 are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15 (total 11).  In the 2nd test case, prime in the range 1 to 10 are 2, 3, 5 and 7. The number in the range 17 to 29 which are divisible by any of these primes are 18, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 (total 9).  
 There is going to be a Cricket match tonight for which N guests are invited. There are 9 rows, numbered from 1 to 9 in the stadium, each having several seats. Each row as well as each guest has some priority. Note:  Guest 1 is to be prioritized more than guest 2. Similarly guest 2 is to be more prioritized than guest 3 and so on. Row 1 is superior to row2. Similarly row 2 is superior to row 3 and so on.   Arrangement Criteria:   All the guests should get a seat of their choice. Each guest has a set of preferred rows in which they want a seat.    So now your work comes into play. :P You need to arrange them in different rows of their choice. No, its not that easy...you also need to prioritize. :) You need to find an arrangement in which guest 1 gets the seat in the best row possible out of his choice satisfying the arrangement criteria. Then you need to assign best seat to guest 2 and so on. So your task is to generate an arrangement prioritizing guests from 1 to N in a way such that it always complies with the arrangement criteria.  Input  First line consists of a number N. Next line will have 9 space separated integers, A1 to A9, denoting empty seats in each of the 9 rows respectively. This is followed by N lines, each of the form K followed by K space separated integers B1 to BK  denoting the seat preference of each guest from 1 to N.   Output  Print the N integers denoting the row number for each guest. If no arrangement is possible, print "It seems MSG" without quotes.   Constraints 1 ≤  N  ≤ 100 1  ≤ K  ≤ 9 0  ≤ Ai  ≤ 9 1  ≤ Bi   ≤ 9  Example Input 5 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 5 1 2 3 4 5 1 1 5 1 2 3 4 5 5 1 2 3 4 5 5 1 2 3 4 5  Output 2 1 3 4 5   Explanation  Guest 1 should be allotted row 1 but as guest 2 has only row 1 as preference so we will not be able to arrange them. So guest 2 will be allotted row 1. Then Guest 1 will be allotted Row 2 followed by row 3 to guest 3, row 4 to guest 4 and row 5 to guest 5 as guest 3 has high priority than Guest 4 and Guest 5.  
  Nitesh recently discovered a new game CODATHON with the help of a very intelligent alien friend Jupiter. In this game a student had various challenges and each challenge had infinite number of problems. The scoring system in this game was quite different. There are 2 ways of scoring on a given problem:  If you are in the first 200 to submit solution you get +a points,  In all other cases you get +b points,  Note : a,b are different for every challenge.   Now for a particular challenge with scores a and b, Nitesh wants to find out the largest score that is not possible to achieve. Also Nitesh decided not to make a>b always ( after all Jupiter suggested it & nobody knows why !!! :P ).    Input First Line of Input Contains T, Number of testcases, Each testcase has 2 numbers a and b.    Output For each testcase output the largest score which is not possible to achieve in a new line. If all scores are achievable print 'infinite solutions' without quotes. NOTE : The output in some cases can be extremely large, therefore print it modulo 10^9+7.    Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10^9 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^18 1 ≤ b ≤ 10^18     Example Input: 2 3 4 5 7  Output: 5 23    Explanation Example case 1: With a=3 and b=4, except 5 all scores are possible: eg. 6 = 3 + 3        7 = 3 + 4        8 = 4 + 4 and so on.

 Many years ago there was a kingdom called 'sentence', which comprises of two groups namely strings and integers. Strings consists of all the characters and alphabets(both capital and small) whereas the integers consists of all the kinds of numbers. 'A' was the leader of strings and was prefer over '0' the leader of integers by the people of the kingdom. King of the sentences was very old, so he kept a competition for deciding the next king. In the competition only 'A' and '0' participated. '0' knew that he was going to lose in the competition so he attacked on the strings. String 'X' came running to 'A' and told him that '0' is going to kill all the strings. 'A ' is terrified and wants to protect his group. He knows that if he wants to stop '0' he needs to remove all the integers from kingdom. So he asks your help in killing all the integers. Help 'A' in removing all the integers from the kingdom and hence protect all the strings.  Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.  Next T lines contain a sentence 'S' formed from integers and strings. The length of S is denoted by L. (it is guaranteed that after killing all the integers, L>0).   Output  Print the sentence consisting of only strings in the given order.    Constraints  2 < T < 1000 2 < L < 10000   Example Input: 2 CodeVaitam 2015@Nit agartala. Codechef  Output: CodeVaitam @Nit agartala. Codechef

 There were four friends who used to live together in 19th century in South California. Each of them knew to solve only one kind of mathematical operator. One day, walking by a temple, they found a metal piece with N numbers engraved on it. When they showed it to the priest, he suggested that it might be an indication of the coordinates of a treasure. He also suggested that it can be cracked by performing the basic mathematical operators (/, *, +, -) in such a fashion that the operators be inserted between the numbers in the order given above and after the operators are inserted in one iteration, in the next iteration the start of the next insertion starts from the next operator from which it was inserted in previous iteration.

  Everyone knows the famous detective Sherlock. He has been handed over a new case of "The Abominable Bride". Each night she kills N people but to irritate Sherlock she leaves exactly one people. The way she kills the people is somewhat strange. She makes 1 to N people stand in a line and starts killing them. But, in the line when she kills the first person, there's time for the person standing next in line to run away at the end of the line.Again she kills the first person and the second one next to him runs to the last of the line. In this way after killing, there is exactly one person standing in the line who is saved and he runs to Sherlock to explain the situation each night. Help Sherlock find out the person that will be saved at the end of the massacre.  Constraints and Example Input: 5 2 4 6 9 12  Output: 2 4 4 2 8   Explanation  For the 2nd test case, she kills 1 and 2 goes at the end of line i.e., 3 4 2. Then she kills 3rd and 4th goes at the end of line i.e. 2 4. Then she kills 2 and ultimately 4th is the lone survivour.

Lucky bank is very famous for it's schemes. Each year the Manager of the Lucky bank comes up with a new scheme. There are N customers each having a locker in the Lucky bank, i th customer has a locker with locker number i. Initially there was no money in their lockers. It has been one year since Lucky bank is established. Yes, today is it's anniversary. So, The Manager of the bank wants to make the customers happy.  He comes up with a new scheme. The scheme is as follows:If the i th customer (having locker number: i ) deposits  M $ in his locker, Then all the lockers numbered 2*i ,3*i ,4*i........j*i where j*i <=N    will also be deposited with M $. No wonder, who won't be happy with such a scheme? There are two types of queries TYPE1 Query:- 	UPDATE K M 	This means that customer with locker number K deposits M $ in his account. TYPE2 Query:- 	ASK  K 	Customer K wants to know the money present in his locker (Customer K has locker number K).  INPUT:- First line of the input contains a single integer N , No. of customers.Second line of the input contains a single integer Q, Number of queries.Then Q lines follow, each with a query of a TYPE1 or TYPE2  OUTPUT:- Output the money in the locker of the customer in a new line if the query is of TYPE2  Constraints:- 1<=k<=n<=100000 1<=q<=10000 1<=m<=100000  Sample Input : 10 5 UPDATE 1 10 UPDATE 3 3 UPDATE 2 10 ASK 6 ASK 10  Sample Output : 23 20  Explanation:- When customer with locker number 1 deposits 10$ in his locker, Then all the customers with locker numbers 2*1,3*1......will also get 10$.Similarly when, customer 3 deposits 3$ in his account, then all the customers with locker numbers 6,9 will also get 3$.Similarly with UPDATE 2 10.Hence ASK 6 gives 23 as the output.

In a country, a person's health and wealth is measured in terms of time(seconds) left. Suppose a person there has 24x60x60 = 86400 seconds left, then he would live for another 1 day. A person dies when his time left becomes 0. Some time-amount can be borrowed from other person, or time banks. Some time amount can also be lend to another person, or can be used to buy stuffs. The president of that country is in very critical condition and has very less time left. A bank is giving away free time amount worth 1000 years. Bank released N slips, A[1],A[2],...A[N]. Each slip has a time amount(can be +ve or -ve). A person can pick any number of slips(even none, or all of them, or some of them) out of the N slips. But bank introduced a restriction, they announced one more number K. Restriction is that, if a person picks a slip A[i], then the next slip that he can choose to pick will be A[i+K+1]. It means there should be a difference of atleast K between the indices of slips picked. Now slip(s) should be picked in such a way that their sum results in maximum positive time-amount sum possible with the given restriction. If you predict the maximum positive sum possible, then you win.   Input Format   First line of the test file contains single number T, the number of test cases to follow. Each test case consists of two lines. First line contains two numbers N and K , separated by a space. Second line contains the N numbers A[1], A[2] ..... A[N] separated by space.

Raju loves to play logical games,One fine day his friend Gopi came to his home and told him about a game known as game of dots which his professor asked him in his maths class.As Gopi knew that raju is very passionate about solving logical problems so he decided to play the game with him.Gopi started telling the rules of the game to raju which goes like this- The game is played on a square field consisting of n × n cells. Initially all cells are empty. On each turn a player chooses and put a dot in an empty cell that has no common sides with previously dotted cells. Adjacent corner of dotted cells is allowed. On the next turn another player does the same, then the first one and so on. The player with no cells to put a dot on his turn loses the game. Gopi have chosen the field size n and allowed Raju to choose to be the first or the second player in the game. What should you choose for Raju to let him win the game? Both players play optimally.   Input The only line of the input contains one integer n  — the size of the field.  Output  Output number 1, if Raju making the first turn wins when both Raju and Gopi play optimally, otherwise print number 2.

ALICE and BOB are playing a game with strings. Both of them have a string of length N consisting of lower case characters only.   A permutation of “abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz” is given in the input that defines the POWER of the characters (a-z). The position of the character starting from the left defines the POWER of a character. The position of the leftmost character is taken to be 0. If a character is common to both the strings, it is destroyed. The powers of the leftout characters of each of the strings are added separately.  If a character is repeated, then power of only one such character is added. Person with the string of HIGHER POWER wins.   ALICE and BOB want to check if you are smart enough to declare the winner in advance!! Are you ready? ;)   Input The first line of the input contains an integer T, denoting the length of the conversation, and the string M, denoting a permutation of the string "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" which defines the power of characters. T and M are separated by exactly one space. The description of T test cases follows.

   The Chef is fond of polynomials so he decides to fix the rate of the food items in the form of a polynomial equation for his hotel. He decides to put the rate of the items in the form of coefficients of the polynomial where, if the  rate of tea is "a1" and rate of sandwich is "a2”  and so on, then the rate list will be in the form of a0 *x^0+ a1 *x^1.......aN-1 *x^(N-1). But his competitor Ciel copies this policy .In the same way, Ciel also designs a polynomial rate list for his hotel. But this makes the condition miserable for both of them as the profit gets divided in an unbalanced form. So both of them decide to multiply the coefficient of their polynomial and get a resultant polynomial. They put the resultant list on their rate boards. But they are weak in mathematics so help them to do this task!!     Input First line of the Input contains T, the number of test cases.  Each test case is given as follows: Two space separated integers ,  N1 and N2 which denote the degree of polynomials of Chef and Ciel respectively.

Bob has recently learnt how to play basketball and he was told by Alice that the rules in basketball were as follows : • 1 point for a free throw • 2 points for a throw from within the D • 3 points for a throw from outside the D Being an inquisitive mind that Bob is, he would like to know how many combinations of 1-pointers, 2-pointers and 3-pointers can lead to a team score of N points. Now if a team has scored enough points, Bob wouldn't be able to remember the number of possible combinations long enough to show-off in front of your friends. So you decide to keep track of result modulo 100001. Help Bob to compute the number of combinations of 1-pointers, 2-pointers and 3-pointers that can lead to a team score of N points.   Input The first line contains single integer T - the number of test cases. T test cases follow.For each test case input will just be a number which denotes the team score N.  Output Output should be number of combinations of 1-pointers, 2-pointers and 3-pointers that can lead to the given team score modulo 100001.  Constraints 1 ≤ T ≤ 100 0 ≤ N < 10^8  Sum of all the N's across a test file doesn't exceed 10^8.   Example Input: 4 8 12 1033 894755  Output: 10 19 89441 22727    Explanation Example case 1:For the 1st test case,following are the possible combinations for team score of 8 1x8 1x6 + 2x1 1x4 + 2x2 1x2 + 2x3 2x4 1x5 + 3x1 1x3 + 2x1 + 3x1 1x1 + 2x2 + 3x1 1x2 + 3x2 2x1 + 3x2  NOTE : Use fast Input Output. 
Its the 22nd century and the terror of Codezilla is at its height. Codezilla is the most evil and dangerous hacker that ever existed. He has broken all systems of governance and the world has descended into anarchy. Eon, a young hacker, is fed up with the situation and has decided to put an end to Codezilla.   Eon meets a mysterious man called Cypher who is on the same mission. He tells Eon that to fight against Codezilla first he needs to get out of the real world and enter the Matrix. For this he needs to take some pills.  Cypher gives a set of pills to Eon. There are three types of pills: Blue,Red and Green. Eon can select any number of consecutive pills but he must take atleast one red pill, one blue pill and one green pill to enter the matrix. As eating more pills can be harmful, help Eon select the minimum number of pills.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each of the next T lines contains a string depicting the set of pills. Each character of the string is 'B', 'R' or 'G' standing for blue, red and green pills respectively.  Output For every test case, print in a single line the minimum number of consecutive pills that Eon should take so that he gets atleast one pill of each colour.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 3 ≤ Length of string ≤ 100000 The input string will contain atleast one each of 'B', 'R' and 'G'.     Example Input: 2 BBRG RGGGBBR  Output: 3 4  Explanation Example case 1. Eon selects the pills from 2 to 4, so he takes 3 pills. Example case 2. Eon can select 5 pills from 1 to 5 or he can select 4 pills from 4 to 7. So the answer is 4. 
Eon is still on his quest to defeat Codezilla but he is stuck. He has reached a secret vault which according to Cypher, contains valuable information about Codezilla's information systems. But the vault is password locked. Till now Eon has been able to decipher the following things about the password:  Maximum possible length of the password The string S such that each character of the password is smaller than or equal to the corresponding character of S. password[i]<=S[i] ( 0 <= i < |S| ). Also the password will be lexicographically smaller than S. The password consists of only small English alphabets 'a' to 'z'.   Now Eon makes a brute force program to enter all possible passwords. Tell him the maximum number of attempts he would have to make to get the correct password.   NOTE : The string A = A1...AN is called lexicographically smaller than the string B = B1...BN if there exists K from 1 to N, inclusive, such that Ai = Bi for i = 1, ..., K-1, and AK < BK. We compare small letters by their positions in the English alphabet. So 'a' is the smallest letter, 'b' is the second smallest letter, ..., 'z' is the largest letter.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains the maximum possible length of the password L and the second line contains the string S.  Output For every test case, print in a single line the answer for the corresponding input. Since the answer can be very large, print the answer modulo 1000000007.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ |S| ≤ 10000 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9   Example Input: 2 2 b 3 abc  Output: 27 8  Explanation Example case 1. Eon will need to enter "a","aa","ab","ac","ad",..."az". So answer is 27. Example case 2. Eon will need to enter "a","aa","aaa","aab","aac","ab","aba","abb". So the answer is 8. 
In the secret vault, Eon gets information about the existence of Codezilla's castle and he finds a map with its location. But on his way to the castle, Eon encounters a maze. Now this is no ordinary maze. The maze is in the form of a rectangle with n rows and m columns. Each cell of the maze is a room and a room in the ith row and jth column is addressed as room(i,j). Rows are numbered from 1 to n from bottom to top and columns are numbered from 1 to m from left to right. The maze has two types of rooms: type A and type B. In each room of type A, there is a monster who is very hungry and Eon must give him a candy otherwise the monster will eat him. The room also contains one gold coin. In each room of type B, there is a guard who is very greedy and Eon must give him a gold coin otherwise the guard will kill him. The room also contains a candy. Every room has a door to every adjacent room (Rooms that share an edge are adjacent rooms). Before entering the maze Eon has the choice of taking either a gold coin or a candy. Eon enters the maze from room(1,1) and he has to reach the room(n,m) to get out of the maze. Eon does not have much time. Tell Eon the minimum number of rooms he needs to visit to get out of the maze alive.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. First line of each test case consists of two integers n and m.Then follows n lines with m characters each describing the maze. '0' for room of type A and '1' for room of type B.  Output For every test case print the minimum number of rooms Eon needs to visit to get out of the maze. If it is not possible to cross the maze, print "-1" without the quotes.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000     Example Input: 2 3 3 011 001 000 2 2 11 00  Output: 5 -1 
After crossing the maze, Eon has finally reached Codezilla's castle. But entering the castle is not going to be so easy. In his early days, Codezilla used to be an ace competitive programmer. He knew such a day would come when someone like Eon will rise against him. So instead of a password, Codezilla has set a programming problem to enter the castle. The puzzle is as follows: You are given three integers N,X and M. Then there are M queries each containing two integers L and R. For each query you have to print the count of numbers Y such that L<=Y<=R and GCD(N,Y)=X. Eon has always been more into development rather than competitive programming. So help him solve the puzzle.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. First line of each test case consists of three integers N, X and M. Each of the next M lines contains two integers L and R.  Output Print the answer of each query in a separate line.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^9 1 ≤ X ≤ N ≤ 10^9 1 ≤ M ≤ 1000 1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ 10^9   Example Input: 1 10 2 2 1 10 5 5  Output: 4 0  Explanation Example case 1. From 1 to 10, there are 4 numbers 2, 4, 6 and 8 such that their GCD with 10 is 2. 
Now its time for the final battle between Eon and Codezilla. There are N weapons available numbered from 1 to N. The cost of weapon i is C[i] (1<=i<=N). There will be M attacks. In each attack Eon will choose K weapons from the range of weapons numbered between L and R (both inclusive). All weapons have the same damage power. Eon wants to spend the minimum amount possible for each attack .Tell Eon the amount that he will need to spend for each attack.  Input First line of the input contains an integer N. The next line contains N space separated integers representing the array C representing the cost of the weapons. Next line contains an integer M. Each of the next M lines contains three integers L, R and K.  Output Output should consists of M lines. The i'th line should contain the minimum amount that Eon needs to spend for the i'th attack. Since the answer can be large, output the answer modulo 10^9+7.  Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 20000 1 ≤ M ≤ 20000 1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ N 1 ≤ K ≤ R-L+1 1 ≤ C[i] ≤ 10^9   Example Input: 5 9 3 5 3 1 2 1 3 2 2 5 3  Output: 8 7  Explanation Example case 1. Eon will choose the weapons 2 and 3. So the answer is 3+5=8. Example case 2.  Eon will choose the weapons 2, 4 and 5. So the answer is 1+3+3=7 
  Ki and Ka like to play the game tower of Hanoi. One day Ki challenges Ka to build the tallest tower from a set of disks of different height and radius. The tower of Hanoi can be built by stacking disks on top of each other. In order to put disk A on top of disk B, the radius and height of A must be strictly smaller than those of B. Help Ka to win the challenge.    Input First line of input contains number of test cases T. First line of each test case contains value of N, the number of disks.

Working from left-to-right if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its left it is called an increasing number; for example, 22344. Similarly if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its right it is called a decreasing number; for example, 774410 we shall call a positive integer that is neither increasing nor decreasing a “bouncy” number; for example, 155349.WAP to check whether a number is bouncy or not.  Input The input consists of one number given as input at a time,the program checks if the number is bouncy or not.The number of test cases have to be specified in the first input.  Output The output displays whether the number is bouncy or not,i.e it displays 1 when the number is bouncy and 0 when its not. Input: 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 150  Output: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 
It can be seen that the number, 125874, and its double, 251748, contain exactly the same digits, but in a different order. WAP to check that if 2 such numbers have this property  Input: The first line will consist of the total number of test cases T(1 ≤ T ≤ 10). The next T lines will consist of one number on each line.

A Discrete Mathematics professor has a class of NN students. Frustrated with their lack of discipline, he decides to cancel class if fewer than KK students are present when class starts. Given the arrival time of each student, determine if the class is canceled. Input Format The first line of input contains TT, the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line has two space-separated integers, NN (students in the class) and KK (the cancelation threshold). The second line contains NN space-separated integers (a1,a2,…,aNa1,a2,…,aN) describing the arrival times for each student. Note: Non-positive arrival times (ai?0ai?0) indicate the student arrived early or on time; positive arrival times (ai>0ai>0) indicate the student arrived aiai minutes late. Output Format For each test case, print the word YES if the class is canceled or NO if it is not. Constraints 1?T?101?T?10 1?N?10001?N?1000 1?K?N1?K?N ?100?ai?100,where i?[1,N]?100?ai?100,where i?[1,N] Note If a student arrives exactly on time (ai=0)(ai=0), the student is considered to have entered before the class started. Sample Input 2 4 3 -1 -3 4 2 4 2 0 -1 2 1 Sample Output YES NO Explanation For the first test case, K=3K=3. The professor wants at least 33 students in attendance, but only 22 have arrived on time (?3?3 and ?1?1). Thus, the class is canceled. For the second test case, K=2K=2. The professor wants at least 22 students in attendance, and there are 22 who have arrived on time (00 and ?1?1). Thus, the class is not canceled 
Jasmine is a very lazy girl. She always sleeps in Maths class. One day her teacher catches her sleeping and tells her that he would mark her absent for the whole semester. While he pretends to be strict, he is actually very kind-hearted. So he wants to give Jasmine a chance to prove herself. He gives her a problem. If Jasmine can answer it correctly, he will forgive her. Can you help Jasmine find the answer to this problem? The problem: The teacher gives Jasmine a number N and asks her to find out the probability that any proper divisor of N would be an even perfect square. Note: Even perfect square means the number should be even and a perfect square. Input Format The first line of input contains an integer T, the number of test cases. T lines follow, each line containing N, the number that the teacher provides. Output Format For each test case, print in a newline the output in p/q format where p and q are positive coprime integers. If p is 0, you should simply output 0. Constraints 1<=T<=4×10^4 2<=N<=10^6 Sample Input  4 2 8 36 900 Sample Output  0 1/3 1/8 3/26 
A forward shifted alphabet code is a form of coding in which each letter has been shifted for a particular number. For example, if a message has been encrypted by shifting 2, then 'C' will be written in place of 'A' , 'B' in place of 'Z', 'A' in place of 'Y' and so on. Such integers are the keys to decode shifted alphabet codes. Thaton likes sending encoded messages(only alphabets) to Pravakar. So to decode those messages she gave him N alarm clocks, all set at 12 O' clock with batteries removed, placed sequentially in a box. The alarm clocks rings every  { x1,x2,x3,x4,..........,xn }  hours respectively. While sending the message, she tells Pravakar not to consider a continuous sequence of alarm clocks in the set from positions L to R i.e from XL to XR is not under consideration and ask him to insert the batteries in the rest of the alarm clocks (except alarm clocks from L to R) and informs him that the minimum number of hours after which all the clocks under consideration ring simultaneously is the key to her message. Help Pravakar!! Note :  Shifting of character occurs in a circular manner, i.e. if 'y' need to be shifted forward by 2, 	Then y+2='a' i.e in forward shifting, after z we starts with 'a' again, and in backward shifting , after 'a' we again starts with 'z' e.g back shift 'c' by 5 will be : 'x'.   Input   1st Line contains a single integer N denoting numbers of alarm clocks. 2nd line contains N space separated integers { x1,x2,x3,x4,..........,xn } as described in the statement. 3rd line contains a single integer Q denoting the number of Queries. 1st line for each query contains two space separated integers L and R. 2nd line for each query contains the encoded message.   Output For each Query, print the decoded message in a line.  Constraints  1 <=N,Xi,L,R <=20 1 <=Q <=200 1 <= Length of Encoded Message<=256   Sample Input: 3 1 2 3 1 3 3 YgneqogvqVgejnqp Output: WelcometoTechlon  Explanation One of the clock rings every hour while the other rings every 2 hours and since the value of L =3 and R=3, So third clock is not under consideration. So, the 1st and 2nd clock will ring together after two hours. In other words, all the letters in the given string has been shifted forward by 2. So to decode the message, we have to shift each character backward by 2 
 The Wonderking in Wonderland had a great friend called Wondermath a professor in mathematics. The king and the professor shared everything, they were same age, married same day, have same number of children etc. To represent this friendship  professor Wondermath introduced Amicable numbers, a pair who is friends like him and king.  Amicable numbers are a pair of numbers with the following property: the sum of all of the proper divisors of the first number (not including itself) exactly equals the second number while the sum of all of the proper divisors of the second number (not including itself) likewise equals the first number. The set of 220 and 284 was the first known set of amicable numbers. Pythagoras discovered the relationship and coined the term amicable because he considered the numbers to be a symbol of friendship. For example:  For example let's show that  220 & 284 are amicable numbers: First we find the proper divisors of 220:  1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, 110  If you add up all of these numbers you will see that they sum to 284.   Now find the proper divisors of 284:   1, 2, 4, 71, 142  These sum to 220, and therefore 220 & 284 are amicable numbers. To satisfy his friend Wonderking, professor wants to find many Amicable numbers before the tea time tomorrow. You must develop a program that declares a number is amicable or not in order to help professor WonderMath.    Input The first line of the input file contains the number cases (<10) followed by set of numbers ( < 100,000,000) one in each new line which you have to declare amicable or not.  Output If the number is not an amicable number it should print no, if it is an amicable number it should print yes and the amicable number of it.  Example Input: 4 1184 2620 3550 5020   Output: Yes, amicable with 1210 Yes, amicable with 2924 No Yes, amicable with 5564   Explanation Explained in the above section. 
  Wonderland is a big land. WonderKing wanted to divide it in to provinces and rule them because that is easy. But he has a problem with naming the provinces. He wants to name them with mirrored palindromes only.  A regular palindrome is a string of numbers or letters that is the same forward as backward. For example, the string "ABCDEDCBA" is a palindrome because it is the same when the string is read from left to right as when the string is read from right to left.  A mirrored string is a string for which when each of the elements of the string is changed to its reverse (if it has a reverse) and the string is read backwards the result is the same as the original string. For example, the string "3AIAE" is a mirrored string because "A" and "I" are their own reverses, and "3" and "E" are each others' reverses.  A mirrored palindrome is a string that meets the criteria of a regular palindrome and the criteria of a mirrored string. The string "ATOYOTA" is a mirrored palindrome because if the string is read backwards, the string is the same as the original and because if each of the characters is replaced by its reverse and the result is read backwards, the result is the same as the original string. Of course, "A", "T", "O", and "Y" are all their own reverses.  A list of all valid characters and their reverses is as follows.    .Character.  Reverse.  Character.  Reverse. Character.  Reverse.   A A M M Y Y   B  N  Z 5   C  O O 1 1   D  P  2 S   E 3 Q  3 E   F  R  4    G  S 2 5 Z   H H T T 6    I I U U 7    J L V V 8 8   K  W W 9    L J X X      The WonderKing wants you to help him to find palindromes, mirrored strings, mirrored palindromes separately.  Input  First line of input contains the number of strings you should check Each following line contains a string which you should check with your program. Each line will consist of one to fifty valid characters.  There will be no invalid characters in any of the strings.   Output  For each input string, you should print that string and immediately follow it by exactly one of the following strings.   String Criteria   "is not a palindrome." if the string is not a palindrome and is not a mirrored string   "is a regular palindrome." if the string is a palindrome and is not a mirrored string   "is a mirrored string." if the string is not a palindrome and is a mirrored string   "is a mirrored palindrome." if the string is a palindrome and is a mirrored string    Example Input: 4 NOTAPALINDROME ISAPALINILAPASI 2A3MEAS ATOYOTA  Output: NOTAPALINDROME is not a palindrome. ISAPALINILAPASI is a regular palindrome. 2A3MEAS is a mirrored string. ATOYOTA is a mirrored palindrome.  
 WonderKing himself is a very genius in mathematics. One day when he was thinking, king got a wonderful idea – circular prime. A circular prime is a prime number with the property that the number generated at each intermediate step when cyclically permuting its (base 10) digits will be a prime. Simply if all the rotational digits of a number are themselves primes, it is called a circular prime number. Let's see an example where numbers are generated by cyclically permuting the digits of 19937. The first digit is removed and readded at the right side of the remaining string of digits. This process is repeated until the starting number is reached again. Since all intermediate numbers generated by this process are prime, 19937 is a circular prime. 19937 is the first circular prime WonderKing encountered. 199379937193719371997199319937 Later he was managed get the first 10 circular primes, they will be 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 37, 79, 113. You have to help him to find more circular primes.  Input Input description. Tips:  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases, i.e. number of cases you are required to check. T is followed by the numbers you need to check whether they are circular primes or not   Output If a certain number is a circular prime print yes. If not a circular prime print no.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 Each and every test case would be less than 1,000,000   Example Input: 5 3 113 67 9311 19  Output: Yes Yes No Yes No  
While having the dinner WonderKing and professor WonderMath was discussing about Ideal numbers – a great topic in mathematics, WonderQueen who was not that much interested in mathematics , was listening to the discussions and was thinking only a number can be ideal, why not strings?. She asked it from her mother who is a expert in language, she replied Yes and gave an explanation to Ideal String.  Amicable numbers are a pair of numbers with the following property: the sum of all of the proper divisors of the first number (not including itself) exactly equals the second number while the sum of all of the proper divisors of the second number (not including itself) likewise equals the first number. An Ideal string is a string where the index of the first occurrence of each letter is equal to the number of occurrences of that letter in the string. (Assume index starts with 1). For example:  For example the string CIOOIO is an ideal string.  1.The letter C appears only one time and index of the first occurrence of it is 1. : 2.The letter I appear two times and index of the first occurrence of it is 2. : 3.The letter O appears three times and index of the first occurrence of it is 3. :  BEECCCC is also an ideal string.  1.The letter B appears only one time and index of the first occurrence of it is 1. : 2.The letter E appear two times and index of the first occurrence of it is 2. : 3.The letter C appears four times and index of the first occurrence of it is 4. :  WonderQueen got so much interested about Ideal Strings, she wanted to explore more and more Ideal strings, So you must help her..   Input The first line of the input file contains the number cases (<10) followed by set of numbers ( < 100,000,000) one in each new line which you have to declare amicable or not. The first line of the input file contains the number of strings ( < 100) followed by strings in each new line ( length of a string < 20) with only letters od uppercase in English alphabet, that you have to check ideal or not.   Output  If a string is ideal you must print, Yes Else, No   Example Input:  5 BEECCCC CIOOIO FEDEED DIFFFI BUHUHH   Output: Yes Yes No Yes Yes    Explanation Explained in the above section. 
A war between Wonderland and Lierland started. So our leader WonderKing had to go to the war base, but he is going to miss his love WonderQueen. So WonderKing decided to send messages often to WonderQueen,  but did not want any other to read them and understand the  messages, so he used a strange language Pig Latin.  It is not related to pigs or Latin. But it was a safe language. The usual rules for changing standard English into Pig Latin are as follows:  In words that begin with consonant sounds, the initial letter is moved to the end of the word, and "ay" is added, as in the following examples:  happy --> appyhay question --> uestionqay  In words that begin with vowel (a , e , I , o , u) letter the syllable "way" is simply added to the end of the word. another --> anotherway about --> aboutway  As he wants to send messages recently to WonderQueen king wants you to provide a program for him.Your program to this problem is simply a English to Pig Latin converter adhering to above rules.  Input The first line of the input file contains the number of cases ( < 10) and followed by English. In the sentences first letter will be capital ( A – Z) and the rest of the characters are letters ( a – z) and spaces followed by a full stop.   Output  The appropriate Pig Latin translated sentences, the sentence should begin with a capital letter and end with the full stop.   Example Input: 6 I love you. We won the war. Tea is ready. He came here. There is a huge traffic. I was there.    Output: Iway ovelay ouyay. Eway onway ethay arway. Eatay isway eadyray. Ehay amecay erehay. Heretay isway away ugehay raffictay. Iway asway heretay.     Explanation Explained in the above section. 
This time it was WonderKing’s opportunity to challenge WonderMath, although it is hard to give him a challenge, king gave a challenge. It is like follows. King gives a number that is sum of most 10 consecutive numbers and least 2 consecutive numbers. WonderMath has to find those consecutive numbers which has to add. As an Example : We can write 18 as the sum of consecutive as follow, 18 = 5 + 6 + 7 18 = 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 In this challenge you have to consider most consecutive numbers, so the answer will be 3,4,5,6. Your program must help WonderMath to find those consecutives.  Input The first line contains the number of cases (< 100), and then in each new line the number ( < 10,000)you have to find consecutives.   Output  The consecutive numbers that sums up to produce the number given in the input file, each number separated by a space.   Example Sample Input: 4 12 18 40 171   Sample Output: 3 4 5 3 4 5 6 6 7 8 9 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18    Explanation Explained in the above section. 
 You receive a credit C at a local store and would like to buy two items. You first walk through the store and create a list L of all available items. From this list you would like to buy two items that add up to the entire value of the credit.

Aliens are planning to attack on Earth. Scientists at ISRO got a breakthrough when they were able to intercept the message being transferred in between aliens, but the problem is that aliens are using a technique for encrypting the message. Codefest team of IT-BHU were able to hack into the systems of aliens and decipher the method, the aliens were using for encryption but a method for decryption has not been found yet. You are required to decrypt the message. The method used for encryption is explained below: Consider a string of N alphabets for example encrypt (N=7). The string is treated as if the last character wraps around back to the first. Next consider a set S of N different strings, in which each string is formed by cyclic rotation of the alphabets of the original string. So for the string encrypt, S = {encrypt, ncrypte, crypten, ryptenc, yptencr, ptencry, tencryp} The next step is to perform a lexicographical sort in decreasing order on the set of above strings. So S becomes {yptencr, tencryp, ryptenc, ptencry, ncrypte, encrypt, crypten} Now, the encyrpted string of N alphabets is formed taking the last character from the above sorted strings. For given example, the encrypted string is rpcyetn. They also send the position of the first character of the encrypted string so that the message can be decrypted i.e. 5 for the given example.  Input There is a single integer T<=200 on the first line of input which denotes the number of test cases to follow. Each of the next T lines, contains a string made up of k alphabets (a-z characters only) followed by an integer N, separated by a blankspace. 1<=N<=k<=3000.  Output Output consists of T lines, each containing the decrypted string.  Example  Input: 3 rpcyetn 5 rathe 5 aabb 2 Output: encrypt earth abab 
Run-length encoding(RLE) is a very simple and easy form of data compression in which consecutive occurrences of the same characters are replaced by a single character followed by its frequency. As an example, the string S  aabbbbdaa would be encoded to a2b4d1a2. Thus encoded string is described as an ordered sequence of pairs (a, i), each consisting of an alphabet symbol a and an integer i. Each pair corresponds to a run in S consisting of i consecutive occurrences of a. In this problem, we are interested in finding the minimum number of mutation(s) needed to transform first string given in encoded form into second string i.e. edit distance when only two operation are allowed  Add any character at any position(insertion) Remove any character from any position(deletion)  The cost of inserting a character is 1 and cost of deleting a character is 2.  Input The input file contains several test cases. The first line of the input denotes the number of test cases, T (1≤T≤100) to follow. Each test case begins on a new line and consists of an integer L1, a blankspace and a run length encoded string S1 and then on a new line, an integer L2, a blankspace and a run length encoded string S2. L1 and L2 denote the number of runs in strings S1 and S2 respectively. 1<=L1,L2<=100. S1 and S2 consists of alphabets [a-z] followed by number of consecutive occurrences of  that character. You can safely assume that the total length of any of the strings will not exceed 3000 characters.  Output For each test case, output the edit distance from S1 to S2 in a new line.   Example  Input: 2 2 a3b2 1 b3 3 a1b1a1 1 a2 Output: 7 2

 The Head Chef is receiving a lot of orders for cooking the best of the problems lately. For this, he organized an hiring event to hire some talented Chefs. He gave the following problem to test the skills of the participating Chefs. Can you solve this problem and be eligible for getting hired by Head Chef.   A non-negative number n is said to be magical if it satisfies the following property. Let S denote the multi-set of numbers corresponding to the non-empty subsequences of the digits of the number n in decimal representation. Please note that the numbers in the set S can have leading zeros. Let us take an element s of the multi-set S, prod(s) denotes the product of all the digits of number s in decimal representation. The number n will be called magical if sum of prod(s) for all elements s in S, is even.  For example, consider a number 246, its all possible non-empty subsequence will be S = {2, 4, 6, 24, 46, 26, 246}. Products of digits of these subsequences will be {prod(2) = 2, prod(4) = 4, prod(6) = 6, prod(24) = 8, prod(46) = 24, prod(26) = 12, prod(246) = 48, i.e. {2, 4, 6, 8, 24, 12, 48}. Sum of all of these is 104, which is even. Hence 246 is a magical number.  Please note that multi-set S can contain repeated elements, e.g. if number is 55, then S = {5, 5, 55}. Products of digits of these subsequences will be {prod(5) = 5, prod(5) = 5, prod(55) = 25}, i.e. {5, 5, 25}. Sum of all of these is 35 which is odd. Hence 55 is not a magical number.  Consider a number 204, then S = {2, 0, 4, 20, 04, 24, 204}. Products of digits of these subsequences will be {2, 0, 4, 0, 0, 8, 0}. Sum of all these elements will be 14 which is even. So 204 is a magical number.   The task was to simply find the K^th magical number.   Input  First line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each of the next T lines contains a single integer K.   Output For each test case, print a single integer corresponding to the K^th magical number.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^12.   Example Input: 2 2 5  Output: 2 8  Explanation Example case 1. 2 is the 2^nd magical number, since it satisfies the property of the magical number. The first magical number will be of course 0.  
Chef has an array A consisting of N integers. He also has an intger K. Chef wants you to find out number of different arrays he can obtain from array A by applying the following operation exactly K times.  Pick some element in the array and multiply it by -1   As answer could be quite large, print it modulo 10^9 + 7.   Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers N, K as defined above. The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the elements of the array.   Output  For each test case, output a single line containing an integer corresponding to the number of different arrays Chef can get modulo 10^9 + 7.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ N, K ≤ 10^5 -10^6 ≤ Ai ≤ 10^6   Example Input: 3 1 3 100 3 1 1 2 1 3 2 1 2 1  Output: 1 3 4  Explanation Example case 1. Chef has only one element and must apply the operation 3 times to it. After applying the operations, he will end up with -100. That is the only array he will get.  Example case 2. Chef can apply operation to one of three elements. So, he can obtain three different arrays.  Example case 3. Note that other than applying operation to positions (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), Chef can also apply the operation twice on some element and get the original.  In summary, Chef can get following four arrays.  [1, 2, 1] [-1, -2, 1] [-1, 2, -1] [1, -2, -1]

Chef has recently noticed that demand for brownie is increasing rapidly. So, he decided to install N machines to cater to the increasing demand. All machines are numbered from 1 to N. To use the machines, Chef has to enter two numbers l and r, such that all the machines numbered from l to r inclusive produce a single brownie. Now, you are given N numbers where the i^th number denotes the number of brownies produced by i^th machine till now. After that, there will be M queries where each query contains two numbers l and r. Now, our Chef wants to know how many brownies have been produced till now by each machine after M queries.  Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two space separated integer N and M.The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the number of brownies produced by each machine before queries.Then M lines follow where each line contains two space separated integer l and r".   Output  For each test case, output a single line containing N space separated integers denoting the numbers of brownies produced by each machine after all the M queries.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 30 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ M ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ Ai ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ N   Example Input: 1 8 4 2 3 4 6 9 1 7 8 2 4 3 7 1 5 7 8  Output: 3 5 7 9 11 2 9 9    Explanation There is only one test case. After the first query, the number of brownies will be 2 4 5 7 9 1 7 8. After the second query, the number of brownies will be 2 4 6 8 10 2 8 8. After the third query, the number of brownies will be 3 5 7 9 11 2 8 8. After the fourth query, the final number of brownies will be 3 5 7 9 11 2 9 9 
 Chef once wanted to count the number of vertex disjoint cycle covers of a directed graph. A cycle cover is a set of cycles covering the set of vertices (A set of cycles S is said to be covering set of vertices if each vertex lies in at least one of the cycles in S). A vertex disjoint cycle cover is a cycle cover in which no two cycles have any common vertex. A cycle is a sequence of t > 1 distinct vertices a1, a2, ..., at such that there is an edge from ai to ai+1 for 1 <= i < t and an edge from at to a1.  Chef has a directed graph G containing n vertices and m edges. You have to help the chef in finding out the number of vertex disjoint cycle covers in it. As the answer could be very large, please print it modulo 10^9 + 7.   Input  First line of the input contains a single integer T denoting number of test cases. Description of T test cases follows. First line of each test case will contain two integers: n, m denoting number of vertices and number of edges in the graph G. For next m lines, each line will contain two space separated integers: u, v denoting that there is an edge from u to v in the graph.   Output  For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting the answer to the problem.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 5 1 ≤ n ≤ 20 0 ≤ m ≤ n × (n - 1) 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n u != v It is guaranteed that no edge repeats in the input. So all ordered (u, v) pairs (represending edges in the graph) appearing in the input will be distinct.   Example Input: 4 3 3 1 2 2 3 3 1 4 4 1 2 2 1 3 4 4 3 2 1 1 2 4 8 1 2 2 1 2 4 4 2 1 3 3 1 3 4 4 3  Output: 1 1 0 4  Explanation Example case 1. There is exactly one vertex disjoint cycle cover. ie. (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1) Example case 2. There is exactly one vertex disjoint cycle cover in this graph too. Collection of cycles in that cycle cover will be (1 -> 2 -> 1) and (3 -> 4 -> 3) Example case 3. There is no vertex disjoint cycle cover in this case, as (1 -> 2) is not a cycle. 
 There are n trees on a road in Chef's garden. Each tree has one of the three colours out of red, green or blue. You are given information about the colours of the trees by a string s. if s[i] is 'R', it means that i^th tree is red. Similarly 'G' denotes green and 'B' denotes blue colored tree.  Chef likes to create a beautiful pattern out of the tree colours. A pattern is called beautiful if all the trees of the same colour are continuous. eg. "RRBGG" and "GGBBB" are beautiful patterns, but "RGRB" is not a beautiful pattern because trees of red color are not continuous.   For achieving beautiful pattern, chef is permitted to change the colours of the trees. For changing the colour of i^th tree from any colour to any other colour, he needs to pay a cost of c[i] rupees. Find out the minimum amount of rupees the chef requires, to create a beautiful pattern out of the colours of the n trees.   Input  First line of the input contains a single integer T denoting number of test cases. Description of T test cases follows. First line of each test case will contain a single integer n denoting number of trees on the road in chef's garden. Second line will contain a single line containing string s as defined in the problem. Third line will contain n space separated integers denoting the array c, i.e. c[1], c[2], .., c[n].   Output  For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting minimum amount of rupees needed to create a beautiful pattern.   Constraints  1 ≤ T, n ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ c[i] ≤ 10^9  Sum of n over all the test cases won't exceed 10^6   Example Input: 3 3 RGB 1 2 3 3 RRR 1 2 3 3 RBR 1 2 3  Output: 0 0 1  Explanation Example case 1. Pattern is already beautiful. There is no need to pay any cost. Example case 2. Pattern is already beautiful. There is no need to pay any cost. Example case 3. Change colour of the first tree to blue. Then the pattern will BBR, which is beautiful pattern. Cost required will be 1. There is no way to create a beautiful pattern by paying less than 1 rupee. Hence answer is 1. 
  Problem description. All the chefs live in the town of Chefpur.Chefpur consist of various localities with each locality having  some number of houses in which the chefs and their families live.Each locality in Chefpur is represented by a decimal number.Number of houses in each locality is given by the number of bits in the binary representation of that locality number.All the chef families are either good neighbours or bad neighbours.If in the binary representation of locality number, a bit is '1' then the corresponding family is a good neighbour and if the bit is '0' then the family is a bad neighbour.For example if a locality number is 5 then it can be represented in binary as 101.Thus the number of houses are 3(no of bits).Number of good neighbours are 2(as 2 bits are equal to '1') and the number of bad neighbours are 1(as only 1 bit is equal to '0').  Chefs in the chefpur wants to have increase harmony among themselves.Harmony is defined by the number of good neighbours which are present together  i.e the number consequtives '1' bits.  You are given two numbers l and r.All the localities in Chefpur are between l and r.Your task is to find an arrangement of localities so that the harmony is maximum in Chefpur.For eg if l=2,r=4 then the possible arrangements of localities are 234,243,324,343,432,423.  Help the chefs to find the value of maximium harmony that can exist in Chefpur.    Input The first line contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases to follow.  Each of the test cases have exactly two space separated integers,  l and r representing the starting and ending values for localities in Chefpur.  Output  Output exactly T lines i.e 1 line per test case representing the max harmony.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^5   Example Input: 1 1 4  Output: 4    Explanation 1 can be represented as 1 2 can be represented as 10 3 can be represented as 11 4 can be represented as 100 Arrangement 1 2 3 4- 11011100(harmony is equal to 3) Arrangement 1 3 2 4- 11110100(harmony is equal to 4) Arrangement 1 2 4 3- 11010011(harmony is equal to 2) Arrangement 1 3 4 2- 11110010(harmony is equal to 4) etc. Max harmony obtained is 4. ... 
 Problem Statement Chef is at a mountain range . There are N mountains lined up in a straight line . Each mountain has a height h[i] . Chef is currently at mountain a and wants to go to mountain b . He can do so by jumping from mountain a to b (he is talented ) . But he can jump from a to b only if there is no mountain between a and b whose height is strictly greater than that of mountain a . In this problem , you will be given the array h containing heights of mountains and several queries with a and b , you will have you answer whether chef can jump from a to b or not .   Input The first line contains an integer N, the next line has N integers denoting the heights of the mountains h[i] . The next line has an integer Q , the number of queries , Then q lines follow each containing 2 integers a and b.  Output For each query , answer "YES" if chef can jump from a to b , otherwise answer "NO" if he cant .   Constraints  1 <= N <= 10^5 1 <= h[i] <= 10^4 1 <= Q <= 10^5 1 <= a <= N 1 <= b <= N b>a   Example Input: 5 2 3 1 2 4 3 1 3 2 5 2 3 Output: NO YES YES   Explaination For first query the answer is NO because between 1 and 3 , the second mountain is of height 3 which is more than height of mountain 1 which is 2 . For second query there is no mountain more than 3 units high between 2 and 5 so answer is YES. For 3rd query there is no mountain between 2 and 3 so the answer is YES . 
 Chef goes to the market to buy a laptop. He enters a shop which has n laptops on display. Cost of i^th laptop is c[i].   Chef wants to buy a single laptop by paying least amount of money. But there is an issue: when there are two or more laptops available at the same cost, he gets confused about which one he should buy, so in turn, he can't buy any of those.   Find the minimum amount of money he needs to pay to buy a single laptop. It is guaranteed that there is always a way to buy a laptop.   Input  First line of the input contains contains a single integer T denoting number of test cases. For each test case there will be two lines. First line of each test case will contain a single integer n denoting number of laptops available. Second line of each test case will contain n space separated integers denoting array c i.e. c[1], c[2], .., c[n] as defined in the problem.   Output  For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting minimum amount of money needed for Chef to buy a laptop.   Constraints  1 ≤ T, n ≤ 100 1 ≤ c[i] ≤ 100   Example Input: 3 2 1 2 3 1 1 2 6 3 5 4 4 3 3 Output: 1 2 5  Explanation Example case 1. He can buy the cheapest laptop i.e. cost = 1. Example case 2. He can't buy any laptop with cost 1 because there are more than 1 (i.e. 2) such laptops and Chef will be confused in choosing. So he will choose the unique laptop with cost = 2. Example case 3. He can't buy any of the laptops with cost 3 because there are more than 1 (i.e. 3) such laptops and Chef will be confused in choosing. Similarly, he also can't buy laptops with cost 4. So he will choose the unique laptop with cost = 5. 
Every great chef knows that lucky numbers are positive integers whose decimal representations contain only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not. Our chef has recently returned from the Lucky country. He observed that every restaurant in the Lucky country had a lucky number as its name. He believes that having a lucky number as a restaurant name can indeed turn out to be very lucky. Our chef believes that it is possible to make a lucky number having N digits even luckier. Any number following the rules below is called Lucky lucky number -  1. The number contains only digits 4 and 7.  2. Count of digit 4 in the number should be divisible by 7.  3. Count of digit 7 in the number should be divisible by 4. Help our chef to compute the count of digit 4 in the smallest Lucky lucky number having N digits.  Input  First line contains T, number of test cases. Each of the next T lines contains a number N, the number of digits in the Lucky lucky number to be formed. 1<=T<=1000 1<=N<=1000000000 (10^9)  Output  If it is not possible to form a Lucky lucky number having N digits, output -1. Otherwise, output the count of digit 4 in the smallest Lucky lucky number having N digits.  Example  Input: 5 7 4 11 1 15  Output: 7 0 7 -1 7  Explanation For the last test case, N = 15, the smallest lucky lucky number is 444444477777777. The count of digit 4 is 7.  
 Problem Statement  Chef just went to moon , that too without any spacesuit ( chef is really talented ) , but when he reached moon , he discovered aliens living  there . Now chef is at a city 'U' on moon and wants to travel to city 'V' , but the cars which aliens use can travel only K units distance in a day.  In this problem you are given the layout of moon and K . Chef will travel from U to V only if the shortest path from U to V is atmost K units . Given a few queries of U and V , answer whether chef can travel from U to V in a day or not .   Input The first line contains 3 integers integer N and M and K denoting the number of cities , number of roads and The distance the car can travel in a day. The next m lines contain 3 integers A ,B , C denoting there is a bidirectional road from A to B of distance C. The Next line contains the number of queries Q . Then Q lines follow each containing 2 integers U and V .  Output For each query , if the shortest path from U to V is less than or equal to K then output "YES" , otherwise "NO" in a separate line . If its not possible to visit city V from U , then also print "NO" only .   Constraints  1<=n<=100 1<=m<=200 1<=k<=1000 1<=a<=n 1<=b<=n 1<=c<=100 1<=q<=100 1<=u<=n 1<=v<=n   Example Input: 4 4 2 1 2 1 1 3 4 2 3 1 3 4 1 3 1 2 1 3 1 4 Output: YES YES NO    Explaination  For 1st query , distance from 1 to 2 is 1 which is less then 2 so the answer is YES , for query 2 , shortest distance from 1 to 3 is 2 because chef can go from 1 to 2 (distance 1 ) and then from 2 to 3 (distance 1) , so total distance from 1 to 3 is 2 so the answer is YES . For 3rd query , the distance from 1 to 4 can not be less than 3 . so the answer is NO.

Tic-Tac-Toe used to be Chef's favourite game during his childhood. Reminiscing in his childhood memories, he decided to create his own "Tic-Tac-Toe", with rules being similar to the original Tic-Tac-Toe, other than the fact that it is played on an NxN board.   The game is played between two players taking turns. First player puts an 'X' in an empty cell of the board, then the second player puts an 'O' in some other free cell. If the first player has K continuous X's or the second player has K continuous O's in row, column or diagonal, then he wins.   Chef started playing this new "Tic-Tac-Toe" with his assistant, beginning as the first player himself (that is, Chef plays 'X's). Currently, the game is ongoign, and it's Chef's turn. However, he needs to leave soon to begin tonight's dinner preparations, and has time to play only one more move. If he can win in one move, output "YES", otherwise output "NO" (without quotes). It is guaranteed that no player has already completed the winning criterion before this turn, and that it's a valid "Tic-Tac-Toe" game.  Input The first line of input contains one integer T denoting the number of testcases. First line of each testcase contains two integers N and K, next N lines contains N characters each. Each character is either an 'X' denoting that the first player used this cell, an 'O' meaning that the second player used this cell, or a '.' (a period) representing a free cell.   Output For each testcase, output, in a single line, "YES" if Chef can win in one move, or "NO" otherwise.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 3 ≤ N ≤ 20 1 ≤ K ≤ N   Example Input: 3 3 3 XOX O.O XOX 3 1 ... ... ... 3 2 ... ... ...   Output: YES YES NO  Input: 1 4 4 XOXO OX.. XO.. OXOX  Output: YES   Subtasks  Subtask 1:  K  = 1. Points - 10 Subtask 2:  N  =  K  = 3. Points - 30 Subtask 3: Original constraints. Points - 60   Explanation  Test #1: In first testcase, put 'X' in (2, 2), in second we can put 'X' in any cell and win. Test #2: If you put an 'X' in (3, 3), there will be four 'X's on the main diagonal (1, 1) - (2, 2) - (3, 3) - (4, 4).  
The chef is fond of triangles. He has a task for you. You are given n point out of which only k are collinear. Find the number of triangles that can be formed from these n points. You have to perform the above task for a number of test cases.    Input The first line of input contains the number of test cases, t. Then t lines follow each containing 2 space separated integers n and k.  Output The output contains t lines each containing the answer for that particular test case. Each line contains the number triangles that can be formed for that particular test.  Constraints 1<=t<=1000 3<=n<=1000000 3<=k<=n  Example Input: 1 30 5 Output: 4050 
The chef has a book stand. He and his friend bought some books (say n). The book stand has only 2 empty shelves. The chef made an observation that the paper quality, the weight of a single paper and the dimensions of all the books are the same. The chef made a restriction, to the books that can be kept on the shelves. He said only m (an integer) books can be placed on the top shelf and rest of the books are to be placed on the bottom shelf. There is one more condition that has to be satisfied, that is, the difference between the sum of the weight of the books on the top shelf and the sum of weight of the books on the bottom shelf should be the most among all such arrangements possible. Your task is to calculate this maximum difference for a number of test cases.   Input 1.	The first line of input contains the number of test cases, t. 2.

The Chef and his brother own a rectangular field.  Chef’s brother wants to sell the field. He calls the Chef one day and says that if any dimension of the field is a prime number, he will sell the field. He tells him that he will measure the exact dimensions the next morning. The Chef does not want to sell the field. He knows that his brother is adamant and there is no way that he will change his mind.  So, he comes up with a plan to save some part of the field. He decides to measure the dimensions of the field in the night. If any dimension was a prime number he would reduce that dimension to the closest non prime number. Now, when the brother will measure the field in the morning, he cannot sell it. Print the area of the reduced field. You need to perform the above task for a number of test cases. NOTE: If the dimension cannot be reduced to non prime number, then reduce it to 1.   Input The first line of input contains the number of test cases, t. Then t lines follow, each containing 2 positive integers, L and B, the dimensions of the field.  Output The output contains t lines, each for each test case. For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the resultant field.  Constraints 1<=t<=10000 1<= L,B <=1000000  Example Input: 4 4 10 2 2 13 14 16 18 Output: 40 1 168 288

After this replace the character with the maximum frequency with '?' (without quotes). Then, print the resulting string. You have to do this for a number of test cases.   Input The first line of input contains the number of test cases. Then t lines follow, each containing a string s of lower case characters.  Output The output contains t lines, one for each test case, each containing the resultant string for that test case.  Constraints 1<=t<=100 1<=|S|<=1000, |S| is the length of the string S.  Example Input: 1 aba Output: ?b? 
 Problem description.  time given to them. The faculty has thus decided to encode the questions, which the students will then have to decode. They have decided to enlist your help in this - don’t get too happy, you won’t be told the questions which will be coming in your exam. Given the question and an integer N, you are supposed to find the encoded question, such that each letter of the alphabet in the question will be offset by that integer N. For example if the integer is 2, a will become c. If the offset goes beyond z, start again from a, so y will become a. You have to preserve the case of each letter, and leave all other characters unchanged.    Input The first line of input contains an integer T, the number of test cases. The first line of each test case will consist of an integer N, the offset integer. The next line will have the question string, consisting of English alphabets, the question mark character ‘?’, and the comma character ‘,’ and the space character.  Output For each test case, output the encoded question on a line by itself.   Constraints  1 <= T <= 100 1 <= length of questing string <= 10^5 1 <= N <= 10^6    Example Input: 1 1 What is your name?   Output: Xibu jt zpvs obnf?    .ques{ text-align:justify;}

Gru has not been in the limelight for a long time and is, therefore, planning something particularly nefarious. Frustrated by his minions' incapability which has kept him away from the limelight, he has built a transmogrifier — a machine which mutates minions.   Each minion has an intrinsic characteristic value (similar to our DNA), which is an integer. The transmogrifier adds an integer K to each of the minions' characteristic value.   Gru knows that if the new characteristic value of a minion is divisible by 7, then it will have Wolverine-like mutations.   Given the initial characteristic integers of N minions, all of which are then transmogrified, find out how many of them become Wolverine-like.   Input Format: The first line contains one integer, T, which is the number of test cases. Each test case is then described in two lines. The first line contains two integers N and K, as described in the statement. The next line contains N integers, which denote the initial characteristic values for the minions.  Output Format: For each testcase, output one integer in a new line, which is the number of Wolverine-like minions after the transmogrification.  Constraints:  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ N ≤ 100 1 ≤ K ≤ 100 All initial characteristic values lie between 1 and 10^5, both inclusive.   Example  Input: 1 5 10 2 4 1 35 1  Output: 1  Explanation: After transmogrification, the characteristic values become {12,14,11,45,11}, out of which only 14 is divisible by 7. So only the second minion becomes Wolverine-like. 
 Petr is organizing Petr Mitrichev Contest #11. The top N coders according to codechef ratings (excluding Petr himself) agreed to participate in the contest. The participants have been ranked from 0 to N-1 according to their ratings. Petr had asked each participant to choose a coder with rating higher than himself/ herself, whom he/she would like to be team-mates with, and the i^th ranked coder's choice is stored as choice[i]. As expected, programmers turned out to be lazy, and only a few of them actually filled in their choices. If choice[i] = -1, then it means the i^th coder was lazy and did not fill his/her choice. Of course, the top-ranked person (i.e., rank = 0),  Gennady Korotkevich  (obviously), despite clearly not being a lazy person, was not able to fill any choice, because he is the top ranked coder, so choice[0] is always equal to -1.   Petr, being the organizer, had to undertake the arduous task of filling in the choices for the lazy participants. Unfortunately, he also got lazy and adopted the following random strategy:   For each lazy person i (i.e., for all i > 0, such that choice[i] = -1), he flips an unbiased coin (i.e. with 1/2 probability it lands Heads, and with 1/2 probability it lands Tails). Notice that no coin is flipped for i If it lands Heads, he will not change the choice of this person. That is, he leaves choice[i] as -1.   Otherwise, if it lands Tails, he will uniformly at random select one of the top i ranked participants as choice of i^th person. That is, he sets choice[i] = j, where j is randomly and uniformly chosen from 0 to i-1, inclusive.   After this process of filling the choice array, Petr is wondering about the maximum number of teams he can have such that all the valid choices are respected (i.e. if choice[i] = j and j != -1, then i and j should be in the same team). Petr now has to arrange for computers. As each team will need a computer, he wants to know the expected value of maximum number of teams. As he is too busy in organizing this contest, can you please help him?   Input: The first line of input contains T, the number of test cases. Each test case contains 2 lines. The first line contains a single integer N. The second line contains N integers, which specify the choice array: choice[0], choice[1],..,choice[N-1].  Output: Each test case's output must be in a new line and must be 1 number which is the expected number of teams. Your answer should be within an absolute error of 10^-6 from the correct answer.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000 The sum of all the T Ns in one test file ≤ 5000 -1 ≤ choice[i] ≤ i-1 , for all 0 ≤ i < N choice[0] will be equal to -1, always   Example Input: 1 5 -1 -1 1 2 1  Output: 1.5  Explanation: choice[2] = 1 implies 1 and 2 should be in the same team. choice[3] = 2 implies that 2 and 3 have to be in the same team. Therefore, 1, 2 and 3 have to be in the same team. Also, choice[4] = 1 implies that 1 and 4 have to be in the same team, which means that 1, 2, 3 and 4 — all have to be in the same team. The only lazy person is 1. So with probability 1/2, Petr leaves his choice unchanged, or with the remaining 1/2 probability, he assigns choice[1] = 0, as 0 is the only higher ranked person for 1. In the first case, you can get 2 teams: {0} and {1, 2, 3 ,4}. In the second case, because choice[1] = 0, 0 and 1 are forced to be in the same team, and hence {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} is the only possible team. Therefore, with 1/2 probability, number of teams = 1 and with another 1/2 probability, it is 2. Hence, expected number of teams = (1/2 * 1) + (1/2 * 2) = 1.5. 
Jimma the cat had placed N bowls of cat food in a line. The amount of food in each bowl is an integer and is given to you as the array A[1], A[2], ... , A[N], where A[1] is the amount of food in the leftmost bowl, and A[N] is the amount in the rightmost bowl.   But Chingam the kitten doesn't like unsorted sequences. In general, for an arbitrary sequence B[1], B[2], ... , B[N], Chingam's unhappiness is defined as the number of inversions in that sequence. That is, unhappiness = number of pairs (i,j), such that i < j and B[i] > B[j].   Now, Chingam wants to take the bowls from the old line and create a new line with them, possibly re-ordered, so that his unhappiness is minimized. ie. let's say that after re-ordering, the bowls form the sequence P[1], P[2], ... , P[N]. That is, P[1] is the amount of food in the leftmost bowl of the new line and P[N] is the amount of food in the rightmost bowl of the new line. Then he wants to minimize his unhappiness with respect to this array P. Note that P[1], P[2], ... , P[N] will be a permutation of A[1], A[2], ... , A[N].   But he follows a peculiar method to build the new line (which is initially empty) from the old line of bowls. He takes one bowl at a time from the old line and places it in the new line. Due to the limitations of his paws, Chingam can only pick a bowl which is the current leftmost or rightmost in the old line for each step. And he can place it only at the current right or left end of the new line.  By doing this, Chingam gets a new sequence P[1], P[2], ... , P[N]. He wants to minimize his unhappiness with respect to this new sequence.   Find out the minimum unhappiness that Chingam has to bear.   Input Format: The first line contains one integer, T, the number of test cases. For each test case: The first line contains a single integer, N. The next line contains N integers: A[1], A[2], ... , A[N].  Output Format: Output one integer in a new line for each testcase: the minimum unhappiness achievable.  Constraints:  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ N ≤ 100 0 ≤ A[i] ≤ 1000, for all i in 1 to N.   Example:  Input: 1 6 5 3 4 3 2 7  Output: 1  Explanation: We show a sequence of moves which gives unhappiness = 1:  Old Line = 5 3 4 3 2 7 New Line = Empty  Old Line = 3 4 3 2 7 New Line = 5  Old Line = 3 4 3 2 New Line = 5 7  Old Line = 4 3 2 New Line = 3 5 7  Old Line = 3 2 New Line = 4 3 5 7  Old Line = 2 New Line = 3 4 3 5 7  Old Line = Empty New Line = 2 3 4 3 5 7 Now, in this new line, i = 3 and j = 4 is the only pair which satisfies i < j and P[i] > P[j]. Therefore, the unhappiness of this sequence is 1. You can verify that this is the minimum possible.  
You are given N lines (which extend indefinitely in both directions) on the X-Y plane. Some of these lines intersect with each other and others don't (parallel lines). We call each such intersection, an intersection point. You have to find the K^th intersection from the bottom.   In particular, you have to output the smallest value V, such that there are at least K intersection points whose Y-coordinate is ≤ V.   If m lines intersect at a particular point, that point is counted m(m-1)/2 times. That is, if only two lines intersect at a point, it is counted as one intersection point. But if three lines intersect at the same point, it is counted as 3 intersection points: one for each pair.   You are guaranteed that all the N lines are distinct, and that there are at least K intersection points between the lines.   Input Format:  The first line contains the two integers N and K.   The next N lines contain two space separated integers each. The (i+1)^th line contains Mi and Ci, such that the equation y = Mi*x + Ci, denotes the i^th line.   Output Format:  Output one value denoting V as defined in the problem, which should be within 10^-2 of the correct answer.   Constraints:  1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 K  ≥ 1 It is guaranteed that there are at least K intersection points. That is, 1 ≤ K ≤ number of intersection points in the input data -20000 ≤ Mi ≤ 20000 and Mi ≠ 0 -20000 ≤ Ci ≤ 20000 It is guaranteed that there are no i and j, such that i ≠ j and (Mi = Mj) and (Ci = Cj)   Example:  Input 1: 4 6 -1 2 -3 -1 3 1 -4 1  Output 1: 3.5  Explanation: There are 6 intersection points in total. Therefore, we want the y-coordinate of the highest intersection point. We see that the highest intersection point is (-1.5,3.5), and hence the answer is 3.5.   Input 2: 4 3 -10 -6 -5 -10 2 1 4 -8  Output 2: -7.429 
 You are in a magically discrete 2D world: an H * W grid containing H rows and W columns of cells.  There are rocks at various positions (x, y), none of which can be at (1, 1) at the beginning, but there may be rocks in any other cell of the grid.   (1, 1) refers to the bottom-left cell, and (W, H) refers to the top-right cell.   The most interesting fact in this magic 2D world is that the rocks are falling down without any acceleration! More specifically, a rock which is at (x, y) at time t will be at (x, y - 1) at time t+1 and it will disappear once y becomes 0.   At time t = 0, you are at the bottom-left cell of the grid denoted as (1, 1). (Note that this means that there is no rock at the starting point (1, 1) at the beginning.) You need to move left or right or stay at the same position in order to avoid being hit by a rock. That is, if you are at (x, 1) at time t, you could be at any of the cells (x - 1, 1), (x, 1), or (x + 1, 1) at time t + 1,  assuming that cell exists.   Along with space, time is also discrete in this magic world. In other words, this world is quantum physics gone berserk! At every second, you make your move, and then the rocks fall 1 cell down. So you should make sure that when you move to a cell at time (t + 1), there is no rock in that cell at time t as well as (t + 1).   We are interested in computing how many different layouts of rocks you can survive if you always play in the optimal way after the layout is made available to you. The answer might be very large, so you only need to output answer modulo M.   Input The first line contains an integer T denoting the total number of test cases. For each test case, there are three single-space separated positive integers W, H, and M, in a single line.  Output For each test case, output a line with the answer.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ W ≤ 7 1 ≤ H ≤ 100 1 ≤ M ≤ 10^9 + 7   Example  Input: 2 2 2 100 2 3 100  Output: 5 12   Explanation When W=2, H=3, we can discuss the problem in three cases as following, where Y stands for you, E stands for an empty cell, R stands for a rock, and ? stands for either E or R.  (1) 8 layouts in total.  E? E? Y?  In this case, you just stay at (1, 1) throughout.  (2) 2 layouts in total.  ? E RE YE  In this case, you move to (1, 2) at the very beginning, and stay there.  (3) 2 layouts in total.  RE EE Y?  In this case, you stay at (1, 1) for one second, and then move to (2, 1). So, we have a total of 12 layouts which we can survive.

 Uncle Ben is a very kind man and is revered by the whole neighborhood. One halloween night a group of trick-or-treaters come by Ben's house. Uncle Ben has some treats with him but he sees that the children do not have equal number of treats. He feels that it would be unfair to give away the treats to just any of the kids. So he decides to line up all the kids and distribute the treats according to the number of treats that the respective child has, so that he may equalize the number of treats to the best extent. What is the maximum number of children that have equal number of treats. It is not necessary that Uncle Ben give all his treats.  Input  First line has two integers N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100000), number of children and K  (1 ≤ N ≤ 10^7), number of treats Uncle Ben has. The second line contains N integers sepearated by single space, c1, c2, .... ,cn (1 ≤ ci ≤ 10^6)  where ci is the number of treats i^th children has.  Output  Output  maximum number of children that have equal number of treats.  Example  Input: 4 5 5 5 3 1  Output: 3  Explanation: Uncle Ben gives two treats to 3rd child. So 3 children have five treats each. There is no way that more than 3 children can have equal treats.

Chimp has bought N blocks each with a specific height(h1,h2,h3,….hn) for workout. Let x1,x2,…….xn be an ordering of blocks where xi represents the height of blocks . A workout is consists of N jumps, the first jump is from ground to x1, then from x1 to x2, x2 to x3 and so on till we reach xn. Difficulty of workout is defined as sum of heights of all jumps. Height of a jump is defined as |xi – xi-1| when you jump from xi-1to xi. More specifically, difficulty of a workout is defined as  summation of   |xi – xi-1| for all i (1 <= i <= N) . Since chimp starts from ground, x0 = 0 Now he is interested in finding the maximum and minimum difficulty of workout he can achieve by reordering the blocks. Help Chimp find this answer.   Input  The first line consists of an integer T indicating no. of test cases. T test cases follow. For each test case, First line contains an integer N, the no. of blocks. Next line contains N numbers indicating height hi of each block.  Output  Output 2 space separated numbers, the maximum and minimum difficulty that can be obtained.

Pakistan Team is obsessed with match fixing. Their bookie Asif is writing a letter to them and wants nobody else to be able to read it. They use a simple substitution cipher to encode his message. Each letter in the message is replaced with its corresponding letter in a substitution alphabet. A substitution alphabet is a permutation of all the letters in the original alphabet. In this problem, the alphabet will consist of only lowercase letters ('a'-'z'). For example, if  message is "hello" and his cipher maps 'h' to 'q', 'e' to 'w', 'l' to 'e' and 'o' to 'r', the encoded message will be "qweer". Given the original message, determine the cipher that will produce the encoded string that comes earliest alphabetically. Return this encoded string.    Input The first line consists of a number t representing the number of test case. Then, t lines follow each containing the message that will be less than 10,000 characters. It will contain only lowercase letters ('a'-'z').   Output Output the Cipher message for each message.   Example  Input: 2 hello sachin   Output: abccd abcdef

  After coming to college, Harry decided to have a get together with friends. So he contacted Chahak who is a renowned event organiser. She is given the task of managing this lavish party. Harry is fond of eating and his friend Joseph is fond of cracking jokes. As per Harry’s demand, Chahak kept N food items in the party. It will take exactly ti minutes to finish the ith item. Joseph who is a comedian will crack jokes. All his jokes are of exactly 5 minutes. The problem she faces is that after tasting each dish, Harry needs a break of 10 minutes to digest it. On the other hand, Joseph being a very active person doesn’t need any rest but he wants everyone’s attention when he cracks a joke, so Harry cannot eat at the same time. Now Chahak wants to make an Optimal time schedule such that: 1) The party can go on for d minutes. 2) Harry must taste all the dishes. 3) Joseph should crack jokes as many as possible. Help Chahak to find out if it’s possible to make such a schedule!    Input  The first line of input contains T, Number of test cases.

  The war has been declared in the Clash of Clans and the clan's leader has designed a smart strategy to confirm his side's victory in this war. His strategy is as follows -  When any member of his clan member will attack at any member of the enemy's clan then the attacker's army will consist of only two types of troops - Lava Hounds "L" and P.E.K.K.A. "P"(as these two are the mightiest troops),  The attacker's army should be balanced, i.e., if the attacker's army consists of N troops then in any continuous section of the army the difference between the number of P.E.K.K.A. and Lava Hounds must be atmost 2.  An army will be represented as a string of Lava Hounds "L" and P.E.K.K.A. "P". Example : If the army consists of N=5 troops, then there are 14 possible combinations for a balanced army ( condition number 2 ). The Lexicographical Order of this is - LLPLP, LLPPL, LPLLP, LPLPL, LPLPP, LPPLL, LPPLP, PLLPL, PLLPP, PLPLL, PLPLP, PLPPL, PPLLP and PPLPL. All the possible balanced combinations of army of a certain length N can be ordered lexicographically with index starting from 1. Example for N=5, army at number 7 is LPPLP (see in the above example). Since the leader is busy in donating the troops to his clan members therefore he needs your help in finding the number(index) assigned to an army for a given value of N(number of P.E.K.K.A. and Lava Hounds in army). There can be large number of such possible combinations for a particular value of N therefore output the result modulo M.     Input  The first line of input contains N, the number of troops in the army. The second line contains the value of modulo, M. The third line contains a string of N characters "L" (Lava Hounds) or "P" (P.E.K.K.A.) that represents a balanced army.     Output  Output the number assigned to the army modulo M.     Constraints Example Input 1: 5 4 LPPLP  Output 1: 3  Input 2: 1 7 P  Output 2: 2    Explanation Example case 1.The actual position of LPPLP in the list of possible combinations is 7. Therefore 7 modulo 4 is 3. (See above example for the combinations) 
We know that there are so many calendar systems. For example, Bangla, Christ, Arabic, Chinese etc. This problem is about Decimal calendar. There are 3 months in this calendar. First month is "Hundreds". There are 300 days in this month. Second month is "Tens". There are 60 days in this month. And this followed by the last month "Ones" having 5 or 6 days depending on whether this is leap year or not. A Decimal year spans a full Christ calendar. That is 1st Hundreds in Decimal Calendar is 1st January in Christi Calendar. Similarly, 31st December of Christ Calendar is 5th or 6th day of Decimal calendar (depending on whether it is leap year or not).  A year in Decimal calendar is leap year if the corresponding Christ year is leap year. For example, the Decimal year corresponding to 2000 Christ year is leap year but 2001 is not, and again 1900 is not leap year too. A year in Christ calendar is leap year if the year is divisible by 400 or divisible by 4 but not by 100.  You are given a day in Christ calendar in DD-MMM-YYYY format (DD stands for day, MMM stands for first three letters (in CAPS) of the month and YYYY stands for the year). You are to give the date in Decimal Calendar format.   Input First line contains number of test case. Every test case consists of a date in Christ Calendar format in each line.   Output You are to output the case number and the date in Decimal Calendar format. Output the date and the month in the Decimal Calendar.   Example  Input: 3 01-JAN-1900 10-JAN-1900 16-DEC-1900  Output: Case 1: 1 Hundreds Case 2: 10 Hundreds Case 3: 50 Tens  Note First three letters for the months are: JAN, FEB, MAR, APR, MAY, JUN, JUL, AUG, SEP, OCT, NOV, DEC. 
Long ago during the Jurassic Park age, there was a company TopHunters, which used to conduct hunting competitions for the Dinosaurs around the world. Petrosaurus was believed to be the greatest hunter of that time and all other dinosaurs enjoyed watching the hunting videos posted by him in the forums ( yes, they had a website :) ). Many Indian dinosaurs used to post in sms language in the forums and annoy others. Vexosaurus was so annoyed reading the posts with numbers used in place of letters. He decided to correct all those posts, before the forums get Rusty. Could you please code for him and replace the following words in 1st column with their corresponding words in 2nd column     8ate w8wait gr8great 4for b4before           Lets not make this complex and just replace the words when they appear entirely as a word themselves, and not as a subpart of bigger words ( see examples for clarity ). A word is a continuous sequence of non-space characters. Disclaimer : This is just a fictional story. Any resemblance to real persons or company or dinosaurs is purely coincidental ;)   Input First line contains T [ number of test cases, around 50 ]. Each of the next T lines contains a sentence with not more than 100 characters [ 'a' - 'z' , '0' - '9' , space ].

Sircar is considered to be one of the greatest magicians of all time and you have a chance to get a lucky ticket to his show! Sircar shows you one of his most divine tricks of magical illusion. The trick is as follows: He has 2 decks of cards, deck A and deck B. Number of cards in deck A is N and number of cards in deck B is M. Deck A has cards numbered from 1 to N, while deck B has cards numbered from N+1 to N+M. He shuffles both the deck of cards pretty well, so we can be sure that no two adjacent cards have absolute difference less than 2. Now he shows you the cards of each deck one by one, i.e. , one card from deck A and one card from deck B. He keeps showing them till both the deck have cards. Once one of the decks is out of cards, it is replaced by infinite cards having the value 0. Now the cards are continued to be shown in the given fashion until one of the deck goes out of cards and this is the point where the magic trick ends. At this point, Sircar turns to you and asks, "Can you tell me the sum of the differences of every two cards that I have shown you during the magic trick?". As a brilliant mathematician and observer that you are, you need to answer his queries efficiently, so that you don't lose out on the chance to see the BIG MAGIC TRICK! Note: For every round, difference = value of card of deck B - value of card of deck A. Note:The input is very large. Don't use slow I/O methods like cin/cout  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. Each of the T lines that follow have two space separated integers, N and M.  Output For every test case, print out the answer as required. (Sum of difference can be negative too!)  Constraints  1 <= T <= 10^6 3 < N <= 10^8 3 < M <= 10^8   Example Input: 2 4 6 6 4  Output: 35 13  Explanation Example case 1. Let us assume the deck A after shuffling will be the 3,1,4,2 and deck B will be 6,8,5,9,7,10. Let us see how the cards are shown and answer is calculated :  card from A = 3, card from B = 6, difference = 3 card from A = 1, card from B = 8, difference = 7 card from A = 4, card from B = 5, difference = 1 card from A = 2, card from B = 9, difference = 7  Now A is replaced by infinite cards of value 0.  card from A = 0, card from B = 7, difference = 7 card from A = 0, card from B = 10,difference = 10  Sum of differences is : 3 + 7 + 1 + 7 + 7 + 10 = 35. 
Rohit just started his 3rd semester classes in DMS. One of the interesting parts of DMS is set theory. He has just learnt about Power Set of any set, which is the number of ways in which you can create a unique subset from the existing set. Two subsets are said to be different if atleast one element in both the subsets are different. Given the number of elements in the set, you need to print out the size of power set that can be obtained from the main set. Since the answer can be pretty huge, you need to print the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each of the T lines that follow have the number N denoting the number of elements in the main set.  Output For each test case, print out the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.  Constraints  1 <= T <= 1000 0 <= N <= 10^15   Example Input: 2 1 3  Output: 2 8  Explanation Example case 2.

Example case 2. For N = 10, F(N) = 4, as the factors of 10 are { 1, 2, 5, 10 }. Hence answer is No. 
 Problem Description   You are being attacked by hostile enemy forces, with knights and swordsmen charging at you. Being the commander of your unit, you have been given the task of arranging your elite archers and pikemen in a special formation.  The archers and pikemen must stand between two flag posts in a straight line (no soldier can stand beyond the flags). Each archer must have at least two pikemen by his side (one to his left and one to his right) such that he is at equal distances from both of them. (A pikeman may be shared between two archers).   The archers stand at given fixed positions and the separations between them may not be equal. You need to position your troops in the given formation using the minimum number of pikemen.   Assume that the minimum distance between a pikeman and an archer or a pikeman and a flag is 1 unit. the minimum distance between two archers is 2 units.   Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follow.  The second line contains an integer N denoting the number of separations.  The following N lines each contain an integer x, which is the separation of the current archer from the previous one.   The first value of x is the separation of the first archer from the first flag. The last value of x is the separation between the last archer and the second flag    Output  For each test case, output a single line containing  the minimum number of pikemen required.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 1000 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000     Example Input:  2 3 4 4 2 4 2 2 2 2   Output:  3 4     Explanation Example case 1: A possible formation can be : F---1---p---3---A---3---p---1---A---1---p---1--- F  Example case 2: A possible formation can be : F---1---p---1---A---1---p---1---A---1---p---1---A---1---p---1---F F = flag A = archer p = pikeman ---d--- = distance between pikeman and archer/flag

  They See Me Rollin  This input refers to this board  Output:       There are a series of zig-zag platforms, each platform of different length, making an angle of either 45 or 135 degrees with the horizontal. Let's say     there are n such platforms (like those in the figure). A ball is dropped on the top most platform. The ball rolls down the platform and falls on the lower     platform. The ball may or may not land on a platform, depending on the difference of length of the lower platform with the upper one. Finally the ball will     fall on the last platform and then into the box. Note that the ball may not fall into the box when the last platform's length is short, in that case it     will be a "fall-through".        For this program, you will have to specify the number of platforms n , the length of each platform and you have to determine which platforms the ball will     fall on. The last line of output will be a string specifying whether the ball will fall into the box or not. Print "SUCCESS" if the ball falls into the     box, else print "FAIL".     Input       The first line consists of an integer specifying number of test cases T. For each test case, first line will specify the number of platforms N. Then,The     next line contains N integers l1, ..., ln separated by spaces each specify an integer corresponding to the platform length as Pli = li√2. (i.e if l = 2     then platform length will be 2√2).       Output       Each line of output will specify the platform number on which the ball lands on. The last line of output will be a string, either "SUCCESS" or "FAIL",     depending upon the status of ball in the box.   Sample Input 7 7 2 8 10 24 16 44   Sample Output 1 3 5 7 SUCCESS    
  A guy named Cman attends the final grade of a high school. One day Cman decided to watch a match of his favorite football team. And, as the boy loves football very much, even more than linear algebra, he forgot to do the homework. Specifically, he forgot to complete his linear algebra tasks. Next day the teacher got very angry at Cman and decided to teach him a lesson. He gave the lazy student a seemingly easy task: You are given an idle body in space and the forces that affect it. The body can be considered as a material point with coordinates (0, 0, 0). Cman had only to answer whether it is in equilibrium. According to the teacher a body is considered to be in equilibrium if and only if the coordinates of the resulting vectors are prime numbers. So, Cman began to solve the problem. But later it turned out that there can be lots and lots of these forces, and Cman can not cope without your help. Help him. Write a program that determines whether a body is idle or is moving by the given vectors of forces. Note : The resulting vector acting on a body is the vector having x, y and z coordinate as sum of all x[i], y[i] and z[i] respectively.    Input First line of input will contain a single integer “T” representing number of test cases. First line of each test case will contain a single integer “N” denoting number of force vectors acting on the idle body. Next N lines will contain three space separated integer i.e. x[i] coordinate, y[i] coordinate and z[i] coordinate of force vector i..  Output For each test output the word "YES" if the body is in equilibrium, or the word "NO" if it is not  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000 0 ≤ x[i] ≤ 100 0 ≤ y[i] ≤ 100 0 ≤ z[i] ≤ 100     Example Input: 2 3 2 1 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 3 5 7 11 3 7 5 3 5 3  Output: NO YES     Explanation Example case 1.When we sum up the force vector i.e. sum up x[i], y[i] and z[i] we got 11, 14, 18 i.e. (2+4+3, 1+5+8, 3+6+9) so the y and z coordinate of the resulting vector are not prime so the body is not in equilibrium state. Hence, we print NO for first test-case. 
 Reversed number is a number written in arabic numerals but the order of digits is reversed.  The first digit becomes last and vice versa. For example, if the number is 1245,it will become  5421 .Note that all the leading zeros are omitted. That means if the number ends with a zero,  the zero is lost by reversing (e.g. 1200 gives 21). Also note that the reversed number never has  any trailing zeros. Your task is to add two reversed numbers and output their reversed sum. Of  course, the result is not unique because any particular number is a reversed form of several  numbers (e.g. 21 could be 12, 120 or 1200 before reversing). Thus we must assume that no zeros  were lost by reversing (e.g. assume that the original number was 12).    Input  The input consists of N cases (equal to about 10000). The first line of the input contains  only positive integer N. Then follow the cases. Each case consists of exactly one line with  two positive integers separated by space. These are the reversed numbers you are to add.     Output  For each case, print exactly one line containing only one integer - the reversed sum of  two reversed numbers. Omit any leading zeros in the output.    Example  Input: 1 24 1  Output: 34   
 A positive integer is called a palindrome if its representation in the  decimal system is the same when read from left to right and from right  to left. For a given positive integer K of not more than 5 digits,  write the value of the smallest palindrome larger than K to output.  Numbers are always displayed without leading zeros.   Input    The first line contains integer t, the number of test cases.  Integers K are given in the next t lines.     Output   For each K, output the smallest palindrome larger than K.    Example  Input: 1 808  Output: 818   
 Given two binary strings, A (of length 10) and B (of length 5),  output 1 if B is a substring of A and 0 otherwise.    Input  The first line contains the number of test cases n. This is followed by n lines each consisting of pairs of binary strings A and B separated by a single space.    Output  output 1 if B is a substring of A and 0 otherwise.    Example  Input: 1 1010110010 10110  Output: 1  
 Ramesh is contemplating putting a new flooring throughout his house, but he has an important constraint: no tiles must be cut in the process of tiling any room. The floor of every room must be completely tiled, and all tiles in a particular room must be orientated the same way. This will make it easier for him to count tiles in any room that he is in because he won't have to estimate, and subsequently, add fractions of tiles into the total. Of course Willard is quite happy to put different tiles in each room to make counting them more interesting. Fortunately, the dimensions of every room in Ramesh's house are integral(interger) number units on each side and every room is a perfect rectangle. As well, Willard has found a tile manufacture that offers a variety of tile sizes, all of which, by coincidence are also an integral(integer) number of units on each side. Of course, the tiles are rectangular. The manufacture, who offers the different sizes for aesthetic reasons, and not to satisfy the somewhat compulsive behaviors of the likes of Willard, is somewhat taken aback b y Ramesh's request that the manufacture guarantee that a particular size of tile will exactly cover a room (i.e., the whole floor is covered and no tile is cut).However, the manufacturer is business minded and asks you to write a simple computer program. This program will help them match tile sizes up for each room in Ramesh's house and thereby meet his request.   Input  The first line contains the number of test cases. Following lines represent a single room in the house and a possible tile to be used in that room. Each line contains 4 integer values. The first two values are the dimensions of a room and the last two values are that of a tile. No room is larger than 250 X 250, no tile is larger than 50 X 50 and Ramesh's house has no more rooms than 100.   Output  Each line represents the answer for a particular room(the first line for the first room, the second line for the second room etc.). If the room can be exactly tiled with the tiles of the given dimension then the line would consist of the word "yes" else "no".   Example  Input: 1 50 70 2 3  Output: no

  All of you know about Fibbonacci series. It is a series where F(n)=F(n-1)+F(n-2) and F(0)=F(1)=1; Now, when the professor was teaching Fibbonacci series, then a student had mistakenly copied the co-efficients and the starting values wrong. He wrote F(n)=2*F(n-1)+3*F(n-2); and F(0)=2 and F(1)=5; Now, he was getting the series all wrong. Anyway, he decided to name this series as 'False Fibbonacci Series' and he is now interested in finding the Nth term of this fibbonacci series. Now, he asks you for help and you being his friend, agree on helping him. Now find the Nth term of this 'False Fibbonacci Series'. As the answer can be big, print it modulo 10^9+7.    Input The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.

The series goes like 2,5,16,47. 2 is the 0th term, 5 is the 1st term and so on. 
  In the country of Numberia, there is a city called Primeland. Sherry is one of the rich inhabitants of the city, who likes to collect coins of various denominations. Coins in primeland are little strange , they are only available in prime denominations (i.e as coins of value 2,3,5 etc.).Sherry is taking a tour of the country but as he visits people ask him for change, unfortunately Sherry took coins of only two kinds of denominations(the coins are of Primeland), he has already made a lot of such changes but then he wonders what is the maximum amount which he can't give change for using the coins he has.Remember he has coins of only two different denominations and has infinite number of them..    Input First line of input will contain number of testcases,T.Following T lines will contain two integers c and d separated by a space denoting the denominations which sherry has while he is on the tour, both c and d are guaranteed to be prime.    Output For each of the T testcases output one number per line the maximum amount which sherry can't afford to give change for.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 2 ≤ c,d ≤ 10^6     Example Input: 2 3 5 2 3  Output: 7 1    Explanation For Test Case 1 : We see that 2 cannot be paid using coins of value 3 and 5. In fact we can pay the following series of numbers using coins of value 3 and 5. 3,5,6,8,9,10.....and so on. Clearly we cannot make change for 1,2,4,7. Out of these numbers 7 is maximum therefore 7 is the correct answer. Basically find the list of numbers for which change can't be made using the two coins given in the input and print the maximum of those numbers as your answer.

Petr is fond of many colours and so he decided to colour many sketches which he has made during his free time. There are N sketches made and K colours available. He can colour each sketch in any colour possible. Obviously he wants to add variety to the sketches, by making a deep contrast between them. So he decides to colour them making sure that no two adjacent sketches are of same colour as well as 1st and last sketch do not have same colour, 2nd and 2nd last do not have same colour , 3rd and 3rd last and so on. Find out the number of ways in which he can colour all the sketches. Each way is different in which different colour is used for that sketch. As the answer can be very large , find it modulo 1000000007.   Input The first line is T, which is the number of test cases. Each test case consists of N and K which is number of sketches and colours.   Output For each test case, find out the number of ways possible mod 1000000007.   Constraints: 1 ≤ T ≤ 100000 1 ≤ N,K ≤ 10^5   Example Input: 2 2 2 3 2 Output: 2 0

Two friends Alice and Bob were once quarreling among themselves as to who will get hold of the box of chocolates brought by their aunt. Alice, shrewd and cunning as she is, makes a plan to stop this issue and get hold of the box. She challenged Bob a problem which he has to solve then and there only in front of her. The problem is stated very simply as: Given an array of N non - negative integers  ai, and a number K, Bob can remove elements from either side of the array, i.e either from first or last, such that the resultant array satisfies the condition that max(ai) - min (ai) = K. He has to minimize the number of elements removed and hence find the length of the resultant array. The resultant array must obey the condition above after removing elements from the sides. If there is no length which satisfies above then print "0" (quotes for clarity). Input The first line contains T which denotes the number of test cases. Then for each test case we have 2 lines, N and K. Then the next line has N space separated integers ai. Output For each test case print the corresponding answer. Constraints 1 ≤ T ≤ 5 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 0 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9 0 ≤ K ≤ 10^9 Example Input: 2 4 4 2 3 4 6 3 3 1 2 3 Output: 4 0   Explanation: The first example, Bob doesn't need to remove anything as the whole array satisfies it. The second example, even if Bob removes everything, there is no possibility hence the remaining length is 0.

Rohan and Digits Rohan is very fond of digits (0-9). He has a maths project at school and was asked to bring something cool. So he thought of cutting out digits in a piece of chart paper and coloring them with different colors.While he was doing this, he noticed that, for digit 0, he had one hole in the chart paper. A hole can be of any shape. So, 0,4,6,9 all has one hole. 8 has two holes. Rest of the digits don't have holes. Rohan was thinking of writing some computer program to enhance his programming skill. But he needs to verify his solution. Help him. Now, as a programmer what you have to do is pretty simple. Given a specific number of holes x, you have to print the smallest integer having x holes in it. Note that this number should not have any leading zeros.  INPUT The first line contains an integer x, which represents number of holes  CONTRAINTS :   0 <= x <= 510   OUTPUT : For each test case, print the smallest integer containing exactly x holes in it. Note: Output can be very very long.  SAMPLE TESTS: INPUT-1:  0  OUTPUT-1: 1 INPUT-2:  1  OUTPUT-2: 0 INPUT-3:  5  OUTPUT-3: 488  Explaination for sample test case 3 : 4 has one hole, 8 has two holes. So total holes = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. 
Nikhil loves to play FlappyBirds (who doesn't!). He plays it on his brother Nitin's mobile since he doesn't own one. One day, as usual, Nikhil comes to ask Nitin if he can play the game. Nitin challenges Nikhil to write code for a puzzle he's been trying to solve for last three days. If Nikhil solve's it, he can play. But alas! Nikhil is not an expert programmer like you. He needs your help. Help Nikhil play FlappyBirds! The puzzle is simple. You have a 4 x 4 grid. Some of the cells in the grid are black and some white. 'b' represents black and 'a' represents white. Eg.             babb            bbbb            aaaa            aabb  The task is to change the color of at-most one cell to the other color (ie. a -> b, b -> a) so that you can form a 2 x 2 grid, with all cells of the same color.  INPUT  Input has four lines, containing four characters each. If the j-th character of the i-th line is 'b', that cell is black, and so on.  OUTPUT Print "POSSIBLE" (without the quotes) if it's possible to complete the task and "NOT POSSIBLE" (without the quotes) otherwise.   Sample Test: Sample Test 1 Input    bbbb  abaa  bbbb  aaaa  Sample Test 1 Output POSSIBLE Sample Test 2 Input    bbbb  aaaa  bbbb  aaaa  Sample Test 2 Output NOT POSSIBLE  Explanation for Sample Test 1 : If we re-paint the 1st cell at 2nd row, we can get a 2 x 2 grid of all cells 'b'. 
 Lazy Puzzle Aashish was sitting in a park with Chirag. Aashish wanted to prove Chirag about his puzzle solving skills and asks Chirag to give him a puzzle.  Chirag being a lazy person gives Aashish a lazy puzzle to solve. He gives him a sequence of n digits and asks him to make a number from these digits with each of the digit d used exactly once and all of the digits in the sequence should be used. The number should be such that it should have the smallest number of factors among all the numbers which can be generated using these digits. Leading zeros can be skipped and should not be printed in the output. If there is a tie among the numbers then give the smallest number among them. Help Aashish solve the puzzle.  CONSTRAINTS :   1<=n<=5  0<=d<=9  There will be at least one non zero digit in the sequence   SAMPLE TESTS: INPUT1:   	2 4  OUTPUT1: 24  Note for INPUT1: Among 24 and 42, 24 has the least number of factors(1,2,3,4,6,8,12,24).

Cersei And Her Energy Game Cersei Lannister likes to play difficult games but this Energy Game is little too difficult for her ,so you have to help her out. There is a one-dimensional road. The road is separated into N consecutive parts. The parts are numbered 0 through N-1, in order. Cersei is going to walk from part 0 to part N-1. Cersei also noticed that each part of the road has a color: either red, green, or blue. Part 0 is red. Cersei is going to perform a sequence of steps. Each step must lead in the positive direction. That is, if her current part is i, the next step will take her to one of the parts i+1 through N-1, inclusive. Her steps can be arbitrarily long. However, longer steps are harder: a step of length j costs j*j energy. Additionally, Cersei wants to step on colors in a specific order: red, green, blue, red, green, blue, ... That is, she starts on the red part 0, makes a step to a green part, from there to a blue part, and so on, always repeating red, green, and blue in a cycle. Note that the final part N-1 also has some color and thus Cersei must reach it in a corresponding step.  INPUT: First line consist of 't' number of test cases. The next  't' lines, each line has a string representing the road (each string has 'N' elements) . For each i, element i of string is the color of part i: 'R' represents red, 'G' green, and 'B' blue.  CONSTRAINTS: Following holds for each string in input:  string will contain between 2 and 15 characters, inclusive. each character of string will be either 'R' or 'G' or 'B'. The first character of string will be 'R'.  1<= t <=30   OUTPUT: If Cersei can reach part N-1 in the way described above, print the smallest possible total cost of doing so. Otherwise, print -1.

 After getting placed you went to a party, after the party you got very HIGH. So out of fun you collected all the N (numbered 0 to N-1) dustbins of your hostel and kept them in front of your room. You also bought infinite number of balls, Then initially you added some balls in each dustbin. Now being really high you started these three tasks 1) You can empty the whole dustbin(D). 2) You can add M number of balls to K^th dustbin 3) You want to know the total number of balls from i^th dustbin to j^th dustbin (both inclusive).   Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.  Then T test cases follow, each test case will start with integer N and Q, the number of dustbins and number of tasks. Then in the next line, you will have n integers giving the initial number of balls in each dustbin (which will be less than 1000). Then Q lines follow, each of the Q lines will contain two or three integers, the first of them will be the task type If task type is 1, then 1 will be followed by single integer(D), the dustbin to be emptied. If task type is 2, then 2 will be followed by two integers(K and M), specifying that M balls are to be added to the K^th dustbin. If task type is 3, then 3 will be followed be two integers(i and j), range for which the total count of number of balls is to be retrieved.   Output For each test case,  if the task type is 1, then output the number of balls that have been removed from that dustbin to make it empty and if task type is 3 then output the total number of balls from ith dustbin to jth dustbin.

Chef while sitting at a coffee shop sees a girl making horizontal and vertical lines on a rectangular sheet of paper and then doing some counting. Chef being a maths freak, gathers courage and walks up to the girl to inquire what she is upto. The girl tells Chef that she has been given an arduous task of making M and N number of horizontal and vertical lines respectively on the sheet of paper and find the total number of quadrilaterals formed by it. Chef being from engineering background, knew a shortcut to solve this. So he tries to impress the girl, by telling her that he will make her task easy. All she has to do is to tell him the number of horizontal and vertical lines and Chef will tell her the number of quadrilaterals formed. If the Chef succeeds, the girl would go on a date with him.   Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each test case contains two space separated integers M and N, where M is the number of horizontal lines and N is the number of vertical lines.

You have a tree consisting of n vertices. You want to color each vertex of the tree in one of the k colors such that for any pair of vertices having same color, all the vertices belonging to the path joining them should also have same color. In other words, for any two vertices u, v with same color, all the vertices in the path joining them should also have color same as that of the u (or same as v, as u and v have same color).  Find out possible number of ways in which you can color the tree satisfying the above property. As the answer could be large, print your answer modulo 10^9 + 7.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. For each test case, first line contains two space separated integers n, k denoting number of vertices in the tree and total number of colors, respectively Each of the next n - 1 lines contain two space separated integers ui, vi, denoting that there is an edge between vertices ui and vi in the tree.  Output For each test case, output a single line corresponding to number of ways of coloring the tree.

Note that you can't color the tree in {1, 2, 1} as the vertices in the path connecting vertex 1 and 3, (i.e. 1, 2, 3) don't have same color. You can see that the color of 2nd vertex is not same as that of 1st and 3rd. In the second example, Only possible coloring you can do is to color all the vertices with color 1.

Aman loves solving English puzzles. His teacher taught him a new topic today called Contiguous Words. A contiguous word is a word in which all the occurrences of each letter of the word is together (i.e. no same letter should be separated by one or more other letters). For example, "aaabb" and "abc" are contiguous word. "bitotsav" is not a contiguous word since the 't's don't occur together. For the weekends the teacher gave Aman a homework on contiguous word. The homework is as follows: The teacher divided contiguous word into several parts. Aman has to form the original contiguous word and print it. If more than one contiguous word can be formed print "MORE THAN ONE". If a contiguous word cannot be formed from the given parts print "NOT POSSIBLE" (all quotes for clarity). Input Specification  First line will contain the no. of test cases T. Each test case contains two lines of input. The first line contains the no. of parts K. The second line contains K strings separated by a single space, denoting parts.   Output Specification  If only one contiguous word can be formed print the word. If many such words can be formed print "MORE THAN ONE". If no such contiguous word can be formed print "NOT POSSIBLE".   Constraints  1<=T<=300 1<=K<=50 Each part will contain between 1 to 20 characters, inclusive. Each character of the parts will contain only lowercase letters (a-z).   Sample Input   4 3 zzzz zz z 2 ro ar 3 ro a r 2 ac cca   Sample Output   zzzzzzz arro MORE THAN ONE NOT POSSIBLE  
The chef has just finished baking several pies, and it's time to place them on cooling racks. The chef has exactly as many cooling racks as pies.  Each cooling rack can only hold one pie, and each pie may only be held by one cooling rack, but the chef isn't confident that the cooling racks can support the weight of the pies. The chef knows the weight of each pie, and has assigned each cooling rack a maximum weight limit. What is the maximum number of pies the chef can cool on the racks?  Input: Input begins with an integer T≤30, the number of test cases. Each test case consists of 3 lines. The first line of each test case contains a positive integer N≤30, the number of pies (and also the number of racks). The second and third lines each contain exactly positive N integers not exceeding 100. The integers on the second line are the weights of the pies, and the integers on the third line are the weight limits of the cooling racks.  Output: For each test case, output on a line the maximum number of pies the chef can place on the racks.  Sample input: 2 3 10 30 20 30 10 20 5 9 7 16 4 8 8 3 14 10 10   Sample output: 3 4  
It's placement time at IISc! All students are busy studying for interiews and preparing their resumes. Lalit is also appearing for the placements. He has made a list of all companies along with their salaries, in the order of their date for placement(i.e the order in which the companies are going to come for placements,the salaries can be totally random). Being more mathematically oriented, he has also compiled the probabilities of his getting selected by each company. The placement process is as follows. Any student can write as many companies as he wants, as long as he is not selected by any company. Once he is selected by some company, his placement ends, and he cannot write any more companies. Lalit wants to devise a strategy such that he would write only those companies such that his expected salary is high. His strategy should take into consideration his chances of getting into a particular company and whether it is safe to not sit for a company in case he wishes to apply for a higher paying company. You must help Lalit decide which companies he should write, and which he shouldn't, in order to get the highest expected salary.    Input The first line of input contains 'T', the number of test cases (1 ≤ T ≤ 1000). This is followed by T test cases. Each test case consists of a blank line followed by three lines. The first line contains a single number 'N', the number of companies (1 ≤ N ≤ 100000). The next line consists of 'N' integers separated by spaces, which are the salaries of the companies, in order. The third line consists of 'N' floating point numbers separated by spaces, which are the probabilities of Pratik's getting selected by the companies, in order.    Output The output should consist of 'T' lines corresponding to the 'T' test cases. Each line should contain one floating point number, accurate to 6 decimal places, which is the best expected salary.   Example  Input: 2  2 10000 20000 0.5 0.3  3 40000 10000 20000 0.6 0.3 0.8    Output: 8000.000000 30400.000000  
Pratik has built a line follower bot. A line follower is essentially a robot which can follow a white line and the participant is graded based upon how effectively his robot performs the task at hand. Pratik decided to enter a Robotics contest to see how his bot fared over the others. The contest however had another small task that the bot was required to perform. The arena on which the robot was to be judged was a small 2-D matrix or grid with a black background and the lines of the grid were either red or white in color. The white lines formed a closed path, i.e. it always ended at the starting point, and no two white lines intersected. The robot was required to follow only the white lines and count the number of squares enclosed within this area. Pratik noticed red dots at the intersection of any two lines. These red dots were the corners of the squares in the grid. Pratik realized that his bot could still win the contest if he can write an extra piece of code which takes in the directions followed by his bot as input and calculates the number of squares enclosed. He reconfigured his bot such that it reported the direction in which it was travelling as and when it detected a red dot. So the input from the robot was of the form North, South, East, West. The dots were unit length apart. Help Pratik win this contest by figuring out an algorithm which takes in these sequence of steps and gives out the total area enclosed within this path.     Input The first line of input contains 'T', the number of test cases (1 ≤ T ≤ 1000). This is followed by 'T' test cases. Each test case consists of one line containing a string (of length upto 100000) which is the sequence of steps ('N', 'S', 'E' or 'W') taken.   Output The output should consist of 'T' lines corresponding to the 'T' test cases. Each line should contain one number, which is the area enclosed by the walk.   Example  Input: 3 ENWS ENWWSSEN NENESSWSSWWNEN   Output: 1 3 6  
Girish has recently joined IISc. Being a highly enthusiastic student he wants to attend as many classes as possible. He has prepared a list of classes he wants to attend along with their timings.

CUO01 - EASY Sorting   Problem description. Given an array containing a permutation of 1 to n, you have to find the minimum number of swaps to sort the array in ascending order. A swap means, you can exchange any two elements of the array. For example, let n = 4, and the array be 4 2 3 1, then you can sort it in ascending order in just 1 swaps (by swapping 4 and 1).     Input Input description. Input starts with an integer T (<= 100), denoting the number of test cases. Each case contains two lines, the first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100). The next line contains n integers separated by spaces. You may assume that the array will always contain a permutation of 1 to n.   Output Output description. For each case, print the case number and the minimum number of swaps required to sort the array in ascending order.  Example Sample input 1 4 4 2 3 1 sample output Case 1: 1 
50 POINTS   Each of you probably has your personal experience of riding public transportation and buying tickets. After a person buys a ticket (which traditionally has an even number of digits), he usually checks whether the ticket is lucky. Let us remind you that a ticket is lucky if the sum of digits in its first half matches the sum of digits in its second half.  But of course, not every ticket can be lucky. Far from it! Moreover, sometimes one look at a ticket can be enough to say right away that the ticket is not lucky. So, let's consider the following unluckiness criterion that can definitely determine an unlucky ticket. We'll say that a ticket is definitely unlucky if each digit from the first half corresponds to some digit from the second half so that each digit from the first half is strictly less than the corresponding digit from the second one or each digit from the first half is strictly more than the corresponding digit from the second one. Each digit should be used exactly once in the comparisons. In other words, there is such bijective correspondence between the digits of the first and the second half of the ticket, that either each digit of the first half turns out strictly less than the corresponding digit of the second half or each digit of the first half turns out strictly more than the corresponding digit from the second half.  For example, ticket 2421 meets the following unluckiness criterion and will not be considered lucky (the sought correspondence is 2 > 1 and 4 > 2), ticket 0135 also meets the criterion (the sought correspondence is 0 < 3 and 1 < 5), and ticket 3754 does not meet the criterion.   You have a ticket in your hands, it contains 2n digits. Your task is to check whether it meets the unluckiness criterion.    Input The first line contains an integer n . The second line contains a string that consists of 2n digits and defines your ticket.    Output In the first line print "YES" if the ticket meets the unluckiness criterion. Otherwise, print "NO" (without the quotes).    Constraints  1 ≤  n  ≤ 100     Example Input: 2 2421  Output: YES   
250 POINTS   Bhuvesh takes out his Snakes and Ladders game and stares at the board, and wonders: If he had absolute control on the die, and could get it to generate any number (in the range 1-6) he desired, what would be the least number of rolls of the die in which he'd be able to reach the destination square (Square Number 100) after having started at the base square (Square Number 1)?  Rules  Bhuvesh has total control over the die and the face which shows up every time he tosses it. You need to help him figure out the minimum number of moves in which he can reach the target square (100) after starting at the base (Square 1). A die roll which would cause the player to land up at a square greater than 100, goes wasted, and the player remains at his original square. Such as a case when the player is at Square Number 99, rolls the die, and ends up with a 5. If a person reaches a square which is the base of a ladder, (s)he has to climb up that ladder, and he cannot come down on it. If a person reaches a square which has the mouth of the snake, (s)he has to go down the snake and come out through the tail - there is no way to climb down a ladder or to go up through a snake.   Input  The first line contains the number of tests, T. T testcases follow. For each testcase, there are 3 lines. The first line contains the number of ladders and snakes, separated by a comma. The second is a list of comma separated pairs indicating the starting and ending squares of the ladders. The first point is the square from which a player can ascend and the second point is his final position. The third is a list of comma separated pairs indicating the starting and ending (mouth and tail) squares of the snakes. the first point is the position of the mouth of the snake and the second one is the tail. Multiple comma separated pairs of snakes and ladders are separated by a single space.     Output Output description.  For each of the T test cases, output one integer, each of a new line, which is the least number of moves (or rolls of the die) in which the player can reach the target square (Square Number 100) after starting at the base (Square Number 1). This corresponds to the ideal sequence of faces which show up when the die is rolled.     Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ Number of snakes, Number of ladders  ≤ 15     Example Input: 3 3,7 32,62 42,68 12,98 95,13 97,25 93,37 79,27 75,19 49,47 67,17 5,8 32,62 44,66 22,58 34,60 2,90 85,7 63,31 87,13 75,11 89,33 57,5 71,15 55,25 4,9 8,52 6,80 26,42 2,72 51,19 39,11 37,29 81,3 59,5 79,23 53,7 43,33 77,21  Output: 3 3 5   
Problem description: After failing to destroy the Republic with the 'Starkiller', Kylo Ren now wants to complete his mission with a new weapon. He wishes to use the mighty weapon 'Deathstar' to destroy the planets of the Republic. There are  n planets in the Republic, each present at a 2D coordinate (x,y). He has only one charge left in his 'Deathstar'. He can place it at any coordinate and fire it, destroying all planets which are at a distance of  M or less from the Deathstar. He needs to find a position to place the Deathstar so that atleast n/4 planets are destroyed on its detonation. Help him defeat the Rebels.  Input First line contains n and  M, the number of planets in the republic and the annihilation radius of Deathstar. Each of the next  n lines contains two integers x and y, the coordinates of the i'th planet.  Output Print space separated coordinates x and y, a location of the Deathstar such that it destroys atleast ceil(n/4) of the Republic's planets. If there are several such positions, any position will do. If no such position exists, output "Impossible" (without the quotes).  Constraints  1 ≤ n ≤ 100000 1 ≤ M ≤ 10000 -M ≤ x, y ≤ M     Example Input: 4 10 1 1 2 2 -3 4 -10 -10  Output: 0 0    Explanation Placing the Starkiller at (0,0) destroys all planets except the last one. 
Problem description: Sonu got bored of playing Solitaire all day, and has invented a new game of cards that he can play by himself.

Galileo's latest project involves determining the density of stars in certain regions of the sky. For this purpose he started looking for datasets online, and discovered a dataset on Newton's blog. Newton had decomposed the night sky into a Voronoi tessellation with the generators arranged in a grid. He has stored the number of stars in a Voronoi cell at a position in a matrix that corresponds to the position of the generator in the grid. This dataset does not directly help Galileo, because he needs to be able to query the number of stars in a rectangular portion of the sky. Galileo tried to write a program that does this on his own, but it turned out to be too slow. Can you help him?  Input Format The first line contains two integers n and m that denote the height and width of the matrix respectively. This is followed by  n lines each containing m integers each. The line following this would contain a single integer t, the number of queries to be run. Each query line consists of 4 integers px, py, qx, qy. The first two integers denote the row and column numbers of the upper left corner of the rectangular region, and the second pair of numbers correspond to the lower right corner.  Output Format For each query output a single line containing the number of stars in that rectangular region.  Example Input:  3 3 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 3 3 2 1 3 3 3 1 3 3   Output:  10 90 60 30

Given two times when seen on a digital clock, count the number of moments between these two times (both start and end time included) when the time was a palindrome. A digital clock shows time in the format HH:MM:SS (hours:minutes:seconds). For example, 2:40:38 pm is represented as 14:40:38.   Input The first line contains q queries. This is followed by q lines each containing two time strings, t1 and t2, which are 6 digit integers that represent times shown by a digital clock. It is ensured that t1 and t2 are valid times.   Output  Each output on a new line.     Constraints  1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5 t1 and t2 are of the form HH:MM:SS t1 occurs on or before t2     Example Input: 4 00:00:01 00:00:01 09:09:09 13:34:57 11:11:11 11:11:11 02:38:15 03:01:16  Output: 0 22 1 3    Explanation Case 1: Only 1 moment is considered in this case, i.e., 00:00:01. We can clearly see that 00:00:01 is not a palindromic string. Case 4: Between 02:38:15 and 03:01:16, there are 3 moments that are palindromic strings. They are 02:44:20, 02:55:20 and 03:00:30.   Note that the time as seen on a digital clock should appear as a palindrome. 1 is a palindrome, but 00:00:01 on a digital clock is not.

POINTS - 40 Harsh’s brother gifted him a big pack of Parle-G, but it’s too much for him. He doesn’t want to eat them all so to decide which out of them he will eat, he came up with an interesting way. Harsh arranges n biscuits in a line, placing each piece vertically upright like dominoes. In the beginning, he simultaneously pushes some of the biscuits either to the left or to the right.  After each second, each domino that is falling to the left pushes the adjacent biscuit on the left. Similarly, the biscuits falling to the right push their adjacent biscuits standing on the right. When a vertical biscuit has biscuits falling on it from both sides, it stays still due to the balance of the forces. The figure shows one possible example of the process.  Finally in the end, Harsh will eat all those biscuits that are left standing. Given the initial directions Harsh has pushed the biscuits, find the number of the biscuits he will eat. Input The first line contains a single integer n (1≤n≤400), the number of the biscuits in the line. The next line contains a character string of length n.  The i-th character of the string si is equal to •	"L", if the i-th biscuit has been pushed to the left; •	"R", if the i-th biscuit has been pushed to the right; •	".", if the  i-th biscuit has not been pushed.

The next line contains n integers, indicating the positions x1,x2, …xi,…xn of each troop (where 0 ≤ xi ≤ 100). The end-of-input is marked by a test case with D = n = −1.   Output For each test case, print a single integer indicating the minimum number of missiles needed.   Example  Input: 0 3 10 20 20 10 7 70 30 1 7 15 20 50 -1 -1   Output: 2 4  
Aman has a hardware store in Una. One day when he went down to the store room to fetch a box of nails. He found that the price tag had faded out. The first and the last digits of the price were not readable. Although, the number of nails in the box could be read clearly. The box read, 72 nails, Rs. _679_  What were the two faded digits, and what was the price of one nail?  Aman’s friend Arnab has great knowledge of computer programming. So Aman approached him.  He wants him write a program that solves the general version of the above problem:  N nails, Rs. _XYZ_  The total number of nails, N, is between 1 and 99, including both. The total price originally consisted of five digits, but we can see only the three digits in the middle. We assume that the first digit is nonzero, that the price of one nail is an integer number of rupees, and that all the nails cost the same price. Given N, X, Y, and Z, write a program that guesses the two faded digits and the original price. In case that there is more than one candidate for the original price, the output should be the most expensive one. That is, the program is to report the two faded digits and the maximum price per nail for the nails    Input The input consists of T test cases. The number of test cases ( T ) is given on the first line of the input file. The first line of each test case contains an integer N (0 < N < 100), which represents the number of nails. In the following line, there are the three decimal digits X, Y, and Z, separated by a space, of the original price $_XYZ_.  Output For each test case, your program has to do the following. For a test case, there may be more than one candidate for the original price or there is none. In the latter case your program is to report 0. therwise, if there is more than one candidate for the original price, the program is to report the two faded digits and the maximum price per turkey for the turkeys. The following shows sample input and output for three test cases.   Example  Input: 3 72 6 7 9 5 2 3 7 78 0 0 5   Output: 3 2 511 9 5 18475 0  
  You work at the prestigious atom-synthesis lab of DTU. You have been asked to make a new compound with N atoms and N+1 bonds, as according to a new theory these type of compounds are supposed to be more stable. However you are interested in synthesizing only the most stable compound.You may assume that an atom can bond to any number of other atoms.Also an atom may bond to itself. The stability of the compound is defined as the number of atoms in the shortest cycle in bond structure of the compound. Given N find the stability of the most stable compound that can be formed. Since the answer can be large output the answer modulo 1000000007    Input The first line contains an integer denoting the number of test cases , T. Each of the following T lines will contain an integer N indicating the number of atoms.  Output For every test case output the maximum stability that can be achieved modulo 1000000007.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^18     Example Input: 2 1 2  Output: 1 2    Explanation Example case 1. If there is only one atom, the atom may form two bonds with itself. In that case the stability will be 1 Example case 2. If there are two atoms, the atoms may form triple bonds between them. In that case the stability will be 2

Now you sell broomsticks of various lengths. You initially do not have any brooms.You decide to roam about in the city finding brooms and selling them. During each of the n days of your work as a brooms seller one of the following two events will happen:  1) You may find a broom of length L.You may or may not keep it.  2) You may have a customer ask for a broom of length L.You sell broomsticks by the length.Hence if you have the required broom of length L you can sell it in L rupees. The only problem is that you have a bad memory hence cant remember the sizes of more than 1 broom hence you never keep more than 1 broom with yourself. Now if you are given the events of those n days in advance, write a program to figure out the maximum amount you can earn..    Input The first line contains an integer n denoting the number of days.Each of the next n lines contain the description of the event on the particular day. If you find a broom of length L it contains "found" followed by a blank space and then the integer L.If you have a customer demanding broom of length L then it contains "demand" followed by a blank space and then the integer L..  Output Output the maximum amount of money that you can earn in rupees if you know the input schedule of events in advance.  Constraints  1 ≤ n ≤ 10000 1 ≤ L ≤ 100000     Example Input: 4 found 3 found 4 demand 3 demand 4  Output: 4    Explanation If you choose to keep the broom of length 4 and sell it you can make a profit of Rupees 4 which is also the maximum profit that can be made 
Crazy Boy had a tough Math exam in school today. On returning home, he realizes that he made a crucial error in the paper. In all the problems which involved calculating the determinant of a matrix, he forgot to multiply the minors with the sign term (-1)^(i + j), which resulted in wrong cofactors, and thus the wrong determinant. On further thought, he finds this slight error quite interesting and decides to calculate this new value obtained by skipping the sign term, for arbitrary matrices. Write a program that calculates it for him and makes his task easier.  Input The first line contains an integer N, the size of the square matrix. Lines 2 to N+1 contain N space separated integers each, denoting the values A[i][j] (j'th number in the i'th row)  Output Output the result modulo 10^9+7.  Constraints 1 <= N <= 20 -10^9 <= A[i][j] <= 10^9  Example Input: 22 -3-8 -1 Output: 22Input3 1 2 34 0 6-1 2 8Output88

A string X is a multiple of string Y if X consists of one or more copies of Y concatenated together. For e.g. 'abab' and 'ab' are multiples of 'ab'. Crazy Girl is interested in some specific properties of strings and needs to find multiples of a smaller string in a bigger string, but it is getting too cumbersome to do for large texts. Given two strings B and A, she wants to find all the substrings of string A which are multiples of string B and cannot be extended further to the left or right and are of maximal length. Help her by writing a program to automate the task. Output the location of the multiples of string B in the form of pairs (a, b) where a denotes the starting position of the multiple in string A (1 - based) and b denotes the number of times string B is repeated in the multiple.  Input The first line contains the string A and the second line contains the string B.  Output Output the required pairs (a, b) in decreasing order of a and output -1 if string B is not a substring of string A.  Constraints 1 <= |A| <= 10^6 1 <= |B| <= |A|  The strings A and B consist only of lowercase letters 'a' - 'z'  Example Input: aabaabaaabaaaba Output: 4 21 1Explanation:The pairs (8, 1) and (4, 1) are not reported because they can be extended further to the left and right respectively to form a multiple with two copies of string B. 
  There are a lot of hills on the surface of Mars, and you have information about the heights of N of those hills located one after the other. Your supervisor is now interested in finding the number of distinct heights of hills in arbitrary ranges. Your task is to answer his queries.   Input  The first line contains an integer N, the number of hills. The next line contains N integers, denoting the heights of the hills. The hills are numbered from 1 to N and the i^th integer ai denotes the height of the i^th hill. The next line contains an integer Q, the number of queries to answer. The next Q lines contain two integers each, xi and ri, where ri denotes the ending location of the range of hills for the i^th query. Let Qi be the answer to the i^th query, then the value of li+1, the starting location of the range of hills for the next query, is obtained by adding xi+1 to Qi. Q0 = 0 li = xi +  Qi-1 (for i ≥ 1)   Output  Output Q integers, where the i^th integer denotes the answer of the i^th query, i.e. number of distinct heights among the hills in range [li, ri].

 Crazy Bob came across a set of n transformers that are all faulty. Crazy bob decided to fix it in a crazy way. The n transformers are of 2 types. The first  kind can be fixed in a single attempt with probability A% and the second kind can be fixed in a single attempt with probability B%. You are given a string composed of characters 'A' and 'B' to denote which type of transformers each one is.  As always, Bob wants to show off his transformer fixing skills in a crazy way. While atleast one of the transformer is mal-functioning, he randomly chooses a set of k transformers and attempts to fix all of them. The transformers that are already working (in the set of chosen k) remain working. Of the chosen transformers that are still mal-functioning, the transformers that are of type A get fixed with probability A% and the transformers of type B get fixed with probability B%.  You are asked to find the expected number of steps Bob takes to fix all the transformers. One step is a selection of k random transformers from n.   Input  The first line of the input consists of the number of testcases T (T ≤ 200). Each of the test case starts with 4 integers n, k, A, B which denote the number of transformers to be repaired, the number k crazy-bob chooses at each iteration. A and B are the probabilities in percent. Constraints: 1 ≤ n ≤ 40, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, 1 ≤ A ≤ 99, 1 ≤ B ≤ 99,   Output  Output one number for each line - the expected number of iterations crazy-bob needs to perform before all the transformers are repaired. Your answer will be considered correct if the absolute difference between your number and the correct number is Example   Input: 4 2 1 99 99 AA 1 1 99 99 A 2 1 40 60 AB 2 1 100 100 AA  Output: 3.0303030303 1.0101010101 6.3333333333 3.0000000000  Explanation:  In the third test case, Bob randomly chooses one of the transformers (with 1/2 probability each) and fixes them. Thus he is left with fixing 1 transformer. Let x be the expected number of moves before he can fix the 1 transformer. So the answer is 1+x. To calculate x, at the next step, he  randomly chooses any  of the transformers (with 1/2 each). If he chooses the fixed  transformer, he has wasted the move and is back to x. If he chooses the faulty one, he has fixed both the transformers. Hence x = 1+1/2(x) or x = 2. The required answer is 1+x = 3. 
There are N cells in a circle numbered 1 to N in that order. Cell i is adjacent to cells (i-1) and (i+1) and cells 1 and N are also adjacent. You can cut the circle between two indices and you have to make two such cuts so that the circle breaks in to two arcs, with each cell in one of them. Each arc should have at least one cell in it. Given a circular array of N cells, find the number of ways in which you can break it in to two arcs such that sum of values in the cells in the two arcs are same.

 Congratulations!!! You have been selected as a contestant on the show, Programmer's Jackpot tonight. For one of the rounds in the show, you face a problem as defined below :  "For any positive integer 'X' , the sum of digits called as digit-sum of 'X', is defined as the sum of 'X' itself and its digits. When 'Y' is the digitsum of 'X' , we call 'X' a encore of 'Y'. For example, the digit-sum of 245 is 256 (= 245 + 2 + 4 + 5). Therefore, 245 is a encore of 256. But there are some numbers which do not have any encores, and some numbers have more than one encore. For example, the encores of 216 are 198 and 207."  Your task for this round is to write a program to find the smallest encore of the given integer.   Input  Your first line of input consists of 'K' (1 ≤ K ≤ 50) test cases. The number of test cases 'K' is given in the first line of the input followed by a blank line. Each test case takes one line containing an integer N , (20 ≤ N ≤ 100,000).   Output  The output of your program will print exactly one line for each test case. The line is to contain a encore of N for each test case. If X has multiple encores, print the smallest. If X does not have any encores, print "NONE". The following shows sample input and output for three test cases.   Sample Input: 3  216 121 2005  Sample Output: 198 NONE 1979 
 Everyone knows that electricity travels faster than anything. But we can delay an electric signal if we can make it pass through a grid of dense and resistive wires. So, this is your objective in this problem. You are given a square grid consisting of numbers. The numbers in the grid are the seconds by which an electric signal can be delayed if it is made to pass through that particular block in the grid (Be careful...Some blocks can actually increase the speed of the grid!!). You can reflect the electric signal from one block to only 3 other blocks as follows:1. to the block immediately below.2. to the block diagonally below left. (i.e. one down and one left)3. to the block diagonally below right. (i.e. one down and one right) What you need to do is to find the maximum delay that can be introduced in the electric signal. The constraints are that the signal can start at any block belonging only to the top row. And can end at any block only at the bottom row.   Input  The first line contains the number of test-cases followed by a blank line. The test cases won't exceed 50 neither would be less than 1. The first line of each input begins with the dimension of the grid. From the next line, the actual grid is provided as an input, the blocks in a row separated by a space and the new row on the new-line. There is a blank line between two consecutive inputs. Consider all the inputs as Integers (in accordance with the "int" in C language on a 32-bit system).   Output  The delays introduced in the electric signal for each input should be printed on a new-line.   Sample Input: 1  3 2 3 1 4 5 6 -1 -2 5  Sample Output: 14

 Two employees of a multinational company plan a conspiracy against the management . The major problem in their plans to take place is regular and secret communication. One of them comes up with a common but insecure method of encrypting text .What he does is to permute the letters of the alphabet. In other words, each letter of the alphabet is consistently replaced in the text by some other letter. To ensure that the encryption is reversible, no two letters are replaced by the same letter.You have been appointed by management to decrypt several encoded lines of text, assuming that each line uses a different set of replacements, and that all words in the decrypted text are from a dictionary of known words.   Input  The first line of the input consists of the number of test cases (within 1 and 50) followed by a blank line. The test case consists of a line containing an integer 'n', followed by 'n' UPPERCASE words, one per line, in alphabetical order. These 'n' words compose the dictionary of words which may appear in the decrypted text. Following the dictionary is the input text. There are no more than 1,000 words in the dictionary. No word exceeds 16 letters. The encrypted lines contain only UPPERCASE letters and spaces and do not exceed 80 characters in length. Finally every test case is separated by a blank line.   Output  Decrypt each line and print it to standard output. If there are multiple solutions, any one will do. If there is no solution, replace every letter of the alphabet by an asterisk.

 Crick and Watson was the duo who discovered the Double Helix model of the DNA with its "AT GC" pairing. Now while they were working on their project, they came across an intriguiging problem. The problem was that they found many combinations of the "AT"s and "GC"s in the DNA of the same organism. To their relief, this list was exhaustive. And now, they are stuck with the problem to construct the complete DNA of the organism from the combinations that they found. The problem is that, the combinations that they found ARE be a proper subset of the master DNA Model. So now, your job is to help the legendary duo in constructing the master DNA of the organism from the given combinations. The constraint being that the length of the master DNA model should be minimum.   Input  The first line of the input would consist of the number of test cases (within 1 and 20) followed by a blank line. The first line of each test case would consist of the number of "ATGC" Combination strings (not exceeding 20 and atleast 2) followed by the combination strings on each newline. Finally, there is a blank line between each two consecutive test cases. Consider that all the string input is in UPPERCASE. The input is in the priority order i.e. the importance order of the combination strings. Consider the order of importance of the combination string input ONLY if you get two master DNA strings of the same length.    Output  For the output, the master DNA model for each test case is expected on a newline. The output is also expected in UPPERCASE only.

In “Blackjack”, a popular card game, the goal is to have cards which sum up to largest number not exceeding 21. John came up with his own version of this game. In John's game, cards have positive integers written on them. The player is given a set of cards and an integer M. He must choose three cards from this set so that their sum comes as close as possible to M without exceeding it. This is not always easy since there can be a hundred of cards in the given set.  Help John by writing a program that finds the best possible outcome of given game.  Input The first line of input contains an integer N (3 ≤ N ≤ 100), the number of cards, and M (10 ≤ M ≤300 000), the number that we must not exceed.  The following line contains numbers written on John's cards: N distinct space-separated positive integers less than 100 000.  There will always exist some three cards whose sum is not greater than M.  Output The first and only line of output should contain the largest possible sum we can obtain.  Example  Input: 5 21 5 6 7 8 9  Output: 21  Input: 10 500 93 181 245 214 315 36 185 138 216 295  Output: 497 
I guess the most visited site of the past 3 months is www.cricinfo.com. First World Cup Cricket, then Australia tour to Bangladesh and now IPL T20. I believe there are lots of cricket fans among you. So I do not need to describe the game rule. But for the purpose of this problem here is short description of scoring. Any rule out of this problem description is not applicable for this problem. For this problem we will use only the following outcomes in a ball:   .cricinfotable td {    border: 1px solid #000;    padding:3px; }   Possible Outcome in a Ball Runs Is the Ball valid?   . (dot) 0 Yes   1 1 Yes   2 2 Yes   3 3 Yes   4 4 Yes   6 6 Yes   Wd 1 No   1Wd 2 No   2Wd 3 No   4Wd 5 No   Nb 1 No   1Nb 2 No   4Nb 5 No   6Nb 7 No   W 0 Yes    (Wd stands for Wide, Nb for No Ball and W for Wicket)  In cricinfo we always watch the score card. In cricket an over consists of 6 valid balls. A score card of an over may look like below:   1 . W . Wd Nb . 6   In this over there were 1 wicket and 9 runs. In the last over of second innings of a match, a team requires N runs to win. You are to output number of ways of the outcome of the over. Note that, as you are watching second innings of the match, so it may be possible that he can score N runs in first 4 balls and win the match. That means, it is not necessary to play an entire over to score N runs. Also suppose you do not know how many wickets are already gone. So it may also be possible that after a few wicket falls they are all out. Also note that, if a team scores greater or equal to N runs the team wins and does not play any ball.  Input First line contains number of test case T (T <= 10000). For each test a line contains N (1 <= N <= 10000).  Output For every test case, output the case number and number of ways of outcome of the last over where the team needs N runs to win. As the answer can be very big, so output in mod 10000007.  Example  Input: 1 1  Output: Case 1: 946

Sak and Pre are the two little sisters :) They love to play games with each other. Yesterday, Pre was stumbling online and she came across a new game called “Stone-Queen”. She immediately told about it to Sak, so she could play it with her. Stone-Queen is a two player game. The game starts with a pile of stones. Each player on his turn can subtract a “queen” number of stones from the pile and the subtracted stones are discarded from the game. A queen number is defined as a number which is either a prime or it has exactly two distinct prime factors. The loser is the player who cannot make a move. Sak is very intelligent, she figured out the winning strategy after a number of plays. But Pre is not able to figure out the winning strategy and so she is losing every time. Can you help Pre find out who wins the game given the initial number of stones N in the pile? Assume that both players play optimally    Input First line contains T, the number of test cases. Next T lines contains T test cases, each of which is in the form of first_player N”, where first_player stands for the player who starts the game and N represents the number of stones in pile initially.    Output Output T lines, each containing the name of player who wins the game.   Constraints 1 ≤ N ≤ 100000 1 ≤ T ≤ 10000    Example  Input: 3 Sak 3 Pre 1 Pre 4   Output: Sak Sak Pre  
 Turtur has started preparation for All Champions Mathematics Contest going to be held in Feb. this year. Although he is very good at mathematics, but his weakest among all topics is Number Theory. So he has been studying various Number Theory problems from past few days. He came across one of the problems called Excessivity of a number problem. Excessivity of a number is defined as the product of Summation excess function of every prime below or equal to that number. Summation excess function for a prime number is defined as sum of Excess function of all positive powers till power K of that prime number. Excess function of a number is defined as the sum of all divisors of that number (including 1 and itself) minus that number itself.  Excess(x) = sum of divisors of "x" – x. SummationExcess(P,K) = Excessivity(N,K) =  Turtur has found a very nice solution for this problem for some values of N & K. But since he is weak in Number Theory, he is unsure of his results and he wants to crosscheck his answers for given values of N & K. Since this result can be pretty large, just tell him the Excessivity(N,K) modulo 10^9+7.    Input First line consists of T the number of test cases. Each of the next T lines contains two integers N and K.    Output Output T lines each containing the Excessivity(N,K) modulo 10^9+7.   Constraints  1<=N<=10^6 1<=K<=10^9 1<=T<=10  Example  Input: 2 2 3 5 2  Output: 11 140 
City of Romini is one of the well planned cities of the world. Why? Because road network at Romini is great. The roads in Romini are built in a grid like fashion. Some roads in Romini have stall-walls from which people cannot pass through. One such arrangement of Romini grid road network is given in a figure below   The above network has 5 east to west roads and 3 north to south roads. “#” represents stall-walls. Stall-walls are only present at the intersection point of any two roads.  Nooji is spending her holiday in City of Romini. She was amazed by the transport system of Romini. They have a very weird rule of charging fare from commuters. For a travelling distance of any units in either a horizontal direction or a vertical direction, without a stall-wall in between source and destination, they charge 1 Rupa. So suppose Nooji wants to travel from S to D2 in above grid network system, she will only have to pay 1 Rupa. But if she wants to travel between S and D1, she will be charged 3 Rupa because she cannot commute through stall-wall and so she will have to go south first one unit (and pay 1 Rupa for it), then travel 3 units east (and pay 1 Rupa for it) and then finally travel 1 unit north to reach D1 (and pay 1 Rupa for it). So in total she will have to pay 3 Rupa.  She is so confused with this system! Being a travel planner for her, can you plan her travel between given source and destination so that she has to pay minimum?    Note  If Nooji cannot reach destination from source, print 0 as answer.   Input First line contains T, the no. of test cases. Each test case starts with two integers M and N in the first line, the dimensions of grid road network. Next line contains the integer coordinates of source for Nooji. Next line contains integer coordinates of destination for Nooji. Next M lines contain N characters in each line, the description of Grid road network. Note that all coordinates are 0 indexed based.   Output Output T lines each containing the minimum amount Nooji will have to pay for travelling.   Constraints  N<=100 M<=100 T<=100  Example  Input: 2 4 4 1 1 2 2 .... ..#. .#.. .... 3 5 1 2 0 4 ..##. ...#. .....   Output: 4 3 
 Silly is the chief of the secret department that works on Encryption techniques. YooTi works under Silly in that department. Silly is working on a new project. The project often requires the Exclusive-OR maximum to be found out on a set of integers with respect to another given integer called the query integer. So every time a query integer comes up to Silly, he asks YooTi to find out the Max (Ai xor B) where Ai is an integer from the set A and B is the query integer. YooTi is frustrated now because Silly gives too many query integers and she has to search out the whole set to find the answer. Can you help YooTi with this?   Input  First line contains N, the number of integers the set A. Next line contains N space separated positive integers. The value of each integer will not exceed 1000000. Next line contains Q, the number of query integers. Next Q lines contain the query integers B, one per line.    Output Output  Q lines 'corresponding to each query containing a single integer, the max(B xor A1, B xor A2,.......,B xor An).  Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 100000 1 ≤ Q ≤ 10000 1 ≤ Ai ,B ≤ 1000000    Example  Input: 5 5 8 12 20 18 4 1 10 20 16  Output: 21 30 28 28  
The legendary Sherlock Holmes needs your help in solving a case. He has been trying to solve the case of The Lost Number for a long time and using his exceptional skills, has been able to discover all N parts of the number. He also knows that the Lost Number is the arrangement of these N parts, that results in the numerically maximum number. Since he is very busy with other cases, he needs you to use your coding skills to  help him find The Lost Number. Given N numbers K1 K2 K3…Kn, output the biggest number that can be formed by joining these N numbers.  Input First line of the input contains the number of test cases T. For each test case there are 2 lines of input- The first line contains an integer N. The second line contains N space separated numbers Ki.  Output For each test case output a single line containing the maximum number that can be formed.  Constraints 1<=T<=20 1<=N<=100 1<=K [i]<=10^18  Example  Input: 3 3 4 1 8 2 231 942 2 59 542  Output: 841 942231 59542  Explanation for the second test case: 231 and 942 can have 2 possible arrangements 231942 and 942231. Since 942231>231942, the correct answer is 942231. 
Irene Adler is furious with Sherlock Holmes, as he is always busy with his work. So Sherlock decides to impress his lady love by buying her some gifts. He knows that he will have to buy at least K gifts. Miser that he is, he decides to go to the gift shop, and buy the cheapest K gifts available. The shopkeeper on seeing the famous detective enter his shop, decides to test his intelligence. He organizes all the gifts in the shop in N lines, each line having M gifts. To further add to Sherlock’s misery, he encloses the gifts in each row in a transparent tube, and tells him that the gifts are accessible only from the ends i.e. he can only pick a gift only if there is no gift to its right or to its left. He asks Sherlock to pick one gift at a time and challenges him to minimize the total cost of the K gifts. Sherlock, happy to have a challenge even in this boring task of buying gifts, accepts his challenge happily. Now he needs your help to pass the shopkeeper’s challenge and save some money. Given the cost of each gift in the N*M grid, find the minimum cost in which he can buy at least K gifts.  Input The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains 3 integers N,M and K. The next N lines contain M integer each, the cost of the items.  Constraints 1<=T<=5 1<=N<=100 1<=M<=1000 1<=K<=1000 1<=C<=100000  Output For each test case output a single line containing the minimum cost of K gifts.  Example  Input: 2 2 2 3 6 3 1 9 2 4 5 2 1 10 5 20 1 50 1  Output: 10 19 
Sherlock Holmes was trying to solve another murder case. He found a box that can be unlocked only by forming a pattern on it. Box has a matrix of LEDs of N x M on the top and K switches which can toggle some LEDs on the box. Sherlock Holmes being very smart already knew the pattern that has to be formed using the LEDs to unlock the box. He found this task a bit tedious so asks you for help. Given the size of the matrix (N x M), list of K switches and with each switch a list of position(x,y) of LEDs (0 based index) that will be toggled on turning on that particular switch, you need to tell whether pattern can be formed or not  Input First line of input contains no. of test cases T. And first line of each testcase contains N,M (the size of the matrix) and K (the no. of switches). Then K lines follow, first integer of each line is P (no. of LEDs it can toggle) and then follow 2*P integers denoting the x and y coordinates of the LED (like x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3 …..xp yp) Then follows the N X M matrix representing the final pattern. Each cell of the matrix will be either 1(ON) or 0(OFF)  Output Output of each test case will be a line containing “Yes” or “No” (quotes for clarity), “Yes” if the pattern can be formed “No” if it cannot be.  Constraints 1<=T<=100 1<=N,M<=20 1<=K<400 Note: All the LEDs are off initially  Example  Input: 1 5 5 4 4 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 8 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 2 1 2 2 2 3 2 4 8 2 1 2 2 2 3 2 4 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 4 3 1 3 2 3 3 3 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0  Output: Yes 
James Moriarty planted few bombs all over the city. But sadly there is only one bomb defusing squad, and is at a fixed position (X,Y). Sherlock Holmes was able to find out the positions of all the bombs. So all the bombs are to be disarmed in order to save the city. Since this is a very dangerous task thus no body volunteered. Sherlock is initially at position (X,Y) and can carry only one bomb at a time.  He has to bring all the bombs to the bomb defusing squad. Obviously he wants to do this task as soon as possible. Given the position of the Squad and position of all the bombs, you need to tell the minimum distance that Sherlock Holmes has to travel to save the city.  Input First line contains test cases T<=400. Then first line of each test case tells the no. of bombs N ( 3<=N <=1500) in the city. Next line contain the position of squad X Y ( X,Y <=100). Next N lines denotes the position of bombs- xi yi (xi,yi<=100).  Output For each test case output the minimum distance that Sherlock Holmes will travel.  Note: Bomb Squad is fixed and can not move. Initially Sherlock Holmes is standing with the squad. All the positions are integers. Minimum Distance between two points x1 y1 and x2 y2 is | x1-x2 | + | y1-y2 |.  Example  Input: 1 3 3 4 5 6 2 1 2 3  Output: 20 
Sherlock Holmes is chasing a cab driver and he(Holmes) is carrying a gun with which he can shoot the . cabbie. Both Sherlock Holmes and the cab driver are initially in the first cell (1,1) and the Jail is at (N,M). Sherlock Holmes will shoot the cab exactly one time whenever they both are in same cell i.e. whenever they are in the same cell, the strength of the car reduces by 1. The cabdriver’s car has strength equal to K i.e. after exactly K shots car will break down. So in order to save the pain of taking the cab driver to the police, he decided to break down his car at (N,M) i.e. he will take his last shot at (N,M). The size of the grid is N x M and none of them can go out of the grid. Also both the cab driver and Sherlock can either go to the left or down (i.e if one is at (x,y) then he can either go to (x+1,y) or to (x,y+1) ). Both Sherlock Holmes and the cab driver are travelling at the same speed. Given the size of the grid and the strength of the car, you need to tell the no. of ways Sherlock could have stopped the cabbie. Note: They are always together in the first and last cell. Two ways are different if path taken by at least one of them different in both ways.  Input First line of input contains T, the no. of testcases. Each test case contains one line containing 3 integers N M and K separated by a space.  Output Output of each test case is a single integer denoting the no. ways. Since this number can be very large, output the number after taking mod with 1,000,000,007 (10^9 +7)  Constraints 1<=T<=1000 1<=N,M<=50 0<=K<=100  Example  Input: 5 2 1 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 Output: 1 0 2 2 12 
  Your friend has recently started playing Battlefield, and is very impressed by the dynamics of the game. However, he's still a noob.  One of the things that he's struggling with is the bullet drop over long distances, while shooting with sniper rifles. You decide to help him out by creating an overlay game mod, which tells him exactly how far up to aim in his reticle to account for the bullet drop over various distances.  The drop is not noticeable till a distance of 100 meters, and after that the bullet drops 0.1 centimeters for every 20 meters. Given x, the distance between your friend and the enemy camper, output y, the deviation due to the bullet drop.   Input  The first line of the input contains an integer N, denoting the number of instances of the problem to solve. The next N integers denote x, the distance in meters.   Output  For each of the N instances, output y, the bullet drop in centimeters. y should have an absolute or relative error of less than 10^-6.   Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤  10^6 1 ≤ x ≤  10^8   Example  Input: 5 100 120 140 200 103  Output: 0.000000 0.100000 0.200000 0.500000 0.015000  
  Given a string, your task is to encrypt it. The encryption should be done using the following algorithm:  First, Swap the two halves of the given string.  If the string is of odd length, the character in the middle remains at its position. For example, the string "abcde" is converted to "decab", and the string "abcd" is converted to "cdab".  Then, for each character x of the resultant string, perform the following operations  Find the positional value of the character x. Let the positional value of x be p.  The positional value is the position in which the character appears in the English alphabetical sequence. For example, the positional value of "a" is 1, "b" is 2, "c" is 3 and so on. c. The character x is to be replaced by (p%10).f((p/10)+1), where "." has been used as a concatenation operator and function f(n) returns the nth position alphabet.   You may assume that the characters in the given string would only include lower case English alphabets.    Input The first line of input would consist of T, the number of test cases. T lines follow each consisting of a string that is to be encrypted.    Output For each test case output the corresponding encrypted text.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 1000     Example Input: 2 geucoders codechef  Output: 4a5a8b9b5b7a5a1c3a 3a8a5a6a3a5b4a5a   
Problem Statement Burnout, a popular gaming arena in Manipal, has come up with new charging schemes for all the students that game there. Since there are different types of gamers, they are always seeking for packages that are best suited for them. To have an edge over their newly arising competitors, Burnout provides various packages. Two of the most popular packages are:   Respawn Frag  Respawn charges every 30 minutes at a rate of Rs.10. That means if you play for 29 minutes or less, you will be charged with Rs.10. If you play for 30 to 59 minutes, you will be charged with Rs.20 and so on. Frag charges every 60 minutes at a rate of Rs.15. That means if you play for 59 minutes or less, you will be charged with Rs.15. Similarly, if you play for 60 minutes to 119 minutes, you will be charged with Rs.30 and so on. Given a list of durations that students have played for, can you determine the package that is cheaper?     Input The first line of input is an integer T, denoting the total number of test cases. Each case starts with a line containing an integer N. followed by a list of N durations (In minutes) in next line. Each duration is an integer in the range [1, 2000] which will be separated by a single space character.  Output For each case, output the case number first. Then output the name of the cheaper package followed by the corresponding cost in Rupees. If both package gives the same total cost, then output both the names (Respawn preceding Frag) followed by the cost. Look at the output and sample input for details.

Problem Statement   You are walking on the streets of New York when the famous illusionist David Blaine comes up to you. He is holding an ordered deck of 10 cards numbered 1 to 10 with card 1 at the top and card 10 at the bottom. He gives the pack of cards to you. He asks you to throw away the top card and move the card that is now on the top of the deck to the bottom of the deck and to keep doing this as long as there are at least two cards in the deck. When you are left with the last card in your hand he takes a minute and then says 4. To your amazement when you turn the card over, it is 4. How does he do it? Write a program to predict the last card when there are n cards in the ordered deck.   Input Each line of input (except the last) contains a positive number n. The last line contains 0 denoting the end inputs.  Output . For each number from input produce one line of output giving the last remaining card.  Constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000    Example Input: 8 15 23 9 0   Output: 8 14 14 2     Note : The reference for this problem has been taken from : UVa online Judge  
On a wonderful rainy day, a little champ was wandering in the street. He was so sad because he had no power to fight against the monster, meanwhile there was a magical rain with power-boosters, the value of each power booster is a positive number. The product of power boosters is a constant. Let us consider a1, a2, a3…..,an are the powers of the power-boosters a1*a2*a3….. *an =k.

 Bruce the miner works as a slave in a diamond mine, and now the mine is starting to fall apart. After helping his friends evacuate the mine, he thinks it is the perfect time to make some profit and escape from his oppressive masters.  His plan is to re-enter the mine with the excuse of helping more people, take as much diamonds as he can and exit the mine before it falls apart without being seen. Then, he will escape far away and live peacefully in a Caribbean island with all his diamonds. However, the mine will fall apart in L minutes, so he needs help in determining the maximum number of diamonds he can take and return to the entrance before the mine falls apart.  The mine is structured as N chambers connected by N-1 corridors. Each corridor connects two different chambers and takes a specific number of minutes to be traversed. Also, it is known that there is exactly one path between each pair of chambers in the mine. The chamber 0 represents the entrance to the mine. Miner Bruce can take as much diamonds as he wants from the chamber where he is instantly.  Input  The first line contains an integer T, which specifies the number of test cases. Then, T test case descriptions will follow.  Each test case will start with a line with two positive integers, N and L, whose meanings were described previously. The next line will contain N integers Di, specifying the number of diamonds on each chamber. The next N - 1 lines will contain three integers Ai, Bi and Ci each, which indicates that the chambers Ai and Bi are connected by a corridor that takes Ci minutes to be traversed.  Output  For each input case you must print the string "Case #i: ", where i is the test case number, starting from 1, followed by the maximum number that Bruce the miner can recover without being trapped inside the mine.   Example  Input 2 5 7 7 3 7 8 6 0 1 1 0 2 1 0 3 1 0 4 1 6 25 5 8 3 3 10 7 0 1 4 3 0 3 2 3 2 5 2 3 4 5 4  Output Case #1: 28 Case #2: 28   Constraints   1 ≤ T ≤100  2 ≤ N ≤100  1 ≤ L ≤200 Ci will be between 1 and 100, inclusive, for each i between 1 and N-1, inclusive.

Problem text... Mr. G. works as a tourist guide. His current assignment is to take some tourists from one city to another. Some two-way roads connect the cities. For each pair of neighboring cities there is a bus service that runs only between those two cities and uses the road that directly connects them. Each bus service has a limit on the maximum number of passengers it can carry. Mr. G. has a map showing the cities and the roads connecting them. He also has the information regarding each bus service. He understands that it may not always be possible for him to take all the tourists to the destination city in a single trip. But Mr. G. finds it difficult to find the best route himself so that he may be able to take all the tourists to the destination city in minimum number of trips. So, he seeks your help.  Input Input description... The input will contain one or more test cases. The first line of each test case will contain two positive integers N (11) is the limit on the maximum number of passengers to be carried by the bus between the two cities. City numbers are positive integers ranging from 1 to N. 2 5 1 4 7 3 6 30 15 60 20 30 20 10 35 25 40 the (R+1)th line will contain three integers S, D and T representing respectively the starting city, the destination city and the number of tourists to be guided. The input will end with two zeroes for N and R.  Output Output description... For each test case in the input output the minimum number of trips required on a separate line.  Example  Input: 7 10 1 2 30 1 3 15 1 4 10 2 4 25 2 5 60 3 4 40 3 6 20 4 7 35 5 7 20 6 7 30 1 7 99 3 2 1 2 15 2 3 10 1 3 30 0 0  Output: 4 3  
Problem text... Many persons are familiar with the Roman numerals for relatively small numbers. The symbols i, v, x, l and c represent the decimal values 1, 5, 10, 50 and 100 respectively. To represent other values, these symbols, and multiples where necessary, are concatenated, with the smaller valued symbols written further to the right. For example, the number 3 is represented as "iii", and the value 73 is represented as "lxxiii". The exceptions to this rule occur for numbers having units values of 4 to 9, and for tens values of 40 or 90. For these cases, the Roman numerals representations are "iv" (4), "ix" (9), "xl" (40) and "xc" (90). So the Roman numeral representations for 24,39,44,49 and 94 are xxiv, xxxix, xliv, xlix and xciv respectively. The preface of many books have pages numbered with Roman numerals, starting with "i" for the first page of the preface, and continuing in sequence. Assume books with pages having 100 or fewer pages of preface. How many i, v, x, l and c characters are required to number the pages in the preface? For example, in a five page preface we'll use the Roman numerals i, ii, iii, iv and v, meaning we need 7 i characters and 2 v characters.  Input Input description... The input will consists of a sequence of integers in the range 1 to 100, terminated by a zero. For each integer, excepts the final zero, determine the number of different types of characters needed to number the prefix pages with Roman numerals  Output Output description... For each integer in the input, write one line containing the five counts in the order i, v, x, l, c.  Example  Input: 2 20 99 0  Output: 3 0 0 0 0 28 10 14 0 0 140 50 150 50 10  
Problem text... A dancing square is a “transparent” n x n matrix whose components are "painted" with a uppercase x (x) or a period (.). A dancing square dances by spinning 90 clockwise or counterclockwise, and or flipping about a centered horizontal or vertical axis When dancing squares are dancing it can be quite challenging to determine which are identically painted and which are distinct. Write a program which inputs an original dancing square, then inputs one or more additional dancing squares and determines for each one if it is identical- i.e. can be obtained from original by some sequence of spin and/or flips, or is distinct- i.e. cannot be obtained from the original by sequence of spins and/or flips.  Input Input description... The first line of standard input contains the dimension n>=1 of all dancing squares which follow. The subsequent lines of input contain at least two dancing squares, each preceded by blank line and consisting of n lines containing n component characters.  Output Output description... For each dancing square in the standard input following the first one, output a line containing "identical" or "distinct", indicating whether it is identical to or distinct from the first one.  Example  Input: 3 x.x x.. xx. xxx ..x x.. xxx .. x x. x  Output: Square 2 is identical to square 1. Square 3 is distinct from square 1. 
 Multiplication of natural numbers in general is a cumbersome operation. In some cases however the product can be obtained by moving the last digit to the front.  Example: 179487 * 4 = 717948  Of course this property depends on the numbersystem you use, in the above example we used the decimal representation. In base 9 we have a shorter example:  17 * 4 = 71 (base 9)  as (9 + 7) * 4 = 7 * 9 +1  Input Input description... The input for your program is a textfile. Each line consists of three numbers separated by a space: the base of the number system, the least significant digit of the first factor, and the second factor. This second factor is one digit only hence less than the base. The input file ends with the standard end-of-file marker.  Output Output description... Your program determines for each input line the number of digits of the smallest first factor with the rotamultproperty. The output-file is also a textfile. Each line contains the answer for the corresponding input line.  Example  Input: 10 7 4 9 7 4 17 14 12  Output: 6 2 4  
You have been selected to write the navigation module for Bot. Unfortunately, the mechanical engineers have not provided a lot of flexibility in movement; indeed, the PropBot can only make two distinct movements. It can either move 10 cm forward, or turn towards the right by 45 degrees. Each of these individual movements takes one second of time.  Input  Your module has two inputs: the Cartesian coordinates of a point on the plane that the PropBot wants to get as close to as possible, and the maximum number of seconds that can be used to do this. At the beginning of the navigation, the robot is located at the origin, pointed in the +x direction. The number of seconds will be an integer between 0 and 24, inclusive. Both the x and y coordinates of the desired destination point will be a real number between -100 and 100, inclusive. The first entry in the input file will be the number of test cases, t (0 < t < 100). Following this line will be t lines, with each line containing three entries separated by spaces. The first entry will be the number of seconds PropBot has to get close to the point. The second entry is the x-coordinate of the point, and the third entry is the y-coordinate of the point.  Output Your program must return the distance between the goal point and the closest point the robot can get to within the given time. Your result should include at least one digit to the left of the decimal point, and exactly six digits to the right of the decimal point. To eliminate the chance of round off error affecting the results, we have constructed the test data so the seventh digit to the right of the decimal point of the true result is never a 4 or a 5.  Example  Input: 2 24 5.0 5.0 9 7.0 17.0   Output: 0.502525 0.100505 
For the purposes of this problem, we will assume that every page in an book is numbered sequentially, and that the first page is numbered 1. How many digits would you need to use to number the pages of a 10 page book? Pages 1 to 9 would require 1 digit each (total 9), and page 10 would require 2 digits. This makes 11 digits. Similarly, a book of 34 pages would require 59 digits. Can we work backwards? If you are told that a book requires 13 digits to number its pages, can you work out how many pages the book has? I hope so, because that is all you have to do for this problem. Each line in the input file represents the number of digits used in numbering a book. Your answer will be the number of pages the book has. If the number supplied cannot possibly be valid, your answer should be "Impossible!" Beware that books can be quite large, and the number of digits required for a given book can reach 2,000,000,000.    Input Each line in the input file contains a single integer, between 1 and 2,000,000,000, representing a number of digits used in numbering the pages of a book. A single # on a line indicates the end of input.   Output Output for each input number must be on a single line. If the input value is valid, output the number of pages in the book. Otherwise, output "Impossible!"   Example  Input: 11 13 59 60 1999999998 #   Output: 10 11 34 Impossible! 234567900   
--I just bought Leonardo's secret notebook! Rare object collector Stan Ucker was really agitated but his friend, special investigator Sarah Kepticwas unimpressed. --How do you know it is genuine? -- Oh, it must be, at that price. And it is written in the da Vinci code. Sarah browsed a few of the pages. It was obvious to her that the code was a substitution cipher, where each letter of the alphabet had been substituted by another letter. --Leonardo would have written the plain-text and left it to his assistant to encrypt, she said. And he must have supplied the substitution alphabet to be used. If we are lucky, we can find it on the back cover! She turned up the last page and, lo and behold, there was a single line of all 26 letters of the alphabet: QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJKLZXCVBNM -- This may be Leonardo's instructions meaning that each A in the plain-text was to be replaced by Q, each B withW, etcetera. Let us see... To their disappointment, they soon saw that this could not be the substitution that was used in the book. Suddenly, Stan brightened. -- Maybe Leonardo really wrote the substitution alphabet on the last page, and by mistake his assistant coded that line as he had coded the rest of the book. So the line we have here is the result of applying some permutation TWICE to the ordinary alphabet! Sarah took out her laptop computer and coded fiercely for a few minutes. Then she turned to Stan with a sympathetic expression. -- No, that couldn't be it. I am afraid that you have been duped again, my friend. In all probability, the book is a fake. Write a program that takes a permutation of the English alphabet as input and decides if it may be the result of performing some permutation twice.  Input The input begins with a positive number on a line of its own telling the number of test cases (at most 500). Then for each test case there is one line containing a permutation of the 26 capital letters of the English alphabet.   Output For each test case, output one line containing Yes if the given permutation can result from applying some permutation twice on the original alphabet string ABC...XYZ, otherwise output No.   Example  Input: 2 QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJKLZXCVBNM ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ  Output: No Yes  
  Given a string, identify the numbers and add those numbers and display the result    Input The first line contains a single integer T <= 40, the number of test cases. T test cases follow.

Output For each test case, output a single line containing the number of  alphabets that are repeated in the corresponding text.   Example Input: 3 aalmlc aPlmFl XcCnLb  Output: 2 1 1  
  Now a days it is possible to access particular website without typing it's full name. This helps in reducing the typing time. So in this you are given a website name as input and you have to cut short it's name and print the shoretd length of the website. The shortened version of the website name will be such that a user   won't have to type 'www.' to open a website anymore. You don't need to type vowels Though, you still need to type '.com' to open a website. Obviously, this means you can type the name of a website faster and save some time.     Input The first line contains T, the number of test cases. The second line contains the name of websites, as a string.  Output You have to print the ratio of characters you would have typed in shortest form to it's full form. Constraints: 1 <= T <= 100 1 <= Length of the website <= 200   Example Input: 2 www.google.com www.yahoo.com  Output: 7/14 6/13 
 For Turbo C++ Users : Read the following document before attempting the question :   Problem description.  The Skrulls are attacking our planet! The only way to stop them is to break into their weapons system and disable it. The password to disable the system is written on the machinery itself (in an encrypted form, obviously). Fortunately enough, you (Carol) know how to decrypt it:   You are given a list of 'N' integers. You need to select some elements from this list so that the product of the chosen numbers is biggest possible. At least 1 element has to be selected. Let this be 'X'. Now since 'X' may be too big, we want the remainder of X when it is divided by 1000000007 (ans % 1000000007).  Note about ‘modulo’:  The modulus operator (%) gives the remainder of division of 2 numbers. a % b = the remainder of division with a as ‘dividend’ and b as ‘divisor’. For eg. 5%3 = 2, since on dividing 5 by 3, we get 2 as remainder. Most languages support the % operator as the modulus operator. (to find modulus of x over y, just do z = x%y) Since we can’t really calculate the whole product and then take modulo, we take modulo on each step so as to keep the intermediate answer small by exploiting this property (a*b) % m = ((a%m)*(b%m))%m. To check overflow, you should use long data types instead of int data types (wherever reqd. and available).  If x<0 , x%m = (x+m)%m   Input First line contains 'T', the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains 'N', the number of elements in the original list. The next line contains 'N' elements of that list.  Output For each test case, print the required answer on a new line MODULO 1000000007.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 30 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6     Example Input: 1 4 -9 -11 771 23  Output: 1755567    Explanation We select all 4 numbers to yield the maximum product.

Format it like:  1 <= |S| <= 100000 1 <= Q <= 100  1 <= |T| <= 1000 All characters in the input are lowercase 'a'-'z'.     Example Input: aabcab 2 ac d  Output: 2 -1. 
 Ace has a team consisting of N players. He calls a subset of this team to be good if the subset has two or more players. He denotes all the good teams as S1 , S2 , S3 , ... , S2^N -N-1. Now he represents the GCD of the players of each good team Si as Gi. As you know Ace does not like to loose matches in COUNTER STRIKE and he can only win with the team having maximum Gi. Help Ace to find the maximum Gi .  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of players in the team. The second line contains N space-separated integersA1, A2, ..., AN denoting the players of the team.

Maximum gcd is 2 for the subset {2, 4} Example case 2. Maximum gcd is 12 for the subset {12, 36, 48}  
Shinchan is new to COUNTER STRIKE and he cannot differentiate between players of Terrorist and Counter Terrorist. Since he is new to COUNTER STRIKE so he used to kill his team members as he couldn't recognize them. Everyone got frustrated with him. One day he came up with a formula to recognize players by their user names.  This is his method: if the number of distinct characters in one's user name is odd, then he is a Counter Terrorist, otherwise he is a Terrorist. You are given the string that denotes the user name, please help Shinchan to recognize the players by his method.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Next T lines will contains a non-empty string, that contains only lowercase English letters(i.e. 'a' to 'z') — the user name.  Output  For each test case, output a single line containing "Terrorist" or "Counter Terrorist".     Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 400 1 ≤ length of user name ≤ 10^5     Example Input: 4 ace shars blizzard sak  Output: Counter Terrorist Terrorist Counter Terrorist Counter Terrorist    Explanation Example case 1. There are 3 different characters {a, c, e} which is Odd. Therefore, player is Counter Terrorist. Example case 2. There are 4 different characters {a, h, r, s} which is Even. Therefore, player is Terrorist. 
As you know in COUNTER STRIKE each player can belong to either Terrorist or Counter Terroritst. Let T denotes player belong to Terrorist and C denotes player belongs to Counter Terrorist. You are given a String S of length N-1, and it consists only of the letters C and T. You need to rearrange the numbers from 1 to N(including 1 and N) and save it an array X such that  if S[i] = T  -->  X[i] > X[i+1]    if S[i ] = C  --> X[i] < X[i+1] As there can be many such permutations, you need to print the lexicographically  largest permutation.  Input The only line of input contains a String S  Output The output contains N space separated integers(i.e. permutation of N numbers as described above).  Constraints 1 ≤ length of String ≤ 10^5    Example Input: CCCCCT  Output: 2 3 4 5 6 7 1    Explanation Example case 1. The lexicographically largest permutation that satisfies the given condition is: 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 
Finally Shinchan and Ace won all the matches of COUNTER STRIKE but they have forgotten to do their homework. Help them to finish their homework as it is already too late. You are given a weighted tree with W nodes. Nodes are numbered from 1 to W. For each node, you need to print the sum of distance of the nodes to all other nodes. Mathematically, for each node w, print the value of the expression Distance from node w to 1st node + Distance from node w to 2nd node +..... + Distance from node w to Wth node  Input Format The first line contains T, the number of test cases. For each test case, there are multiple lines. The first line contains W, the number of nodes in the tree. The next W−1 lines describe the tree; each line contains 3 integers X, Y, and Z, which denote that there is an edge from X to Y with weight Z.

Input First line of input contains t, the number of test cases. The next 't' lines contain n, the number that is given to Popeye by Olive. 0 0  Output Output would be a single number, that would be the number of values given to Popeye that can be expressed as a sum of two cubes.  Example  Input: 5 40 35 53 65 27  Output: 3 
Besides numbers Alice also likes to play with cubes of letters. She has infinite supply of the cubes with every lowercase Latin letter written on it. So she often builds the towers from her cubes. Specifically, there are N initially empty towers of cubes. Step-by-step, Alice picks a cube and puts it to the top of some of the towers. Sometimes she becomes curious about how many towers contain some of her M favorite words (not necessarily real English words). Alice considers that a tower contains a word in case this word can be read on some consecutive "subtower" of this tower in up-down direction. For example, if Alice puts cubes with letters a, b, c, d (in this order) to the top of the tower, then the tower contains words cba or dc and doesn't contain words abcd, e. But now the towers has grown very large, so Alice asks you to help her. There will be three types of queries given to you:  0 X C: put the cube with letter C to the top of the X^th tower. 1 L R P: find the number of towers in the range [L, R] which contain the P^th favorite word. 2 L R P: find the number of ways to pick a tower in the range [L; R] and then to read an occurrence of the P^th favorite word at this tower. Two ways are considered different, if the tower or if the topmost cube position of the occurrence are different.  Please help Alice.  Input The first line of the input contains three space-separated integers N, M and Q denoting the number of towers, the number of Alice's favorite words and the number of queries respectively. Each of the following M lines contains a lowercase Latin letters string wi, denoting the i^th favorite word of Alice. Each of the following Q lines contains a query in one of the formats described above.  Output For each query of the type 1 or 2, output the answer on the separate line.  Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ Q ≤ 2 × 10^5 1 ≤ X ≤ N 1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ N 1 ≤ P ≤ M ≤ 65536 1 ≤ sum of |wi| ≤ 65536 All wi's are different. C is a lowercase Latin letter wi contains only lowercase Latin letters There will be no more than 65536 queries of the type 0.   Example Input: 3 2 10 a ab 0 1 a 1 1 2 1 0 2 a 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 2 0 1 a 2 1 3 1 0 1 b 1 1 2 2 2 2 3 1  Output: 1 2 0 3 0 1  Explanation  In the second query the only tower containing the word a is the tower 1 In the fourth query the towers containing the word a are towers 1 and 2 In the fifth query there is no even a single tower containing the word ab In the seventh query there are two ways to read the word a at the tower 1 (starting at the topmost or at the bottommost cube), one way to read the word a at the tower 2 (since this tower consists only of one cube with letter a) and zero ways to read the word a at the tower 3 (since it's empty) In the ninth query there is no way to read the word ab from any tower. Please pay attention that if we try to read a two-letter word from the top of the first tower, we will get ba and not ab In the tenth query the only tower containing the word a is the tower 2, and since it consists only of one cube with letter a, there is surely only one way to read this word  
The EEE classroom is quite an explosive class. The explosiveness depends on the type and number of students present in the class. Specifically, the explosiveness doubles every time a new person enters the class and finds at least one member of his gang already present in the class.  Given the details of the class gangs, print the minimum possible explosiveness of the class mod 1000000007.   Input The first line of the input contains two integers, N the number of students present in the class and M . The next M lines contain 2 integers A and B such that student number (A and student number B belong to the same gang.  Output Print the minimum possible explosiveness of the class mod 1000000007 by optimizing the entry sequence of the students. The initial explosiveness of the class is  1 . Only one student enters the class at a time and all the n students must attend the class (Attendance shortage is a big issue here).  Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 1000000 0 ≤ M ≤ (N*(N-1))/2 1 ≤ A, B ≤ N   Example Input: 5 3 1 2 2 3 5 4 Output: 8  Explanation Example case 1.  Let the entry sequence be 5 1 2 3 4. When 5 enters the class, the explosiveness doesn't change. Same is the case with 1 as no member of his gang is present. 2 enters and finds 1 so the explosiveness doubles to 1*2 = 2. 3 doubles it again to 2*2 = 4. Finally 4 enters and finds 5 so the explosiveness doubles again to 2*4 = 8. Therefore the answer is 8 % 1000000007 = 8.

Here is another mathematical problem, where the trick is as much to discover the algorithm as it is to write the code: write a program to display all possible permutations of a given input string--if the string contains duplicate characters, you may have multiple repeated results.   Input Input should be of the form  Permute  string   Output Output should be a word per line.   Example  Input:  cat  Output:  cat cta act atc tac tca   
Here's a challenge that's a bit more mathematical in nature. Write a program that determines the number of trailing zeros at the end of X! (X factorial), where X is an arbitrary number. For instance, 5! is 120, so it has one trailing zero. (How can you handle extremely values, such as 100!?)    Example  Input:  An integer e.g 5!  Output:  No of trailing zeros in answer, 5! Is 120 so it has one trailing zero  
Earlier days, in BUEST, salary to teachers is given in the form of special coins named as BUEST coins. Any teacher could exchange it with the bank into three coins n/,n/3/n/4. But since in the world, it will be very difficult with those decimals to purchase things so simply bank rounds off the values. As the institute has foreign collaboration with universities, so in a faculty exchange program if a teacher goes to Japan, then he could exchange BUEST cons with Yen. Suppose you have one BUEST coin. What is the maximum amount of yen can get to survive in Japan.   Input The input will contain several test cases. Each test case is a single line with a number n. it is is the number written on your coin   Output For each test case output the singles line, containing the maximum amount of Japanese Yen a teacher can make.   Example  Input:  12 2  Output:  13 2

While Tom Cruise(Cage) fighting in the movie "Edge of Tomorrow", he finds himself in a modern lab, where he needs to kill the brain of a mutant species Omega. The DNA of the Omega is made up of characters of A, T, G and C like ours. He has certain enzymes which will cut and remove certain parts of this DNA. The mutant being an intelligent species, is able to reform its DNA, even after a piece of DNA is removed.  You will be given a DNA sequence, and few enzymes. Suppose, a DNA sequence goes like this : ATGCTGCTATGCATGCAGTGACT, and you are given enzymes which can remove AT and GC sequences. Thereby, you need to remove all occurrences of AT from the DNA first and then reform the DNA and apply the next enzyme to remove all occurrences of GC. The output of the problem would be the string you get at last reforming the pieces which are not removed by these enzymes. Input The first line of input consists of an integer n that denotes the number of enzymes. The second line has the DNA sequence. The next n lines has the input B1, B2, B3... Bn. Output For given input DNA sequence, output a single line containing the final reformed DNA that is formed by repeatedly removing all the occurrences of B1, B2, B3... Bn from A. In case the DNA is completely consumed print 0 to indicate that there is no DNA left.  Constraints  1 <= n <= 10  Example  Input: 2 ATACGCATGACGATGCATGCAGCAT ATA GC   Output: CATGACGATATAAT  Input: 3 ATGCATGCATCGACTCAGCATCAGCATCGACTA TG GC AT  Output: ACACCGACTCACACGACTA 
  Reeti has just started learning how to code. As is the case with many programmers, one begins understanding algorithms with the help of pseudocode. Reeti has just started looking at some basic algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Binary Search etc. However, being a person with AOCD (Algorithmic Obsessive Compulsive Disorder), she does not rest until she has rigorously analysed the algorithm she is learning.   Now, she is looking at an algorithm to find the minimum element in an array. This is the pseudocode she is dealing with : 1.   int N; 2.   input N 3.   int arr[1:N]; 4.   for i=1...N: 5.       input arr[i] 6.   int min = INFINITY; 7.   for i=1...N: 8.       if(arr[i]<min) 9.           min = arr[i];   Reeti has just completed a course on Probability and Statistics, and being curious she decides to analyse the algorithm from a probabilistic point of view. She decides to ensure that the array arr is a randomly picked from the set of permutations of numbers 1,N. Her question is, what is the expected value of the number of reassignments to variable min i.e the number of times line 9 is executed.  Input  The first line of input is the number of test cases T.  The next T lines consist of a single integer N, i.e the size of the array for that test case.  Output  For each test case, print the expected value of the number of reassignments to min, with exactly 3 digits after the decimal point(rounded).  i.e Even if the answer is a whole number, print it as 5.000 Example  Input:  2 1 3    Output: 1.000 1.833   Explanation Example case 1. In the first test case, there is only 1 possible array. And we get one reassignment. So expected value is 1/1 = 1.  In the second test case, there are 6 possible arrays. In sorted order of arrays (descending), number of reassignments are 3,2,2,2,1,1. So expected value = 11/6 = 1.833 (3 decimal places)
