Akhil has many balls of white and black colors. One day, he was playing with them. During the play, he arranged the balls into two rows both consisting of N number of balls. These two rows of balls are given to you in the form of strings X, Y. Both these string consist of 'W' and 'B', where 'W' denotes a white colored ball and 'B' a black colored.  Other than these two rows of balls, Akhil has an infinite supply of extra balls of each color. he wants to create another row of N balls, Z in such a way that the sum of hamming distance between X and Z, and hamming distance between Y and Z is maximized. Hamming Distance between two strings X and Y is defined as the number of positions where the color of balls in row X differs from the row Y ball at that position. e.g. hamming distance between "WBB", "BWB" is 2, as at position 1 and 2, corresponding colors in the two strings differ..  As there can be multiple such arrangements of row Z, Akhil wants you to find the lexicographically smallest arrangement which will maximize the above value.   Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows: First line of each test case will contain a string X denoting the arrangement of balls in first row Second line will contain the string Y denoting the arrangement of balls in second row.   Output  For each test case, output a single line containing the string of length N denoting the arrangement of colors of the balls belonging to row Z.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 3   Example Input: 1 WBWB WBBB  Output: BWBW   Explanation Example case 1. As we know, Hamming Distance(WBWB, BWBW) + Hamming Distance(WBBB, BWBW) = 4 + 3 = 7. You can try any other value for string Z, it will never exceed 6. 
 There's an array A consisting of N non-zero integers A1..N. A subarray of A is called alternating if any two adjacent elements in it have different signs (i.e. one of them should be negative and the other should be positive).  For each x from 1 to N, compute the length of the longest alternating subarray that starts at x - that is, a subarray Ax..y for the maximum possible y ≥ x. The length of such a subarray is y-x+1.   Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T - the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains N. The following line contains N space-separated integers A1..N.   Output For each test case, output one line with N space-separated integers - the lengths of the longest alternating subarray starting at x, for each x from 1 to N.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 -10^9 ≤ Ai ≤ 10^9   Example Input: 3 4 1 2 3 4 4 1 -5 1 -5 6 -5 -1 -1 2 -2 -3  Output: 1 1 1 1 4 3 2 1 1 1 3 2 1 1  Explanation Example case 1. No two elements have different signs, so any alternating subarray may only consist of a single number. Example case 2. Every subarray is alternating. Example case 3. The only alternating subarray of length 3 is A3..5. 
Kattapa, as you all know was one of the greatest warriors of his time. The kingdom of Maahishmati had never lost a battle under him (as army-chief), and the reason for that was their really powerful army, also called as Mahasena. Kattapa was known to be a very superstitious person. He believed that a soldier is "lucky" if the soldier is holding an even number of weapons, and "unlucky" otherwise. He considered the army as "READY FOR BATTLE" if the count of "lucky" soldiers is strictly greater than the count of "unlucky" soldiers, and "NOT READY" otherwise. Given the number of weapons each soldier is holding, your task is to determine whether the army formed by all these soldiers is "READY FOR BATTLE" or "NOT READY". Note: You can find the definition of an even number here.  Input  The first line of input consists of a single integer N denoting the number of soldiers. The second line of input consists of N space separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN, where Ai denotes the number of weapons that the i^th soldier is holding.  Output Generate one line output saying "READY FOR BATTLE", if the army satisfies the conditions that Kattapa requires or "NOT READY" otherwise (quotes for clarity).  Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 100 1 ≤ Ai ≤ 100   Example 1 Input: 1 1  Output: NOT READY  Example 2 Input: 1 2  Output: READY FOR BATTLE  Example 3 Input: 4 11 12 13 14  Output: NOT READY  Example 4 Input: 3 2 3 4  Output: READY FOR BATTLE  Example 5 Input: 5 1 2 3 4 5  Output: NOT READY  Explanation   Example 1: For the first example, N = 1 and the array A = [1]. There is only 1 soldier and he is holding 1 weapon, which is odd. The number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons = 0, and number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons = 1. Hence, the answer is "NOT READY" since the number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons is not greater than the number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons. Example 2: For the second example, N = 1 and the array A = [2]. There is only 1 soldier and he is holding 2 weapons, which is even. The number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons = 1, and number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons = 0. Hence, the answer is "READY FOR BATTLE" since the number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons is greater than the number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons. Example 3: For the third example, N = 4 and the array A = [11, 12, 13, 14]. The 1^st soldier is holding 11 weapons (which is odd), the 2^nd soldier is holding 12 weapons (which is even), the 3^rd soldier is holding 13 weapons (which is odd), and the 4^th soldier is holding 14 weapons (which is even). The number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons = 2, and number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons = 2. Notice that we have an equal number of people holding even number of weapons and odd number of weapons. The answer here is "NOT READY" since the number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons is not strictly greater than the number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons. Example 4: For the fourth example, N = 3 and the array A = [2, 3, 4]. The 1^st soldier is holding 2 weapons (which is even), the 2^nd soldier is holding 3 weapons (which is odd), and the 3^rd soldier is holding 4 weapons (which is even). The number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons = 2, and number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons = 1. Hence, the answer is "READY FOR BATTLE" since the number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons is greater than the number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons. Example 5: For the fifth example, N = 5 and the array A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The 1^st soldier is holding 1 weapon (which is odd), the 2^nd soldier is holding 2 weapons (which is even), the 3^rd soldier is holding 3 weapons (which is odd), the 4^th soldier is holding 4 weapons (which is even), and the 5^th soldier is holding 5 weapons (which is odd). The number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons = 2, and number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons = 3. Hence, the answer is "NOT READY" since the number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons is not greater than the number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons.  
 	A valid parentheses sequence is a non-empty string where each character is either '(' or ')', which satisfies the following constraint:   You can find a way to repeat erasing adjacent pairs of parentheses '()' until it becomes empty.   	For example, '(())' and '()((()()))' are valid parentheses sequences, but ')()(' and '(()' are not.   	Mike has a valid parentheses sequence. He really likes everything about his sequence, except the fact that it is quite long. So Mike has recently decided that he will replace his parentheses sequence with a new one in the near future. But not every valid parentheses sequence will satisfy him. To help you understand his requirements we'll introduce the pseudocode of function F(S):   	FUNCTION F( S - a valid parentheses sequence ) 	BEGIN 		balance = 0 		max_balance = 0 		FOR index FROM 1 TO LENGTH(S) 		BEGIN 			if S[index] == '(' then balance = balance + 1 			if S[index] == ')' then balance = balance - 1 			max_balance = max( max_balance, balance ) 		END 		RETURN max_balance 	END  	In other words, F(S) is equal to the maximal balance over all prefixes of S.   	Let's denote A as Mike's current parentheses sequence, and B as a candidate for a new one. Mike is willing to replace A with B if F(A) is equal to F(B). He would also like to choose B with the minimal possible length amongst ones satisfying the previous condition. If there are several such strings with the minimal possible length, then Mike will choose the least one lexicographically, considering '(' to be less than ')'.   	Help Mike!   Input  	The first line of the input contains one integer T denoting the number of testcases to process.   	The only line of each testcase contains one string A denoting Mike's parentheses sequence. It is guaranteed that A only consists of the characters '(' and ')'. It is also guaranteed that A is a valid parentheses sequence.   Output  	The output should contain exactly T lines, one line per each testcase in the order of their appearance. The only line of each testcase should contain one string B denoting the valid parentheses sequence that should be chosen by Mike to replace A.   Constraints 1 ≤ T ≤ 5; 1 ≤ |A| ≤ 100000(10^5).  Example Input: 1 ()((()()))  Output: ((()))  
 Chef likes problems involving arrays. Unfortunately, the last one he tried to solve didn't quite get solved.   Chef has an array A of N positive numbers. He wants to find the number of subarrays for which the sum and product of elements are equal.   Please help Chef find this number.   Input The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The first line of each test contains the integer N. The next line contains N integers — A1, A2, ..., AN — denoting the array.  Output For each test case, output a single line with the answer for the instance.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 50 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 1 ≤ Ai ≤ 10^9^ A1 * A2 * ... * An ≤ 10^9^   Example  Input: 3 3 1 3 2 4 4 1 2 1 6 1 2 2 2 2 1  Output: 4 5 9  Explanation:  Example case 1. There are 4 such subarrays: A[1..1], A[2..2], A[3..3], A[1..3]. Consider A[1..3], sum = 1 + 3 + 2 = 6, product = 1 * 3 * 2 = 6.  
  Chef has a sequence of N numbers. He like a sequence better if the sequence contains his favorite sequence as a substring.   Given the sequence and his favorite sequence(F) check whether the favorite sequence is contained in the sequence  Input  The first line will contain the number of test cases and are followed by the cases. Each test case consists of four lines: The length of the sequence, the sequence N,the length of F and the sequence F   Output  Print "Yes" if the sequence contains the favourite sequence int it otherwise print "No"   Constraints  1<=T<=10 1 1  Input: 2 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 3 2 3 4 6 22 5 6 33 1 4 2 4 15  Output: Yes No 
Chef has found two very old sheets of paper, each of which originally contained a string of lowercase Latin letters. The strings on both the sheets have equal lengths. However, since the sheets are very old, some letters have become unreadable. Chef would like to estimate the difference between these strings. Let's assume that the first string is named S1, and the second S2. The unreadable symbols are specified with the question mark symbol '?'. The difference between the strings equals to the number of positions i, such that S1i is not equal to S2i, where S1i and S2i denote the symbol at the i the position in S1 and S2, respectively. Chef would like to know the minimal and the maximal difference between the two strings, if he changes all unreadable symbols to lowercase Latin letters. Now that you're fully aware of Chef's programming expertise, you might have guessed that he needs you help solving this problem as well. Go on, help him!  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of a test case contains a string S1. The second line of a test case contains a string S2. Both strings consist of lowercase Latin letters and question marks in places where the symbols are unreadable.  Output For each test case, output the minimal and the maximal difference between two given strings separated with a single space.  Constraints   1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ |S1|, |S2| ≤ 100 Example Input: 3 a?c ??b ???a ???a ?abac aba?w  Output: 1 3 0 3 3 5  Explanation Example case 1. You can change the question marks in the strings so that you obtain S1 = abc and S2 = abb. Then S1 and S2 will differ in one position. On the other hand, you can change the letters so that S1 = abc and S2 = bab. Then, the strings will differ in all three positions. Example case 2. Change the question marks this way: S1 = dcba, S2 = dcba, then the strings will differ in 0 positions. You can also change the question marks so that S1 = aaaa, S2 = dcba, then the strings will differ in 3 positions. Example case 3. Change the question marks this way: S1 = aabac, S2 = abaaw, then the strings will differ in 3 positions. Then, change the question marks this way: S1 = xabac, S2 = abayw, then they will differ in 5 positions. 
Little Malvika is very peculiar about colors. On her birthday, her mom wanted to buy balloons for decorating the house. So she asked her about her color preferences. The sophisticated little person that Malvika is, she likes only two colors — amber and brass. Her mom bought n balloons, each of which was either amber or brass in color. You are provided this information in a string s consisting of characters 'a' and 'b' only, where 'a' denotes that the balloon is amber, where 'b' denotes it being brass colored.   When Malvika saw the balloons, she was furious with anger as she wanted all the balloons of the same color. In her anger, she painted some of the balloons with the opposite color (i.e., she painted some amber ones brass and vice versa) to make all balloons appear to be the same color. As she was very angry, it took her a lot of time to do this, but you can probably show her the right way of doing so, thereby teaching her a lesson to remain calm in difficult situations, by finding out the minimum number of balloons needed to be painted in order to make all of them the same color.   Input  The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The first and only line of each test case contains a string s.   Output  For each test case, output a single line containing an integer — the minimum number of flips required.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, where n denotes to the length of the string s.   Example Input: 3 ab bb baaba  Output: 1 0 2  Explanation In the first example, you can change amber to brass or brass to amber. In both the cases, both the balloons will have same colors. So, you will need to paint 1 balloon. So the answer is 1.  In the second example, As the color of all the balloons is already the same, you don't need to paint any of them. So, the answer is 0.  
Chef has just started Programming, he is in first year of Engineering. Chef is reading about Relational Operators. Relational Operators are operators which check relatioship between two values. Given two numerical values A and B you need to help chef in finding the relationship between them that is, First one is greater than second or, First one is less than second or, First and second one are equal.    Input First line contains an integer T, which denotes the number of testcases.

After visiting a childhood friend, Chef wants to get back to his home. Friend lives at the first street, and Chef himself lives at the N-th (and the last) street. Their city is a bit special: you can move from the X-th street to the Y-th street if and only if 1 <= Y - X <= K, where K is the integer value that is given to you. Chef wants to get to home in such a way that the product of all the visited streets' special numbers is minimal (including the first and the N-th street). Please, help him to find such a product.  Input The first line of input consists of two integer numbers - N and K - the number of streets and the value of K respectively. The second line consist of N numbers  - A1, A2, ..., AN respectively, where Ai equals to the special number of the i-th street.  Output Please output the value of the minimal possible product, modulo 1000000007.  Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ Ai ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ K ≤ N   Example Input: 4 2 1 2 3 4.

 Tomya is a girl. She loves Chef Ciel very much.   Tomya like a positive integer p, and now she wants to get a receipt of Ciel's restaurant whose total price is exactly p. The current menus of Ciel's restaurant are shown the following table.   Name of Menuprice eel flavored water1 deep-fried eel bones2 clear soup made with eel livers4 grilled eel livers served with grated radish8 savory egg custard with eel16 eel fried rice (S)32 eel fried rice (L)64 grilled eel wrapped in cooked egg128 eel curry rice256 grilled eel over rice512 deluxe grilled eel over rice1024 eel full-course2048   Note that the i-th menu has the price 2^i-1 (1 ≤ i ≤ 12).   Since Tomya is a pretty girl, she cannot eat a lot. So please find the minimum number of menus whose total price is exactly p. Note that if she orders the same menu twice, then it is considered as two menus are ordered. (See Explanations for details)   Input  The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains an integer p.   Output  For each test case, print the minimum number of menus whose total price is exactly p.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 5 1 ≤ p ≤ 100000 (10^5) There exists combinations of menus whose total price is exactly p.   Sample Input 4 10 256 255 4096  Sample Output 2 1 8 2  Explanations  In the first sample, examples of the menus whose total price is 10 are the following: 1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1 = 10 (10 menus) 1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+2 = 10 (9 menus) 2+2+2+2+2 = 10 (5 menus) 2+4+4 = 10 (3 menus) 2+8 = 10 (2 menus) Here the minimum number of menus is 2.   In the last sample, the optimal way is 2048+2048=4096 (2 menus). Note that there is no menu whose price is 4096. 
After a long time, Chef has finally decided to renovate his house. Chef's house has N rooms in it numbered from 1 to N. Each room is currently painted in one of the red, blue or green colors. Your are given configuration of colors of his house by a string S consisting of N characters. In this string, color red will be denoted by 'R', green by 'G' and blue by 'B'.   Chef does not like current painting configuration that much and would like to repaint the house such that each room has same color. For painting, Chef has all the 3 color paints available and mixing any 2 color paints will result into 3rd color paint i.e  R + B = G B + G = R G + R = B   For example, painting a room having red color before with green color paint will make the color of room blue.   Also, Chef has many buckets of paint of each color. Simply put, you can assume that he will not run out of paint.  Being extraordinary lazy, our little chef does not want to work much and therefore, he has asked you to find the minimum number of rooms he has to repaint (possibly zero) in order to have all the rooms with same color. Can you please help him?  Input First line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. First line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the number of rooms in the chef's house. Next line of each test case contains a string S denoting the current color configuration of rooms.  Output For each test case, Print the minimum number of rooms need to be painted in order to have all the rooms painted with same color i.e either red, blue or green.  Constraints   1 ≤ T ≤ 10   1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5   Si = {'R','G','B'}    Scoring  Example Input  3 3 RGR 3 RRR 3 RGB  Output  1 0 2  Explanation:  Test 1: Chef prefers to paint room 2 with blue color such that the resulting color will be red and all the rooms have same color i.e red. Test 2: Given configuration has all the rooms painted with red color and therefore, chef does not need to do painting work at all. Test 3: One possible way of renovation is to paint room 1 with green color, room 2 with red color such that all rooms have same color i.e blue.  
 The Chef likes to stay in touch with his staff. So, the Chef, the head server, and the sous-chef all carry two-way transceivers so they can stay in constant contact. Of course, these transceivers have a limited range so if two are too far apart, they cannot communicate directly.   The Chef invested in top-of-the-line transceivers which have a few advanced features. One is that even if two people cannot talk directly because they are out of range, if there is another transceiver that is close enough to both, then the two transceivers can still communicate with each other using the third transceiver as an intermediate device.   There has been a minor emergency in the Chef's restaurant and he needs to communicate with both the head server and the sous-chef right away. Help the Chef determine if it is possible for all three people to communicate with each other, even if two must communicate through the third because they are too far apart.   Input  The first line contains a single positive integer T ≤ 100 indicating the number of test cases to follow. The first line of each test case contains a positive integer R ≤ 1,000 indicating that two transceivers can communicate directly without an intermediate transceiver if they are at most R meters away from each other. The remaining three lines of the test case describe the current locations of the Chef, the head server, and the sous-chef, respectively. Each such line contains two integers X,Y (at most 10,000 in absolute value) indicating that the respective person is located at position X,Y.   Output  For each test case you are to output a single line containing a single string. If it is possible for all three to communicate then you should output "yes". Otherwise, you should output "no".   To be clear, we say that two transceivers are close enough to communicate directly if the length of the straight line connecting their X,Y coordinates is at most R.   Example  Input: 3 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 2 0 1 0 0 1 0 2 0 0 0 2 2 1   Output: yes yes no  
Chef is on a vacation these days, so his friend Chefza is trying to solve Chef's everyday tasks. Today's task is to make a sweet roll. Rolls are made by a newly invented cooking machine. The machine is pretty universal - it can make lots of dishes and Chefza is thrilled about this. To make a roll, Chefza has to set all the settings to specified integer values. There are lots of settings, each of them set to some initial value. The machine is pretty complex and there is a lot of cooking to be done today, so Chefza has decided to use only two quick ways to change the settings. In a unit of time, he can pick one setting (let's say its current value is v) and change it in one of the following ways.  If v is even, change this setting to v/2. If v is odd, change it to (v − 1)/2. Change setting to 2 × v  The receipt is given as a list of integer values the settings should be set to. It is guaranteed that each destination setting can be represented as an integer power of 2. Since Chefza has just changed his profession, he has a lot of other things to do. Please help him find the minimum number of operations needed to set up a particular setting of the machine. You can prove that it can be done in finite time.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains two integers A and B denoting the initial and desired values of the setting, respectively.  Output For each test case, output a single line containing minimum number of operations Chefza has to perform in order to set up the machine.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 200 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^7 1 ≤ B ≤ 10^7, and B is an integer power of 2   Example Input: 6 1 1 2 4 3 8 4 16 4 1 1 4  Output: 0 1 4 2 2 2  Explanation  In the first test case, you don't need to do anything. In the second test case, you need to multiply 2 by 2 and get 4. This is done in 1 operation. In the third test case, you need to obtain 1 from 3 and then multiply it by 2 three times to obtain 8. A total of 4 operations. In the fourth test case, multiply 4 by 2 twice. In the fifth test case, divide 4 by 2 twice. In the sixth test case, multiply 1 by 2 twice.  
There are 100 houses located on a straight line. The first house is numbered 1 and the last one is numbered 100. Some M houses out of these 100 are occupied by cops. Thief Devu has just stolen PeePee's bag and is looking for a house to hide in. PeePee uses fast 4G Internet and sends the message to all the cops that a thief named Devu has just stolen her bag and ran into some house. Devu knows that the cops run at a maximum speed of x houses per minute in a straight line and they will search for a maximum of y minutes. Devu wants to know how many houses are safe for him to escape from the cops. Help him in getting this information.  Input First line contains T, the number of test cases to follow. First line of each test case contains 3 space separated integers: M, x and y. For each test case, the second line contains M space separated integers which represent the house numbers where the cops are residing.  Output For each test case, output a single line containing the number of houses which are safe to hide from cops.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4 1 ≤ x, y, M ≤ 10   Example Input: 3 4 7 8 12 52 56 8 2 10 2 21 75 2 5 8 10 51  Output: 0 18 9  Explanation Example 1 : Cops in house 12 can cover houses 1 to 68, and cops in house 52 can cover the rest of the houses. So, there is no safe house. Example 2 : Cops in house 21 can cover houses 1 to 41, and cops in house 75 can cover houses 55 to 95, leaving houses numbered 42 to 54, and 96 to 100 safe. So, in total 18 houses are safe. 
 Grapes of Coderpur are very famous. Devu went to the market and saw that there were N people selling grapes. He didn’t like it because things were not very structured. So, he gave a task to Dhinwa to make things better. If Dhinwa successfully completes the task, Devu will be happy.   Devu wants to change the number of grapes in a bucket of zero or more sellers in such a way that the GCD  of all the number of grapes is divisible by K. Dhinwa can add or remove any number of grapes from each of the buckets. Adding or removing a grape will be counted as an operation. Also after the operation, none of the seller’s bucket should be empty.   Help Dhinwa in finding the minimum number of operations needed to make Devu happy.   Input  First line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. For each test case, first line will contain an integer N denoting the number of buckets and integer K.  Next line contains N space separated integers denoting the number of grapes in each of the bucket.   Output For each test case, print a single integer representing the answer of that test case.  Constraints  Example Input: 2 2 2 3 5 3 7 10 16 18  Output: 2 8   Explanation  For the first test case, add or remove 1 grape in each of the bucket.   For the second test case, remove three grapes in the first bucket, remove two grapes from the second bucket and add three grapes in the third bucket.  
The faculty of application management and consulting services (FAMCS) of the Berland State University (BSU) has always been popular among Berland's enrollees. This year, N students attended the entrance exams, but no more than K will enter the university. In order to decide who are these students, there are series of entrance exams. All the students with score strictly greater than at least (N-K) students' total score gets enrolled. In total there are E entrance exams, in each of them one can score between 0 and M points, inclusively. The first E-1 exams had already been conducted, and now it's time for the last tribulation. Sergey is the student who wants very hard to enter the university, so he had collected the information about the first E-1 from all N-1 enrollees (i.e., everyone except him). Of course, he knows his own scores as well. In order to estimate his chances to enter the University after the last exam, Sergey went to a fortune teller. From the visit, he learnt about scores that everyone except him will get at the last exam. Now he wants to calculate the minimum score he needs to score in order to enter to the university. But now he's still very busy with minimizing the amount of change he gets in the shops, so he asks you to help him.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains four space separated integers N, K, E, M denoting the number of students, the maximal number of students who'll get enrolled, the total number of entrance exams and maximal number of points for a single exam, respectively. The following N-1 lines will contain E integers each, where the first E-1 integers correspond to the scores of the exams conducted. The last integer corresponds to the score at the last exam, that was predicted by the fortune-teller. The last line contains E-1 integers denoting Sergey's score for the first E-1 exams.  Output  For each test case, output a single line containing the minimum score Sergey should get in the last exam in order to be enrolled. If Sergey doesn't have a chance to be enrolled, output "Impossible" (without quotes).   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 5 1 ≤ K < N ≤ 10^4 1 ≤ M ≤ 10^9 1 ≤ E ≤ 4   Example Input: 1 4 2 3 10 7 7 7 4 6 10 7 10 9 9 9  Output: 4  Explanation Example case 1. If Sergey gets 4 points at the last exam, his score will be equal to 9+9+4=22. This will be the second score among all the enrollees - the first one will get 21, the second one will get 20 and the third will have the total of 26. Thus, Sergey will enter the university. 
 The most important part of a GSM network is so called Base Transceiver Station (BTS). These transceivers form the areas called cells (this term gave the name to the cellular phone) and every phone connects to the BTS with the strongest signal (in a little simplified view). Of course, BTSes need some attention and technicians need to check their function periodically.  The technicians faced a very interesting problem recently. Given a set of BTSes to visit, they needed to find the shortest path to visit all of the given points and return back to the central company building. Programmers have spent several months studying this problem but with no results. They were unable to find the solution fast enough. After a long time, one of the programmers found this problem in a conference article. Unfortunately, he found that the problem is so called "Traveling Salesman Problem" and it is very hard to solve. If we have N BTSes to be visited, we can visit them in any order, giving us N! possibilities to examine. The function expressing that number is called factorial and can be computed as a product  1.2.3.4....N. The number is very high even for a relatively small N. The programmers understood they had no chance to solve the problem. But because they have already received the research grant from the government, they needed to continue with their studies and produce at least some results. So they started to study behavior of the factorial function. For example, they defined the function Z. For any positive integer N, Z(N) is the number of zeros at the end of the decimal form of number N!. They noticed that this function never decreases. If we have two numbers N1<N2, then  Z(N1) <= Z(N2). It is because we can never "lose" any trailing zero by multiplying by any positive number. We can only get new and new zeros. The function Z is very interesting, so we need a computer program that can determine its value efficiently.  Input There is a single positive integer T on the first line of input (equal to about 100000). It stands for the number of numbers to follow. Then there are T lines, each containing exactly one positive integer number N, 1 <= N <= 1000000000.  Output For every number N, output a single line containing the single non-negative integer Z(N).  Example Sample Input:  6 3 60 100 1024 23456 8735373  Sample Output:  0 14 24 253 5861 2183837

  Forgotten languages (also known as extinct languages) are languages that are no longer in use. Such languages were, probably, widely used before and no one could have ever imagined that they will become extinct at some point. Unfortunately, that is what happened to them. On the happy side of things, a language may be dead, but some of its words may continue to be used in other languages.   Using something called as the Internet, you have acquired a dictionary of N words of a forgotten language. Meanwhile, you also know K phrases used in modern languages. For each of the words of the forgotten language, your task is to determine whether the word is still in use in any of these K modern phrases or not.   Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.   The first line of a test case description contains two space separated positive integers N and K.   The second line of the description contains N strings denoting a dictionary of the forgotten language.   Each of the next K lines of the description starts with one positive integer L denoting the number of words in the corresponding phrase in modern languages. The integer is followed by L strings (not necessarily distinct) denoting the phrase.   Output For each test case, output a single line containing N tokens (space-separated): if the i^th word of the dictionary exists in at least one phrase in modern languages, then you should output YES as the i^th token, otherwise NO.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 20 1 ≤ N ≤ 100 1 ≤ K, L ≤ 50 1 ≤ length of any string in the input ≤ 5   Example Input: 2 3 2 piygu ezyfo rzotm 1 piygu 6 tefwz tefwz piygu ezyfo tefwz piygu 4 1 kssdy tjzhy ljzym kegqz 4 kegqz kegqz kegqz vxvyj  Output: YES YES NO NO NO NO YES  
Today is Chef's birthday. His mom has surprised him with truly fruity gifts: 2 fruit baskets. The first basket contains N apples, and the second one contains M oranges. Chef likes apples and oranges very much but he likes them equally, and therefore, wants to have the minimum possible difference between the number of apples and oranges he has. To do so, he can purchase 1 apple or 1 orange by paying exactly 1 gold coin (that's some expensive fruit, eh?). Chef can purchase fruits at most K times (as he has only K gold coins in his pocket) to make the difference the minimum possible. Our little Chef is busy in celebrating his birthday to the fullest, and therefore, he has handed this job to his best friend — you. Can you help him by finding the minimum possible difference he can achieve between the number of apples and orange he owns?  Input The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The first and only line of each test case contains 3 space separated integers — N, M and K — denoting the number of apples, number of oranges, and number of gold coins our little Chef has.  Output For each test case, output the minimum possible difference between the number of apples and oranges that Chef can achieve.  Constraints   1 ≤ T ≤ 100   1 ≤ N, M, K ≤ 100    Example Input  3 3 4 1 5 2 1 3 4 3  Output 0 2 0  Explanation  Test 1: Chef will buy 1 apple by paying 1 gold coin and will have equal number of apples and oranges. Test 2: Chef will buy 1 orange by paying 1 gold coin and will have 5 apples and 3 oranges.  
  In olden days finding square roots seemed to be difficult but nowadays it can be easily done using in-built functions available across many languages .  Assume that you happen to hear the above words and you want to give a try in finding the square root of any given integer using in-built functions. So here's your chance.

Tuzik is a little dog. But despite the fact he is still a puppy he already knows about the pretty things that coins are. He knows that for every coin he can get very tasty bone from his master. He believes that some day he will find a treasure and have loads of bones. And finally he found something interesting. A wooden chest containing N coins! But as you should remember, Tuzik is just a little dog, and so he can't open it by himself. Actually, the only thing he can really do is barking. He can use his barking to attract nearby people and seek their help. He can set the loudness of his barking very precisely, and therefore you can assume that he can choose to call any number of people, from a minimum of 1, to a maximum of K. When people come and open the chest they divide all the coins between them in such a way that everyone will get the same amount of coins and this amount is maximal possible. If some coins are not used they will leave it on the ground and Tuzik will take them after they go away. Since Tuzik is clearly not a fool, he understands that his profit depends on the number of people he will call. While Tuzik works on his barking, you have to find the maximum possible number of coins he can get.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each of next T lines contains 2 space-separated integers: N and K, for this test case.  Output For each test case output one integer - the maximum possible number of coins Tuzik can get.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 50 1 ≤ N, K ≤ 10^5   Example Input: 2 5 2 11 3  Output: 1 2  Explanation In the first example he should call two people. Each of them will take 2 coins and they will leave 1 coin for Tuzik. In the second example he should call 3 people.  
Tanu has got interested in signs and gestures that we use for communication. One such gesture is the head-bob.When we want to signal "Yes" to someone, we move the head up-and-down. For "No", the head is moved left-and-right, rotating about the vertical axis. There is a peculiar way of gesturing "Yes", commonly seen in India, by moving head sideways (rotating about the forward-back axis). This is called the  Indian head-bob. Tanu observed many people on the railways station, and made a list of gestures that they made. Usual "Yes" gesture is recorded as "Y", no as "N" and Indian "Yes" gesture as "I". (Assume no foreigner uses the Indian "Yes" gesture and vice-versa). Identify which of them were Indians, which were not Indian, and which one you cannot be sure about.  Input First line contains T, number of people observed by Tanu.Each person is described in two lines. First line of the description contains a single integer N, the number of gestures recorded for this person. Next line contains a string of N characters, each character can be "Y", "N" or "I".  Output For each person, print "INDIAN" if he/she is from India, "NOT INDIAN" if not from India, and "NOT SURE" if the information is insufficient to make a decision.  Constraints  For 30 points: 1 ≤ T,N ≤ 100For 70 points: 1 ≤ T,N ≤ 1000 Example Input: 35NNNYY6NNINNI4NNNNOutput: NOT INDIANINDIANNOT SURE

There are N students living in the dormitory of Berland State University. Each of them sometimes wants to use the kitchen, so the head of the dormitory came up with a timetable for kitchen's usage in order to avoid the conflicts:  The first student starts to use the kitchen at the time 0 and should finish the cooking not later than at the time A1. The second student starts to use the kitchen at the time A1 and should finish the cooking not later than at the time A2. And so on. The N-th student starts to use the kitchen at the time AN-1 and should finish the cooking not later than at the time AN  The holidays in Berland are approaching, so today each of these N students wants to cook some pancakes. The i-th student needs Bi units of time to cook. The students have understood that probably not all of them will be able to cook everything they want. How many students will be able to cook without violating the schedule?  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of students. The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the moments of time by when the corresponding student should finish cooking. The third line contains N space-separated integers B1, B2, ..., BN denoting the time required for each of the students to cook.  Output For each test case, output a single line containing the number of students that will be able to finish the cooking.  Constraints Should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have. Format it like:  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^4 0 < A1 <  A2 < ... < AN < 10^9 1 ≤ Bi ≤ 10^9   Example Input: 2 3 1 10 15 1 10 3 3 10 20 30 15 5 20  Output: 2 1  Explanation Example case 1. The first student has 1 unit of time - the moment 0. It will be enough for her to cook. The second student has 9 units of time, but wants to cook for 10 units of time, and won't fit in time. The third student has 5 units of time and will fit in time, because needs to cook only for 3 units of time. Example case 2. Each of students has 10 units of time, but only the second one will be able to fit in time. 
 You might have heard about our new goodie distribution program aka the "Laddu Accrual System". This problem is designed to give you a glimpse of its rules. You can read the page once before attempting the problem if you wish, nonetheless we will be providing all the information needed here itself.   Laddu Accrual System is our new goodie distribution program. In this program, we will be distributing Laddus in place of goodies for your winnings and various other activities (described below), that you perform on our system. Once you collect enough number of Laddus, you can then redeem them to get yourself anything from a wide range of CodeChef goodies.   Let us know about various activities and amount of laddus you get corresponding to them.  Contest Win (CodeChef’s Long, Cook-Off, LTIME, or any contest hosted with us) : 300 + Bonus (Bonus = 20 - contest rank). Note that if your rank is > 20, then you won't get any bonus. Top Contributor on Discuss : 300 Bug Finder	: 50 - 1000 (depending on the bug severity). It may also fetch you a CodeChef internship! Contest Hosting	 : 50   You can do a checkout for redeeming laddus once a month. The minimum laddus redeemable at Check Out are 200 for Indians and 400 for the rest of the world.   You are given history of various activities of a user. The user has not redeemed any of the its laddus accrued.. Now the user just wants to redeem as less amount of laddus he/she can, so that the laddus can last for as long as possible. Find out for how many maximum number of months he can redeem the laddus.   Input  The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting number of test cases For each test case:  First line contains an integer followed by a string denoting activities, origin respectively, where activities denotes number of activities of the user, origin denotes whether the user is Indian or the rest of the world. origin can be "INDIAN" or "NON_INDIAN". For each of the next activities lines, each line contains an activity. 			An activity can be of four types as defined above.  Contest Win : Input will be of form of CONTEST_WON rank, where rank denotes the rank of the user. Top Contributor : Input will be of form of TOP_CONTRIBUTOR. Bug Finder : Input will be of form of BUG_FOUND severity, where severity denotes the severity of the bug. Contest Hosting : Input will be of form of CONTEST_HOSTED.       Output  For each test case, find out the maximum number of months for which the user can redeem the laddus accrued.   Constraints  1 ≤ T, activities ≤ 100 1 ≤ rank ≤ 5000 50 ≤ severity ≤ 1000   Example Input: 2 4 INDIAN CONTEST_WON 1 TOP_CONTRIBUTOR BUG_FOUND 100 CONTEST_HOSTED 4 NON_INDIAN CONTEST_WON 1 TOP_CONTRIBUTOR BUG_FOUND 100 CONTEST_HOSTED  Output: 3 1  Explanation In the first example,  For winning contest with rank 1, user gets 300 + 20 - 1 = 319 laddus. For top contributor, user gets 300 laddus. For finding a bug with severity of 100, user gets 100 laddus. For hosting a contest, user gets 50 laddus.   So, overall user gets 319 + 300 + 100 + 50 = 769 laddus. Now, the user is an Indian user, he can redeem only 200 laddus per month. So, for first three months, he will redeem 200 * 3 = 600 laddus. The remaining 169 laddus, he can not redeem as he requires at least 200 laddues in a month to redeem. So, answer is 3.  In the second example, user is a non-Indian user, he can redeem 400 laddues per month. So, in the first month, he will redeem 400 laddus. The remaining 369 laddus, he can not redeem as he requires at least 400 laddues in a month to redeem. So, answer is 1.

Note that it is not necessary that if a boy x likes girl y, then girl y should like boy x. You know that if there are two different boys x and y, who both like girl z, then there will be a collision. Can you calculate the number of different collisions at this party? Note that order of boys in the collision doesn't matter.  Input The first line contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers N, M denoting the number of boys and girls, respectively. Each of the following N lines contain M characters, each of them is either '0' or '1'.  Output For each test case output a single line containing an integer corresponding to the number of collisions at the party.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ N, M ≤ 10   Example Input: 2 4 3 111 100 110 000 2 2 10 01  Output: 4 0   Explanation Example Case 1. All three boys like the first girl, so there are (1, 2, 1), (1, 3, 1), (2, 3, 1) collisions with her. Boys 1 and 3 both like the second girl so this is one more collision. Only one boy likes the third girl, so there are no collisions with her and thus we have 4 collisions total. Example Case 2. For each girl there is only one boy who likes her, so there are no collisions at all.

 You have a matrix of size N * N with rows numbered through 1 to N from top to bottom and columns through 1 to N from left to right. It contains all values from 1 to N^2, i.e. each value from 1 to N^2 occurs exactly once in the matrix.   Now, you start from the cell containing value 1, and from there visit the cell with value 2, and then from there visit the cell with value 3, and so on till you have visited cell containing the number N^2. In a single step, you can move from a cell to one of its adjacent cells. Two cells are said to be adjacent to each other if they share an edge between them.

Leha is playing a very interesting game. The game will be played on a rectangular grid consisting of N rows and M columns. Initially all the cells of the grid are uncolored. Leha's initial score is zero. At each turn, he chooses some cell that is yet not colored, and colors that cell. The score obtained in this step will be number of neighboring colored cells of the cell that Leha colored in this step. Two cells are neighbors of each other if they share a side between them. The game will end when all the cells are colored. Finally, total score obtained at the end of the game will sum of score obtained in each turn. Leha wants to know what maximum score he can get? Can you please help him in finding this out?  Input The first line contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. T test cases follow. Each of the following T lines contains two space-separated integers N, M denoting the dimensions of the grid.  Output For each test case, output a single line containing an integer corresponding to the maximal possible score Leha can obtain.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ N, M ≤ 1 000   Example Input: 1 2 2  Output: 4  Explanation Leha can obtain total score 4 in the following way.  In the first step, he colors down left cell, all the neighboring cells of this cell are uncolored. So, it adds 0 to total score. In second step, he can color upper right cell, it also adds total 0 to the score. In third step, he can color top left cell. There are two neighboring cell of this cell, both of which are colored. So, this add 2 to the score. In the last step, he can choose the remaining down right cell. There are two neighboring cell of this cell, both of which are colored. So, this also add 2 to the score.   Leha can't obtain a score more than 4. Hence 4 is the answer.  
 Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) is a mathematical notation where every operator follows all of its operands. For instance, to add three and four, one would write "3 4 +" rather than "3 + 4". If there are multiple operations, the operator is given immediately after its second operand; so the expression written "3 − 4 + 5" would be written "3 4 − 5 +" first subtract 4 from 3, then add 5 to that.   Transform the algebraic expression with brackets into RPN form.   You can assume that for the test cases below only single letters will be used, brackets [] will not be used and each expression has only one RPN form (no expressions like a*b*c)    Input  The first line contains t, the number of test cases (less then 100).   Followed by t lines, containing an expression to be translated to RPN form, where the length of the expression is less then 400.   Output  The expressions in RPN form, one per line.   Example  Input: 3 (a+(b*c)) ((a+b)*(z+x)) ((a+t)*((b+(a+c))^(c+d)))  Output: abc*+ ab+zx+* at+bac++cd+^* 
  The citizens of Byteland regularly play a game. They have blocks each denoting some integer from 0 to 9. These are arranged together in a random manner without seeing to form different numbers keeping in mind that the first block is never a 0. Once they form a number they read in the reverse order to check if the number and its reverse is the same. If both are same then the player wins. We call such numbers palindrome Ash happens to see this game and wants to simulate the same in the computer. As the first step he wants to take an input from the user and check if the number is palindrome and declare if the user wins or not   Input  The first line of the input contains T, the number of test cases. This is followed by T lines containing an integer N.   Output  For each input output "wins" if the number is a palindrome and "losses" if not.

 Some programming contest problems are really tricky: not only do they require a different output format from what you might have expected, but also the sample output does not show the difference. For an example, let us look at permutations. A permutation of the integers 1 to n is an ordering of these integers. So the natural way to represent a permutation is to list the integers in this order. With n = 5, a permutation might look like 2, 3, 4, 5, 1. However, there is another possibility of representing a permutation: You create a list of numbers where the i-th number is the position of the integer i in the permutation. Let us call this second possibility an inverse permutation. The inverse permutation for the sequence above is 5, 1, 2, 3, 4.  An ambiguous permutation is a permutation which cannot be distinguished from its inverse permutation. The permutation 1, 4, 3, 2 for example is ambiguous, because its inverse permutation is the same. To get rid of such annoying sample test cases, you have to write a program which detects if a given permutation is ambiguous or not.   Input Specification The input contains several test cases. The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000). Then a permutation of the integers 1 to n follows in the next line. There is exactly one space character between consecutive integers. You can assume that every integer between 1 and n appears exactly once in the permutation.  The last test case is followed by a zero.   Output Specification For each test case output whether the permutation is ambiguous or not. Adhere to the format shown in the sample output.   Sample Input 4 1 4 3 2 5 2 3 4 5 1 1 1 0   Sample Output ambiguous not ambiguous ambiguous

Princess Rupsa saw one of her friends playing a special game. The game goes as follows:  N+1 numbers occur sequentially (one at a time) from A0 to AN. You must write the numbers on a sheet of paper, such that A0 is written first. The other numbers are written according to an inductive rule — after Ai-1 numbers have been written in a row, then Ai can be written at either end of the row. That is, you first write A0, and then A1 can be written on its left or right to make A0A1 or A1A0, and so on. Ai must be written before writing Aj, for every i < j. For a move in which you write a number Ai (i>0), your points increase by the product of Ai and its neighbour. (Note that for any move it will have only one neighbour as you write the number at an end). Total score of a game is the score you attain after placing all the N + 1 numbers.  Princess Rupsa wants to find out the sum of scores obtained by all possible different gameplays. Two gameplays are different, if after writing down all N + 1 numbers, when we read from left to right, there exists some position i, at which the gameplays have aj and ak written at the i^th position such that j ≠ k. But since she has recently found her true love, a frog Prince, and is in a hurry to meet him, you must help her solve the problem as fast as possible. Since the answer can be very large, print the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.  Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N. The second line contains N + 1 space-separated integers denoting A0 to AN.   Output   For each test case, output a single line containing an integer denoting the answer.    Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ Ai ≤ 10^9   Sub tasks  Example Input: 2 1 1 2 2 1 2 1  Output: 4 14  Explanation  There are 2 possible gameplays. A0A1 which gives score of 2 and  A1A0 which also gives score of 2. So the answer is 2 + 2 = 4  
 Vadim and Roman like discussing challenging problems with each other. One day Vadim told his friend following problem:  Given N points on a plane. Each point p is defined by it's two integer coordinates — px and py. The distance between points a and b is min(|ax - bx|, |ay - by|). You should choose a starting point and make a route visiting every point exactly once, i.e. if we write down numbers of points in order you visit them we should obtain a permutation. Of course, overall distance walked should be as small as possible. The number of points may be up to 40.  "40? Maybe 20? Are you kidding?" – asked Roman. "No, it's not a joke" – replied Vadim. So Roman had nothing to do, but try to solve this problem. Since Roman is really weak in problem solving and you are the only friend, except Vadim, with whom Roman can discuss challenging tasks, he has nobody else to ask for help, but you!   Input Input description. The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of points on a plane. The following N lines contain two space-separated integers each — coordinates of points.  Output Output description. Output the answer for every test case in a separate line. The answer for every test case is a permutation of length N. In case there are several solutions that lead to minimal distance walked, you should choose the lexicographically smallest one. Let P denote such permutation. To make output smaller, you should output H(P). H(P) = P1 xor P2 xor ... xor PN. Have a look at the example and it's explanation for better understanding.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ N ≤ 40 0 ≤ absolute value of each coordinate ≤ 1000 1 ≤ sum over all N in a single test file ≤ 120   Example Input: 2 2 1 2 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 3 Output: 3 0   Explanation For the first test case permutation [1, 2] is optimal.  1 xor 2 = 3.  For the second one both [2, 3, 1] and [1, 3, 2] lead us to the shortest walk, but the second one is lexicographically smaller. So the answer is H([1, 3, 2]) = 1 xor 3 xor 2 = 0 .

 The game of billiards involves two players knocking 3 balls around on a green baize table. Well, there is more to it, but for our purposes this is sufficient.  The game consists of several rounds and in each round both players obtain a score, based on how well they played. Once all the rounds have been played, the total score of each player is determined by adding up the scores in all the rounds and the player with the higher total score is declared the winner.  The Siruseri Sports Club organises an annual billiards game where the top two players of Siruseri play against each other. The Manager of Siruseri Sports Club decided to add his own twist to the game by changing the rules for determining the winner. In his version, at the end of each round the leader and her current lead are calculated. Once all the rounds are over the player who had the maximum lead at the end of any round in the game is declared the winner.   Consider the following score sheet for a game with 5 rounds:       Round     Player 1       Player 2        1             140                 82       2              89                 134       3              90                 110       4              112              106       5              88                  90   The total scores of both players, the leader and the lead after each round for this game is given below:      Round      Player 1       Player 2     Leader     Lead        1               140           	 82        Player 1     58       2               229           	216       Player 1     13       3               319           	326       Player 2      7       4               431           	432       Player 2      1       5               519           	522       Player 2      3   The winner of this game is Player 1 as he had the maximum lead (58 at the end of round 1) during the game.  Your task is to help the Manager find the winner and the winning lead. You may assume that the scores will be such that there will always be a single winner.  That is, there are no ties. Input  The first line of the input will contain a single integer N (N ≤ 10000) indicating the number of rounds in the game.  Lines 2,3,...,N+1 describe the scores of the two players in the N rounds. Line i+1 contains two integer Si and Ti, the scores of the Player 1 and 2 respectively, in round i.  You may assume that 1 ≤ Si ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ Ti ≤ 1000. Output  Your output must consist of a single line containing two integers W and L, where W is 1 or 2 and indicates the winner and L is the maximum lead attained by the winner. Example Input:  5 140 82 89 134 90 110 112 106 88 90  Output:  1 58 
Chef belongs to a very rich family which owns many gold mines. Today, he brought N gold coins and decided to form a triangle using these coins. Isn't it strange? Chef has a unusual way of forming a triangle using gold coins, which is described as follows:  He puts 1 coin in the 1^st row. then puts 2 coins in the 2^nd row. then puts 3 coins in the 3^rd row.  and so on as shown in the given figure.   Chef is interested in forming a triangle with maximum possible height using at most N coins. Can you tell him the maximum possible height of the triangle?  Input The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The first and the only line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the number of gold coins Chef has.  Output For each test case, output a single line containing an integer corresponding to the maximum possible height of the triangle that Chef can get.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^9   Example  Input 3 3 5 7  Output 2 2 3   Explanation  Test 1: Chef can't form a triangle with height > 2 as it requires atleast 6 gold coins. Test 2: Chef can't form a triangle with height > 2 as it requires atleast 6 gold coins. Test 3: Chef can't form a triangle with height > 3 as it requires atleast 10 gold coins.

 Chef wants to implement wildcard pattern matching supporting only the wildcard '?'. The wildcard character '?' can be substituted by any single lower case English letter for matching. He has two strings X and Y of equal length, made up of lower case letters and the character '?'. He wants to know whether the strings X and Y can be matched or not.  Input The first line of input contain an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines, the first line contains the string X and the second contains the string Y.  Output For each test case, output a single line with the word Yes if the strings can be matched, otherwise output No.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 50 Both X and Y have equal length and the length is between 1 and 10. Both X and Y consist of lower case letters and the character '?'.   Example Input: 2 s?or? sco?? stor? sco??  Output: Yes No  Explanation  First Example:  There are several ways the two strings can be matched, one of those is "score".   Second Example:  There is no way to match the strings.  
  	A version control system(VCS) is a repository of files, often the files for the source code of computer programs, with monitored access. Every change made to the source is tracked, along with who made the change, why they made it, and references to problems fixed, or enhancements introduced, by the change.   	Version control systems are essential for any form of distributed, collaborative development. Whether it is the history of a wiki page or large software development project, the ability to track each change as it was made, and to reverse changes when necessary can make all the difference between a well managed and controlled process and an uncontrolled ‘first come, first served’ system. It can also serve as a mechanism for due diligence for software projects.   	In this problem we'll consider a simplified model of a development project. Let's suppose, that there are N source files in the project. All the source files are distinct and numbered from 1 to N.   	A VCS, that is used for maintaining the project, contains two sequences of source files. The first sequence contains the source files, that are ignored by the VCS. If a source file is not in the first sequence, then it's considered to be unignored. The second sequence contains the source files, that are tracked by the VCS. If a source file is not in the second sequence, then it's considered to be untracked. A source file can either be or not be in any of these two sequences.   	Your task is to calculate two values: the number of source files of the project, that are both tracked and ignored, and the number of source files of the project, that are both untracked and unignored.   Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of the test case description contains three integers N, M and K denoting the number of source files in the project, the number of ignored source files and the number of tracked source files. The second line contains M distinct integers denoting the sequence A of ignored source files. The sequence is strictly increasing. The third line contains K distinct integers denoting the sequence B of tracked source files. The sequence is strictly increasing.  Output For each test case, output a single line containing two integers: the number of the source files, that are both tracked and ignored, and the number of the source files, that are both untracked and unignored.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ M, K ≤ N ≤ 100 1 ≤ A1 < A2 < ... < AM ≤ N 1 ≤ B1 < B2 < ... < BK ≤ N   Example Input: 2 7 4 6 1 4 6 7 1 2 3 4 6 7 4 2 2 1 4 3 4  Output: 4 1 1 1   Explanation  	In the first test case, the source files {1, 4, 6, 7} are both tracked and ignored, the source file {5} is both untracked and unignored.   	In the second test case, the source file {4} is both tracked and ignored, the source file {2} is both untracked and unignored.  
Chef is going to participate in a new quiz show: "Who dares to be a millionaire?" According to the rules of the game, contestants must answer N questions. The quiz being famous for its difficulty, each question has 26 candidate answers, but only one of which is correct. Answers are denoted by capital Latin letters from A to Z. Chef knows all the questions that can be asked, and for each of them he knows the answer candidate he will choose (some of them can be incorrect). For each question, we'll tell you Chef's answer to it. The game goes on as follows. First, all the questions are shuffled randomly. Then, a contestant is asked these questions one-by-one in the new shuffled order. If the contestant answers any question incorrectly, the game is over. Total winnings of the contestant are calculated as follows. Let X denote the number of questions answered correctly by the contestant. Depending on this value, the winnings are determined: W0 dollars is the amount won for X = 0, W1 dollars is for X = 1, and so on till X = N. Note that the game was invented by a twisted mind, and so a case where Wi ≥ Wi + 1 for some 0 ≤ i ≤ N − 1 is possible. Chef is interested in finding the maximum possible winnings that he can amass.  Input The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The  description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of questions. Next line contains N capital Latin letters denoting the correct answers to these questions. Next line contains N capital Latin letters denoting answers given by Chef to these questions. Next line contains N + 1 space-separated integers W0, W1, ..., WN denoting the winnings for 0, 1, ..., N correct answers.  Output For each test case, output a single line containing the value of maximum possible winnings that Chef can get.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 500 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000 0 ≤ Wi ≤ 10^9   Example Input: 3 5 ABCDE EBCDA 0 10 20 30 40 50 4 CHEF QUIZ 4 3 2 1 0 8 ABBABAAB ABABABAB 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100  Output: 30 4 100   Explanation Example case 1. If questions will be placed in order: 2^nd (Chef's answer is B, which is correct), 3^rd (Chef's answer is C, and it is correct as well), 4^th (Chef's answer is D, and he is right), 5^th (Chef's answer is A but correct answer is E and the game is over), 1^st, Chef will correctly answer 3 questions, and therefore win 30 dollars. Example case 2. Chef's answers for all questions are incorrect, so his winnings are W0 dollars. Example case 3. Since all Wi are equal to 100 dollars, Chef will win this sum in any possible case. 
 The Beginning This is a story of the time when human kind had spread its presence through out the galaxy and had established an empire in its own right . To rule the galaxy effectively and maintain law and order , the galaxy had been divided into sixty four sectors and laws were imposed as to how trade and other activities that were to take place be implemented  , of which the the vitals ones being : One can trade only a fixed amount of commodities , which has been predefined by the senate , in a sector . One can travel only to the sectors just after or before a given sector and in no other way . The map of the galaxy being :             64  63  62  61  60  59  58  57           49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56           48  47  46  45  44  43  42  41           33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40           32  31  30  29  28  27  26  25           17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24           16  15  14  13  12  11  10  09           01  02  03  04  05  06  07  08 If you are in Sector 05 , you can either go to Sector 06 or Sector 04 . If you are in Sector 09 , you can either go to Sector 08 or Sector 10 . To extend the empire further , the Senate decides to send an expedition beyond their current reaches of the Empire . The expedition was to travel through the galaxy following the laws and and get to Sector 64 . There , the Expedition would be fitted with Hyper Drives which would take them beyond the Galaxy . So a crew of the best explorers were chosen for the mission and they left on the Expedition , unaware of what lay ahead .  The Route  The space craft can carry a maximum amount of fuel of 5 units . It starts its journey from Sector 1 , where Earth is located and is given the amount of fuel present on Earth . For every sector traversed into , it loses one unit of fuel . The spacecraft may land in  any sector to refill its fuel supplies . The amount of fuel available on a base varies between 1 to 5 . The space craft has to pick up all the fuel that there is on offer at a given base in accordance with the trade agreements and it can not carry more fuel than its maximum capacity which implies that the maximum fuel on a base station it lands on can not be more than the difference between its maximum fuel capacity and fuel left in its reserve . When it lands on a base station , its data base is uploaded with the information about the amount of fuel present in the next five immediate bases based on which the captain decides their next base halt . The captain decides their halt in a way so as to ensure that they have the maximum amount of fuel left by the time they traverse into the last sector in their current database (which must not be their destination , Sector 64 ) and in case more than one option are available , the one that is farthest from their current location is chosen . In case the last sector on their database is Sector 64 , and the space craft can travel the distance without making any further landings , the captain will ensure that they make no further landings even if by the time they traverse into Sector 64 , they have no fuel left .   The captain also ensures that information about their next halt is sent to the head of the current base station before proceeding so that a rescue mission can be carried in case something goes wrong .

On reaching the final frontier of the Galaxy , Sector 64 , the crew found themselves in a situation they had not anticipated .  The base they were supposed to land on was completely destroyed without any trace . All they found on the base was a Teleport channel , an encrypted key and some encrypted data , apparently left behind by mistake . The captain decided to investigate and find out where the Teleport channel leads to and what information were left behind . To do this , he has to decrypt the key and find a code to decode the information and unlock the Teleport channel .  The key had been encrypted using an ancient encryption algorithm . In this algorithm , a digit is preceded as well as succeeded by a certain number of characters which decides the position of the digit in the unencrypted code .  The encrypted key has the following characters and their relative weight-age :  Z      the basic charcacter ( may be considered of unit value ) Q      equivalent to 3 Z E      equivalent to 5 Z T      equivalent to 7 Z U      equivalent to 9 Z  The characters which precede a digit add to its weight-age and which succeed a digit subtract from its weigh-age . The position of a digit in the unencrypted code is decided on the basis of its weight-age , the digit with the least weight-age is the left most and the digit with the most weight-age is the right most . In case of same weight-age for two digits , the digit that appears later in the encrypted key appears earlier in the unencrypted code .  Example :  ZZZE5UU7QQZZ7T3QQQQ4EEZ  weight-age of 5 : (3x1) + (1x5) - (2x9) = -10 weight-age of 7 : (2x9) - (2x3) - (2x1) = 10 weight-age of second 7 : (2x3)+(2x1) - (1x7) = 1 weight-age of 3 : (1x7) - (4x3) = - 5 weight-age of 4 : (4x3) - (2x5) - (1x1) = 1   Implying the unencrypted code is :  53477  Input  n N1 N2 N3 N4 .................N200 N1 N2 N3 N4 .................N200 ............ ............ n times  Where :  n : Number of test cases . 0 < n < 32000 .

On being teleported through the teleport channel , the crew reach Earth and find that the invaders have attacked the planet . They decide to join the war against the invaders .  Based on information available , the crew of the ship decides to analyze the probability of the Mother-ship of the invaders being in a sector and then focus their attacks on the ones with highest probability .  They decide the probability of the Mother-ship being in a particular sector based on the amount of protection it gets from the supporting Frigates in the grid . There are eight Frigates in the grid and no two of them are in the same sector .  The protection a sector receives from a Frigate is decided as follows :  Every Frigate has the ability to protect any sector in the row , column and diagonal it is located in . But it's ability to protect is maximum when the sector is just adjacent to it in it's row or column ( let us just call it as Protection Status 14 ) and then gradually falls at a rate of 2 units per sector as the distance increases ( as in , the sector next to its adjacent sector has Protection Status as 12 and so on ) . The protection of a sector along its diagonal is half the protection of a sector at same distance along the row or column , as in , the Protection Status of a sector adjacent to a frigate along its diagonals is 7 and it falls of as the distance increases at a rate of 1 unit per sector .  Also , if a sector is protected by more than one frigate , the Protection Status of that sector is the sum of the protections provided by all the Frigates for the sector in the grid .  Example  The map of the galaxy being :                  64  63  62  61  60  59  58  57                49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56                48  47  46  45  44  43  42  41                33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40                32  31  30  29  28  27  26  25                17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24                16  15  14  13  12  11  10  09                01  02  03  04  05  06  07  08    In the 8x8 grid , if a Frigate is at Sector 12  , it protects the following sectors ( with the Protection Status in bracket ) .  Row Elements : 11(14) , 10(12) , 09(10) , 13(14) , 14(12) , 15(10) , 16(08)  . Column Elements : 05(14) , 21(14) , 28(12) , 37(10) , 44(08) , 53 (06) .

If more than one sector has same protection status which also happens to be the highest , the sector numbers are to be output in an increasing order .

In the computer science class at the school in Byteland, the teacher handed out the following assignment as homework:   "For an integer n, let bn denote the bit parity of the binary representation of n, i.e. bnn has an even number of ones when written down in the binary system, and bnbn, for n ≥0,  form an infinite sequence of bits (zeros and ones). Given a sequence cc0, ..., cp-1) of p bits, find the first occurrence of sequence c as a subsequence of b (i.e., the smallest value of index k such that for all i between 0 and p-1, we have ci = bi+k)."  And the teacher gave his students several short sequences c, asking them to provide the answers next day. Most, as expected, wrote programs to solve the task. Only Johnny computed the results by hand, claiming (quite correctly) that it was quicker that way. The teacher, slightly exasperated, decided to teach Johnny a lesson, and prepared a harder assignment, just for him.  "Given a sequence cc0, ..., cp-1) of p bits, for each s between 0 and p-1, compute the first occurrence of the prefix (c0, ..., cs) of sequence c as a subsequence of b."  And to be doubly sure that Johnny does his homework using a computer, the teacher gave him some really long sequences to deal with. Now, Johnny is in a bit of a spot, because he has never bothered to learn to program. Please help him out!    Input The first line of input contains a positive integer t < 10, describing the number of tests. Exactly t test cases follow. Each test case is given in two lines. The first line contains integer p (1 ≤ p ≤ 10^6, the length of sequence k). The next line contains exactly p space-separated numbers (0 or 1), denoting successive elements of sequence c.   Output For each test case, print a line containing exactly p space-separated numbers, corresponding to the indexes of the first occurrence of successive prefixes of c as subsequences of b. All indexes are numbered starting from zero. If there is no such occurrence, output -1.  Example  Input: 1 9 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0  Output: 1 2 4 4 8 8 8 -1 -1   Explanation: The first 16 elements of b are: 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0  The prefix '1' first appears in b at index 1, The prefix '1 0' first appears in b at index 2, The prefixes '1 0 0' and '1 0 0 1' first appear in b at index 4, ... and so on. There are no occurences of '1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1' in sequence b. 
  Problem description.  Arpit was facing a dillema of whether he could make it the higher divison known as Division 1 of competitive coders in his school . To confirm his spot his Computer Science professor gave him a task :  We define AND operation as it is defined normally where we get a output 1 if both inputs are 1 otherwise the output is 0 . The problem involves two matrices A and B having n rows and m columns where the formation of B matrix is done from A matrix as follows :  B(i , j) = A(i,1) & A(i,2) & ....A(i,m) & A(1,j) & A(2,j) ....& A(n,j)  ( More formally each element of B matrix is the AND of all elements in the i row and j column of matrix A )  You will be given B matrix and you have to tell whether its possible to form A matrix or not as "YES" or "NO" As it has been a long time for Arpit not making Division 1 he asks you for help !!    Input The first line consists 'n and m' where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns  Next n lines contains m numbers representing the B matrix  Output "YES" or "NO" whether its possible to form matrix A or not !!  Constraints 1<=n , m<=100  Example Input: 2 3 1 0 1 0 0 0  Output: YES

  You get bored sometimes and love to play the game Chain reaction. This game is played upon a board of size RxC. Initially, the board is empty. In each turn, you can place an atom in any cell you want. After each turn, if the number of atoms in a cell becomes greater than 3, it will explode and one atom will spread to each of the four sides. If any other atoms remain( ie no of atoms > 4), it remains in the same cell. As you can see, this will create a chain reaction if the adjacent cells contain 3 atoms already.  If explosion occurs at edge cells or corner cells, some atoms are lost permanently. This also makes sure that the board will always reach a stable state after some number of explosions.      You will be given the board size and the state of the board after some moves. Next you will make N moves. Write a program that prints the final stable state of the board after N moves.   Input First line contains the number of test cases T. First line of each test case will have 2 integers R and C, R is the row size, C is the column size. Then R lines follow, each line containing C integers, denoting the number of atoms at that cell. Next line will have a single integer N , the number of moves that you make N lines follow, each containing two integers, x and y denoting the cell (x, y) where you add a new atom.     Output For each test case print the final state of the board. It must contain R lines, each having C space separated integers.    Constraints 1<=T<=100 2<=R<=20 , 2<=C<=20 Number of atoms in each cell will be less than 4. 0<=x 1<=N<=1000   Example Input: 1 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0   Output:  1 0 1 0 0 0 2 1 2 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 2 1 2 0 0 0 1 0 0    Explanation  After adding the atom to (2, 2), it explodes which will cause all four adjacent cells (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2) to explode. This will lead to explosion of the cell (2, 2) for the second time as all those four cells sends back an atom to this cell. After adding the atom to (0, 0), no explosion occurs. 
Statement                     Mario is one the most famous video games ever. In this problem, we will be helping Mario save the princess(again :P). In this game of mario, each world will be represented by a 2-D rectangular grid. There are multiple worlds and all the worlds are of size RxC. The world contains many objects each covering exactly one cell. The cell with ‘S’ denotes Mario’s starting position. A cell with ‘.’ denotes an empty cell over which Mario can walk safely. From that cell he can move to any of its 4 adjacent cells (which share an edge with it). A cell with ‘D’ denotes a pipe that leads to the world below. A cell with ‘U’ denotes a pipe that leads to the world above. If Mario enters a cell containing a pipe, he must enter the pipe. A cell with ‘C’ represents a coin and Mario collects these. After collecting the coin, the cell becomes an empty cell. A cell with ‘#’ denotes bricks and Mario can’t enter this cell no matter what. A cell with ‘M’ denotes the monster(Bowser), Mario has to defeat Bowser to save the princess. Mario initially start from an empty cell. Our Mario is very determined and so he will be always able to defeat Bowser on a 1 on 1 battle. But he is greedy and will always want to collect all the coins before going to save the princess. If he is not able to collect all the coins, he won’t save the princess! Help Mario to find the minimum number of steps to do this feat. Note: 	If ‘U’ is present in topmost world or ‘D’ is present in the bottommost world, Mario can’t enter the cell. Input format: 	Input contains multiple test cases.         First line of each test case will have 3 integers R, C and W. ‘R X C’ represents Grid dimension and ‘W’ represents number of worlds. It will be followed by R X W lines. Each line will have ‘C’ characters. First R lines describe the first world, second R lines describe the second world and so on upto W worlds. 	Input ends by the line, “0 0 0”. Output format: 	For each test case, print a single line “Mario saved the princess in K steps” where K is the minimum number of steps if he defeat the monster else Print “Mario failed to save princess”. constraints: 	1<=R,C<=15 	1<=W<=9 	0<=C<=10 	All characters in the grid will be from the set {‘S’, ‘.’, ‘M’, ‘C’, ‘D’, ‘U’, ‘#’ } INPUT:        	3 3 2         S.M         C#.

  Geek Sundaram lives in Geek City. As he is an ardent coder, he never gets to go out and leads a sedentary lifestyle. One day he realises he is getting fat and decides to something about it. He decides to go jogging every morning. Geek City is a rectangular city with M X N grids. Each grid can be occupied by a building or can be empty. Occupied grids are marked using '#' and empty grids are denoted by '*'. The residents of Geek city can travel through any grid but the Mayor of Geek City has decreed that residents should not jog inside buildings. From a grid, Geek can go left, right, up or down if there is a grid in that direction. Naturally, Geek Sundaram has to jog along a path of empty grids. The length of a path is the number of grids present in that path. Also, Geek city is constructed such that, while jogging along a path of empty grids, one will not revisit the same grid again without changing his/her direction. Can you help Geek find the length of the longest path he can jog along?    Input  The first line of the input contains two integers M and N denoting the number of rows and columns of grids. Each of the following M lines have N characters, the characters being either '#' or '*'.     Output Output a single line containing the length of the longest path Geek can jog along.  Constraints  1 ≤ M,N ≤ 500     Example Input: 3 4 #*#* #*** ###*  Output: 5   
  To attain inner peace  Geek Sundaram  has to pass through the "Hall of Valley of Death". The floor of this hall is a square with length 100 m. It is laid with square tiles of size  1 X 1  arranged over the entire hall. But, at some places in the hall tiles are broken. The moment a person enters the hall, the underworld awakens and dead souls emerge from these broken tiles. The only way to escape from these evil souls is to completely cover the broken locations with magic planks from the room of requirements. Each plank has size 100 X 1 and can only be placed parallel to either sides of the floor. Now Geek Sundaram has to save himself from these evil souls. He figures out that he has to use the minimum number of planks possible. Please help Geek Sundaram to attain inner peace.  Input   The first line of the input is a positive integer t <= 30, denoting the number of halls.  The descriptions for the t halls follow one after the other.  Hall Description:   The first line of the hall description is a positive integer n (n  <=  10000), denoting the number of broken tile locations.  This is followed by the n lines, one for each broken tile location.  Each line contains two integers x y (0 <= x, y < 100), separated by a single space, representing the co-ordinates of the broken tile location.     Output The output should consist of t lines, one for each hall. The k^th line in the output should be an integer mk, the minimum number of planks needed for the k^th hall.     Example Input: 2 3 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4   Output: 1 4    
  Geek Sundaram is extremely anxious. He is in a hectic schedule. He has to study for his assessment the next day, watch FRIENDS tv show (in spite of watching every episode more than 5 times.. :P ), prepare questions for the programming contest and also complete his projects. So his friends try to calm him down by advising whether he can complete all his tasks in the given time period.  Given the time taken (in seconds) to study S, to watch TV W, to prepare questions Q and do project  P  and the total time available until the deadline T, print "YES" if Geek can complete all the tasks within the deadline, otherwise print "NO". (quotes for clarity)  P.S. Geek doesn't have the power to multi task  Input  The first line of the input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases. The description of t test cases follows." The first and the only line of each test case contains five integers S, W, Q, P, T as described in the problem.     Output For each test case, output a single line "YES" or "NO".    Constraints  1 ≤  t  ≤ 10 ^6 1 ≤  S, W, Q, P, T  ≤ 10 ^18     Example Input: 2 10 20 30 40 500 1 2 3 4 5  Output: YES NO    
Once Abhi got a call from his friend Priya. Priya needs some help in solving a Matrix problem as she is trapped by a monster. Abhi has X level of intelligence. There is a matrix M of size P*P, which have all values from 1 to P^2. Abhi has to traverse through all the values of the matrix exactly once. He will start his journey from 1, then to P^2, then to 2, then to P^2-1,then to 3 and so on till every value of the matrix covered exactly once. He can move to any of the adjacent cells from a cell(adjacent cells share an edge between them). Moving from a cell to its adjacent cell will reduce intelligence level of Abhi by 1. He can keep moving only when his intelligence level is greater than zero. Abhi has to complete his journey (at the end of the journey X should be greater or equal to zero). If he can complete the journey, Priya will remain alive, otherwise she will eaten by the monster.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains an integer P denoting the size of matrix and an integer X denoting the intelligence level of Abhi. Each of the next P lines contain P integers denoting the values in the rows of the matrix.  Output For each test case, print "ALIVE" if Priya will remain alive else print "DEAD" if she will be eaten up by the monster. Output your answer in a single line without quotes.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ P ≤ 500 0 ≤ X ≤ 10^9   Example Input: 2 2 4 1 4 2 3 3 15 2 7 3 4 1 5 9 8 6  Output: ALIVE DEAD  Explanation Example case 2. He will visit the Matrix in following order (2,2)->(3,1)->(1,1)->(3,2)->(1,3)->(1,2)->(2,1)->(3,3)->(2,3) His intelligence level will be as follows {15}->{13}->{11}->{8}->{5}->{4}->{2}->{-1}->{-2} (not possible) Abhi can not move from number 4 to 6 as he will have insufficient level of intelligence. 
Abhi and his friends (Shanky,Anku and Pandey) love to play with strings. Abhi invented a simple game. He will give a string S to his friends. Shanky and Anku will play the game while Pandey is just a spectator. Shanky will traverse the string from beginning (left to right) while Anku will traverse from last (right to left). Both have to find the first character they encounter during their traversal,that appears only once in the entire string. Winner will be one whose character is alphabetically more superior(has higher ASCII value). When it is not possible to decide the winner by comparing their characters, Pandey will be the winner.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. Each test case contains a string S having only lowercase alphabets ( a..z ).  Output For each test case, output a single line containing "SHANKY" if Shanky is the winner or "ANKU" if Anku is the winner or "PANDEY" if the winner is Pandey. Output your answer without quotes.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 < |S| ≤ 10^5   Example Input: 3 google breakraekb aman  Output: SHANKY PANDEY ANKU   Explanation Example case 2. Both Shanky and Anku can not find any such character. Hence it is not possible to decide the winner between these two. So Pandey is the winner. 
 In mathematics, the absolute value (or modulus) |a| of a real number a is the numerical value of a without regard to its sign. So, for example, the absolute value of 3 is 3, and the absolute value of -3 is also 3. The absolute value of a number may be thought of as its distance from zero.   Input  There is a single positive integer T on the first line of input. It stands for the number of numbers to follow. Then there are T lines, each containing exactly one integer number N ,  -10000 ≤ N ≤ 10000   Output  For every input number N, output a single line containing the absolute value of N.   Example  Input: 4 -9 -4 6 -1 Output: 9 4 6 1

Sherlock Holmes has decided to start a new academy to some of the young lads. He has conducted several tests and finally selected N equally brilliant students.Now he don't know whether to train all the N students or not. Now since Holmes was in a confusion, Watson came up with an idea. He wanted to test the obedience of the students. So during the camp, the students were given some Swiss Chocolates as gifts each time when they passed a level.Now some of them have finished eating all the chocolates, some of them had some remaining. Now to test their team chemistry and IQ skills, Watson told the lads to arrange themselves in such a way that,  number of chocolates of the ith kid should be equal to the sum of   (i-1)th kid and (i-2)th kid. Now they have arranged themselves in an order. Now Sherlock announced that he will select the students who have formed the line according to this order. But since there can be many such small groups among the entire N kids, he will select a sequence of kids such that the length of the sequence is maximized, meanwhile satisfying the above condition   Input First line is an integer T which denotes the total number of test cases. Each of the next T lines contains an integer N which denotes, N students. The next line contains N spaced integers.where it denotes the order in which the kids arranged themselves.  Output Each line contains an integer which denotes the maximum number of students among the N students who have arranged themselves according the rule said by Watson.It is guaranteed that Holmes will select atleast 1 or 2 students  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ Each of next N integers ≤ 10^9   Example Input: 2 5 2 3 5 1 2 3 1 2 3  Output: 3 3    Explanation Example case 1. Here the first kid has 2 chocolates, second has 3 chocolates, third kid has 5 chocolates, which is the sum of first kid's total chocolates and second kid's chocolate. Forth student has only 1 chocolate where he did not follow the rule. So the maximum number of kids who arranged themselves in the order was 3. That is students at index 1 to index 3. 
After the huge success of Mangalyaan this year, the ISRO (Indian Space Research Organization) is planning to launch a manned mission to Mars named Mangalyaan-2, in 2015. They obviously would want to select the best astronauts for this space mission. ISRO's research team has examined N available astronauts and computed a fitness score for each of them. It has been decided that astronauts with fitness score greater than or equal to a threshold score P, are eligible for the mission. Can you report the number of eligible astronauts?  Input The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then for each test case, the first line contains two space separated integers N and P denoting number of astronauts and the threshold score respectively. The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the fitness scores of the astronauts. Note: All fitness scores are distinct and are given in descending order.  Output For each test case, output the number of astronauts eligible for the mission on a separate line.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ N ≤ 100 1 ≤ P ≤ 1000 1 ≤ Ai ≤ 1000   Example Input: 3 3 10 7 3 1 3 5 7 3 1 3 1 7 3 1  Output: 0 1 3   Explanation In the first case, no astronauts are selected as none of them have fitness score greater than or equal to 10. In the second case, the astronaut with score 7 is selected. In the third case, all astronauts are selected. 
ISRO has shot to global fame after Mangalyaan. They have decided to build hi-tech ground stations throughout the country which can be used either as a control station or as a launch station (but not as both simultaneously). A control station is one which has all controls to the rocket. A launch station is the site from where a rocket is launched. For a successful launch, ISRO has identified that they need 2 control stations and that these 2 control stations should be equidistant from the launch station. Initially there is only one ground station having index 0, where the headquarters of ISRO is located. Over a period of time, they plan to build more and more ground stations. They can perform two kinds of operations (for given V):    Type 0: Build a new ground station and construct a one-way road from the ground station having index V to the newly built ground station. In other words, if the index of the newly built ground station is W, then a one way road V->W having length = 1 is constructed. The index of the new ground station will be the smallest positive integer which is not the index of any existing ground station. (Of course, this also helps them to keep track of the number of ground stations they have built so far.)    Type 1: Given a ground station with index V, count how many unordered pairs (P, Q) of ground stations exist such that the ground stations P and Q are both reachable from V (paths from V to P and V to Q exist),  and there exists a ground station R (need not be reachable from V), such that distance(P, R) = distance(Q, R), R ≠ P, R ≠ Q and P ≠ Q. Of course, ISRO wants to know this information beforehand since such pairs (P, Q) are possible candidates for control stations, and R is a possible candidate for the launch station.     Adding more explanation "Given a ground station with index V, count how many unordered pairs (P, Q) of ground stations exist such that the ground stations P and Q are both reachable from V (paths from V to P and V to Q exist), and there exists a ground station R (need not be reachable from V), such that distance(P,R) = distance(Q, R), R ≠ P, R ≠ Q and P ≠ Q."  As this says, there need not be path from R->P or P->R. How ever please use the following as definition of distance.  Distance(X, Y) = Number of roads in the unique path from X to Y, if the given road network were bi-directional.  Please note that, V->P and V->Q should still exist in directed road network.   Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer M denoting the number of operations. Each of the next M lines contain 2 integers -  type and V. if type = 0, then perform type 0 operation (for given V). if type = 1, then perform type 1 operation (for given V).  Output For each test case, for each query of type 1, you must print the answer to the query on a separate line.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 5 1 ≤ M ≤ 100000 0 ≤ type ≤ 1 For both type of operations 0 & 1, the given ground station V would have already been built.   Example Input: 2 4 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 6 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 2 1 1  Output: 0 1 1 2   Explanation Example case 1: First operation is of type 1. There is only 1 ground station (with index 0), so number of pairs are 0. Second operation is of type 0. A new ground station with index 1 is built, and a road from 0->1 (having length 1) is added. Third operation is of type 0 again. A new ground station with index 2 is built, and a road from 1->2 (having length 1) is added. Fourth operation is of type 1. There are 3 ground stations now. (0, 2) is the only valid pair as there exists ground station 1 with distance(2, 1) = distance(0, 1) = 1, and both the stations 0 & 2 are reachable from 0. Example case 2: There are 2 operations of type 1. For the first one, (0, 2) is the only valid pair, and for the second one, there are 2 valid pairs pairs - (2, 3) and (1, 4). 
"The Mars Orbiter Mission probe lifted-off from the First Launch Pad at Satish Dhawan Space Centre (Sriharikota Range SHAR), Andhra Pradesh, using a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) rocket C25 at 09:08 UTC (14:38 IST) on 5 November 2013". The secret behind this successful launch was the launch pad that ISRO used. An important part of the launch pad is the launch tower. It is the long vertical structure which supports the rocket. ISRO now wants to build a better launch pad for their next mission. For this, ISRO has acquired a long steel bar, and the launch tower can be made by cutting a segment from the bar. As part of saving the cost, the bar they have acquired is not homogeneous. The bar is made up of several blocks, where the i^th block has durability S[i], which is a number between 0 and 9. A segment is defined as any contiguous group of one or more blocks. If they cut out a segment of the bar from i^th block to j^th block (i<=j), then the durability of the resultant segment is given by ( S[i]*10^(j-i) + S[i+1]*10^(j-i-1) + S[i+2]*10^(j-i-2) + … + S[j] * 10^(0) ) % M. In other words, if W(i,j) is the base-10 number formed by concatenating the digits S[i], S[i+1], S[i+2], …, S[j], then the durability of the segment (i,j) is W(i,j) % M. For technical reasons that ISRO will not disclose, the durability of the segment used for building the launch tower should be exactly L. Given S and M, find the number of ways ISRO can cut out a segment from the steel bar whose durability is L.  Input The first line contains a string S. The i^th character of this string represents the durability of i^th segment. The next line contains a single integer Q, denoting the number of queries. Each of the next Q lines contain two space separated integers, denoting M and L.  Output For each query, output the number of ways of cutting the bar on a separate line.  Constraints  1 ≤ |S| ≤ 2 * 10^4 Q ≤ 5 0 < M < 500 0 ≤ L < M   Example Input: 23128765 3 7 2 9 3 15 5  Output: 9 4 5   Explanation For M=9, L=3, the substrings whose remainder is 3 when divided by 9 are: 3, 31287, 12 and 876. 
ISRO is planning to build a landing platform on MARS as a part of MOM. It has selected a small 2-D rectangular region for the same, and every point in the region has a strength associated with it. The landing platform should be in the form of a cross (see definition below for more details) and as strong as possible. The selected 2-D rectangular region has M * N points represented by (x, y), for all 0 <= x < M, 0 <= y < N. Let W[i][j] denote the strength of the point (i, j). We define a cross as follows:    It consists of 2 line segments of equal length. The end points of the line segments should coincide with any of the given M * N points.   Each of the line segments are at an angle of 45° with both the X & Y axis.   Both the line segments intersect exactly at one point, and their centres coincide. (i.e) if the 2 line segments are represented by { (x11, y11), (x12, y12) }, { (x21, y21), (x22, y22)  }, then (x11+x12) / 2 = (x21+x22) / 2 and (y11+y12) / 2 = (y21+y22) / 2. The point where the 2 line segments intersect is called the center of the cross.   Each line segment of the cross should have a non-zero length. Hence, a single point cannot be considered as a cross.    The strength of a cross is defined as the sum of strengths of all points that lie on it. Your task is to find the cross with maximum strength, which ISRO would like to use as the landing platform.  Input The first line contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then for each test case, the first line contains two integers M and N. Each of the following M lines, contain N space separated integers, where the j^th integer on the i^th line denotes W[i-1][j-1], for all 1 <= i <= M, 1 <= j <= N.  Output For each test case, output a single integer denoting the strength of the maximum-strength cross, on a separate line  Constraints  T ≤ 100 2 ≤ M ≤ 100 2 ≤ N ≤ 100 -10^6 ≤ W[i][j] ≤ 10^6   Example Input: 2 3 3 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 2 3 0 1 -2 2 3 1  Output: -1 6    Explanation In the first case, the cross formed by the line segments {(0, 0), (2, 2)} and {(0, 2), (2, 0)} has the maximum strength = 1+(-1)+1+(-1)+(-1) = -1. Note: You cannot choose a cross with 0 strength (not passing through any of the given points) here, because it is given that each line segment of the cross should pass through atleast one of the given points In the second case, the cross formed by the line segments {(0, 0), (1, 1)} and {(0, 1), (1, 0)} has the maximum strength = 0+3+1+2 = 6 
The ISRO (Indian Space Research Organization) has recently built a supercomputer with the help of C-DAC (Center for Development of Advanced Computing), for processing data generated from MOM (Mars Orbiter Mission). Before using it for real data, they want to test it out with the following problem, as they feel it is very hard for a normal computer to solve this problem. Given a number N, find the sum of f(x) for all x such that 1 <= x <= N. f(x) is defined as the sum of all digits in base 10 representation of the number x. For example, f(121) = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4. As the number N is very big, it is given in the following run length encoded format - N is represented as a sequence of M blocks, where each block i (0 <= i < M) is represented by two integers - (len[i], d[i]). This implies that the digit d[i] occurs len[i] number of times. For example, {(2,1), (1,2), (2,9)} represents the number 11299. Can you help them by writing a solution to validate the supercomputer's output? Note: There will be no leading zeros in the given number.  Input The first line contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer M. Each of the following M lines contain 2 space separated integers, where the i^th line describes the i^th block with length len[i] and digit d[i] respectively.  Output For each test case, print the result modulo 1000000007 on a separate line.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 25 1 ≤ M ≤ 10000 d[0] > 0 0 ≤ d[i] ≤ 9 1 ≤ len[i] ≤ 10^18 1 ≤ Total length of N ≤ 10^18   Example Input: 2 1 1 5 2 1 1 1 0  Output: 15 46    Explanation For case 1, the N is 5 and the result is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15. For case 2, the N is 10 and the result is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + (1 + 0) = 46. 
Laxman is doing Diwali shopping. There are N shops numbered from 1 to N. Laxman wants to buy M different types of crackers. Crackers are numbered from 1 to M. Each shop sells many types of crackers. Laxman is currently at the i'th shop. Laxman want to find j and k, such that j <= i and k ≥ i and he can buy all M types of crackers only by visiting shops in the range of j to k. If there are multiple valid j, k, he then want to minimize the window size, that is, minimize the value of k - j. If there are still multiple valid j, k, then he wants to minimize the value of j. It is also known that, by visiting all the N shops, Laxman can surely buy all M types of crackers. Write a program to output j, k values for all valid i.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each test case is described as follows, First line of each test case has 2 integers, N and M. Following N lines describe the shops. Each of the N lines starts with an integer X, which denotes the number of different types of crackers sold in that shop. X integers follow describing the cracker types. All the X integers are different.  Output For each test case output N lines, One for each i, 1 <= i <= N. Each line should contain two integers, j and k.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10000 1 ≤ N ≤ 100000 1 ≤ M ≤ 100000 0 ≤ X ≤ 100000 1 ≤ Sum of N over all test cases ≤ 500000 1 ≤ Sum of M over all test cases ≤ 500000 1 ≤ Sum of X over all test cases ≤ 500000   Example Input: 2 3 3 1 1 1 2 1 3 3 3 1 1 2 2 3 1 1  Output: 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 2 1 2 2 3  Explanation Test case #1: Laxman needs to visit all 3 shops to but all M types  Test case #2: Laxman needs to visit shops 1, 2 to get all M types. Or he can visit shops 2, 3 to get all M types. For i = 2, we could have bought all types from shops 2 3, but we prefer 1 2 because 1 < 2, as stated in the statement we want to minimize j in case of tie.  
Ram has N different crackers. These crackers are very special, each of them can fire infinite number of fire-balls. Ram made an arrangement with those N crackers. If the spark is currently with the i'th cracker, it will first fire a fire-ball, and then it will pass the spark to the (i+1)'th cracker. Note that the N'th cracker will pass spark to the 1'st cracker. Ram initially placed the spark at the a'th cracker. However the spark will get exhausted after M passes, that is, it gets off during M+1'th pass. Ram want to know which cracker will fire the last fire-ball before spark goes off. Write a program to print this answer.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Following T lines describe the test cases, one per line. Each line contains 3 integers, N, a and M.  Output For each test case output one line, which contains the required answer.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 1000 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000 0 ≤ M ≤ 1000 1 ≤ a ≤ N   Example Input: 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 5 1 19  Output: 4 1 5  Explanation Test case #1: Spark is initially at the 1'st cracker. It fires a fire-ball and passes spark to the 2'nd cracker. The 2'nd cracker fires a fire-ball and passes the spark to the 3'rd cracker. The 3rd cracker fires a fire-ball and passes spark to the 4th cracker. The 4th cracker fires a fire-ball and passes the spark to the 5'th cracker, however, we already made 3 passes and this is 4th pass, so spark gets off. The last cracker to fire a fire-ball is the 4'th cracker.  Test case #2: Spark is initially at the 1'st cracker. It fires a fire-ball and passes spark to the 2'nd cracker. After the 4'th pass, the spark is with the 5'th cracker. The 5'th cracker fires a fire-ball and passes it to the 1'st cracker (Read the statement carefully, the N'th cracker passes spark to the 1'st cracker). The 1'st cracker fires the fire-ball and passes to the 2'nd cracker, spark gets exhausted during this pass. So the last cracker to fire was the 1'st.  
Sita went to buy some crackers. They offered special discount for the ones who solve a puzzle. Sita could not solve it, she came to you for help. Following is the puzzle. A mapping "a->b" means that you can transform letter 'a' to letter 'b'. You are given M such mappings. You are given two strings S and T. Write a program which determines if S can be transformed to T using the provided mappings. You can select any position in S and apply any of the M mappings on it. You can do this any number of times. Each mapping can be used any number of times.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer P denoting the number of test cases. First line of each test case has the string S. Second line of each test case has the string T Third line of each test case has M. Following M lines describes the mappings, one per line.  Output For each test case output one line, print "YES" if it is possible to transfrom S to T. print "NO" if not possible.  Constraints  1 ≤ P ≤ 1000 1 ≤ |S|, |T| ≤ 1000 0 ≤ M ≤ 1000 S and T contain lower case English alphabet only All mappings are from lower case English alphabet to lower case English alphabet Length of S and T need not be equal.   Example Input: 3 aa bb 1 a->b ab ba 2 a->b b->a a b 1 b->a Output: YES YES NO  Explanation Test case #1: Clearly 'a' can be transformed to 'b'. So "aa" can be transformed to "bb"  Test case #2: 'a' can be transformed to 'b' by using mapping 1. 'b' can be transformed to 'a' by using mapping 2 Test case #3: 'b' can be transformed to 'a' but 'a' cannot be transformed to 'b'. So it is not possible. 
Hanuman was the army chief in the war against ravana, he helped Ram. Well, everyone knew about that, but did you know that Hanuman also helped people of byteland? Let me tell you the story!! Long long ago, on the day of diwali, people were unhappy with the crackers they had. They wanted to do some swaps with others and get the crackers they like, but they had lot of fights due to lack of rules. They all went to lord Hanuman for help, Hanuman asked them to follow few rules for peace. Firstly, Hanuman did the following,  1) Hanuman, numbered all the people starting from 1. There are N people in all. 2) Lord also numbered the crackers in order starting from 1. There are N*5 crackers. 3) He gave each of them 3 crackers to start with. Person numbered i, got crackers (3*i)-2, (3*i)-1, 3*i. 4) Hanuman kept rest of the crackers with him.   Following are the rules given, 1) Each person gets his chance to ask for swap of crackers. This starts with person numbered 1, then 2, 3, 4 ... and ends with person numbered N. Any person, in his turn, can request for 3 swaps at the most. Note that they can also request for swap for crackers that are with Hanuman. 2) When a person asks for a swap, the other person should obey it and allow the swap.   Note that, after the process described above, each person will get 3 crackers. Having said that, Hanuman told the people to start the process. Let me also tell you about what the people prefer (In that order) 1) They always want their crackers numbered in order. (Example : 1, 2, 3 or 12,11,10 but not 10, 11, 13) 2) Each person has a preference number P[i], they want their least-numbered cracker to be ≥ P[i] and as least as possible. 3) If he could not get set of crackers satisfying condition 1 and 2, he will then try to get his least-numbered cracker to be as least as possible (Leaving about ≥ P[i] condition) Note:  No person will ever break 1st condition. He will always try and get 3 ordered crackers. After that, they will try to follow 2nd condition, and if that is not possible then they move to the 3rd condition.   All N people are smart. They all make optimal choice. They all also know that others will always make optimal choice. Every person also knows about every other persons preference number (P[ ]). Your task is to write a program, given N and P[ ], output the least-numbered cracker each person will end up with when everyone make optimal choice of swaps.   Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each test case is as follows, First line of each test case has one integer, N. Second line of each test case contains N integers representing the array P[ ]  Output For each test case output one line with N integers, i'th integer being the least-numbered cracker received by i'th person  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10000 1 ≤ N ≤ 100000 1 ≤ P[i] ≤ N*5 1 ≤ Sum of N over all test cases ≤ 500000   Example Input: 2 2 1 5 2 4 9  Output: 1 5 4 1  Explanation Test case #1: First person does not make any swaps. He is happy with the crackers he has (1, 2, 3). Second person swaps cracker-4 with cracker-7 to get the crackers (5, 6, 7). This is to follow 2nd condition.  Test case #2: First person makes 3 swaps (1<->4, 2<->5, 3<->6). At this moment, first person has (4, 5, 6) and the second person has (1, 2, 3) In this case, second person preference number is 9. But there are only 10 crackers, so he cannot get (9, 10, 11), it is impossible to follow condition 1 and 2, for that reason he decided to follow 1st and 3rd condition. Which means he want to minimize his least-numbered cracker. Second person will not request for any swaps as he already has (1, 2, 3)  
Ram brought home N identical crackers, and arranged them in a row. He then numbered all the crackers with positive integer numbers such that product of any two numbers is less than or equal to K. He also ensured that the numbers read from left most cracker to right most cracker are in non-decreasing order. Ravana took away all the crackers when Ram was not at home. To keep things simple, Cool dude Laxman brought N new identical crackers. Now he want to number them following the conditions Ram followed, but he realized that there are multiple ways to do it. Given N and K, write a program to output the number of ways to number the crackers. If there are infinite ways to do it, output "-1" instead.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Only line of each testcase contains two integer numbers N and K.  Output For each test case output one line. If the number of ways is infinite print "-1". If the number of ways is finite, print the required answer modulo 1000000007.  Constraints  1 ≤ T, N, K ≤ 100000   Example Input: 2 2 1 2 2 Output: 1 2  Explanation Test case #1: We need to number 2 crackers. And the product of any two numbers should not exceed 1. The only possible numbering is "1 1"  Test case #2: In this case the product of any two numbers should not exceed 2. Two possible ways are "1 1" and "1 2". Note that "2 1" is invalid because Ram ensured that the numbering from left to right is non-decreasing.  
 Like all other teams, the LaZyProblemSetters (consisting of V, J and S) are also participating in ICPC with high hopes for qualifying for the world finals. They would like to go to the world finals to represent their country and bring back a medal. However, first they have to clear the prelims contest. For that, they have decided to have a practice round before the prelims. They are going to have the practice round from time S to E. However, the team members are not so sure whether they would be able to participate in the practice contest for the whole duration as they already have some previous reservations. To solve that, they have created a list of all the things everyone is supposed to do or reservations they have to fulfil.  The list they prepared has a total of N tasks. They have also noted down the time in which each task needs to be done, i.e. the start time and the end time. During that time, at least one of the team members is busy doing that task and would be unavailable for the ICPC pre-prelims practice contest.   You are given the time slot LaZyProblemSetters have decided to practice together and the list of tasks with their start and end time that they prepared. Print whether they all would be able to practice together for the full duration of the contest. For this problem, you can assume that if V, J or S ends a task at time T1, he can give his undivided attention to the contest starting from T1 itself and if the contest ends at time T2, they can get back to their reserved tasks at T2 itself.   Input The first line of the input contains an integer T, the number of test cases in a file. Then T test cases follow each of which has the following structure: The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers S and E. The second line of each test case contains N. Then N lines follow each of which contains two space separated integers, xi and yi, the start and the end time of the i^th task.  Output For each test case, print "YES" (without quotes) if the team members can practice together for the full duration of the pre-prelims contest, print "NO" (without quotes) otherwise in a new line.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 3 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ S < E  ≤  10^18 1 ≤ xi < yi ≤  10^18   Example Input: 1 10 20 3 1 10 21 50 30 33  Output: YES   
As we all know that team LaZyProblemSetters with participants V, J and K is gearing up for ICPC 2015, and have decided to solve a problem set to practice for the prelims round. The day of that practice round has now arrived and they are very eager to get started. They have picked up an ordered set of N problems to solve. Now, since they are newbies in the field of programming, they have chosen problems which are not so tough. Hence, every problem that they have taken is solvable by all the three members.   To make it feel like the regional contest, they have decided to use only a single computer system.Since they are newbies, instead of optimizing on time and resources they have come up with the following plan to decide on how they would attempt to solve the problems.    They have divided their total time in N time slots.  In the i^th time slot, they will code up the i^th problem. Since they are easy problems, it is known that each problem would be solved within the given time slot.  In each time slot, the computer will be allotted to either V, J or K. They will not share the computer with anyone else in the time slot allocated to them.   Now all that is left is to decide who will solve which problem on the computer. To make things easier, all of them have listed their requirements on how the distribution of the problems should be.   K being a lover of the number k has decided that the total number of problems coded by him will be a multiple of k. J being a busy guy decided to never code problems in consecutive slots. In the gaps between his slots, he has some other work that he wants to finish. V being a relatively new coder, wants to code at least one problem from the whole set.   Your task is to find out the number of ways in which they can distribute the problems amongst themselves.   Input First line of the input will contain an integer T, the number of test cases to follow. Next T lines follow. Each line will represent a test case containing two space separated integers N and k.   Output For each input, print the number of ways in which V, J and K can distribute the problems amongst themselves in a new line. Since, it can be a very large number, output it modulo 10000007.  Constraints  0 ≤ k ≤ 10 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^18 The constraint on T can be computed from below.   Test Data Generation The value of T in an input file is determined by the following rule: For an input file, we keep an integer variable total (initialized to 0). For each test case in the input file, we take the value of k in the test case and update total as follows:    if k > 0, total = total + k  if k == 0, total = total + 1  Now, it is guaranteed that for each input file, the value of total as computed above will never exceed 500.   Example Input: 3 2 0 2 1 3 1  Output: 3 5 17 
 Finally the LazyProblemSetters have decided the way in which they will attempt the questions in the problem set. They have decided to go to the Computer Lab of the CSE department (because it has air-conditioning) and are ready to get their hands dirty with some WA's and TLE's.   Their department has a very unique lab. They have a lot of computers and each student gets a private account which they can access through any of those computers. For this, no data is stored on these computers but on dedicated servers and sent to the computer that a student is currently using. This way the students are not forced to sit on particular computers and can choose any place they like that is available.   Now, the department has a home built advanced facial recognition software which they use in this lab. It works as follows:When anyone sits on a computer, his/her picture is captured, (along with the locality) and sent to the internal database of the lab where they identify the user associated with that picture, and the computer he/she is sitting. After that the data of that user is fetched from the dedicated data servers and sent to the computer.   Now, all this takes time, and to keep the user busy, they decided to give them a puzzle to solve. If the user solves the puzzle correctly, they are allowed to login. The puzzle is as follows:    A string S (composed of only small case letters of the English alphabet) is shown on the screen to the user.  Then two integers P and Q are shown to the users.  The user has now to create a string R using S and P by concatenating P copies of S one after another. Then R is transformed into its smallest lexicographic permutation i.e. all the "a"'s are brought to the front and placed there, then after that all the "b"'s are placed, then "c"'s and so on. This is the final R that the user needs to form.  Then Q numbers appear on the screen one by one. For each number N that appears on the screen, the user has to type the character at the N^th location of R. If N is greater than the length of R, they have to type "-1" (without quotes).   Input The first line consists of an integer T, the number of test cases followed by the test cases themselves. Each test case begins with the string S in the first line, followed by two space-separated integers P and Q in the next line. Then Q lines follow, each containing an integer N.   Output For each test case, for each integer N, print in a new line the character at the N^th location of R  or print "-1" (without quotes) as described above.  Constraints   1 ≤ P ≤ 10^7  1 ≤ N ≤ 10^9  1 ≤ Q ≤ 10^5  1 ≤ |S| ≤ 100, where |S| denotes the length of the string.  1 ≤ T ≤ 10   Example  Input: 1 abcde 3 5 3 4 10 15 16  Output: a b d e -1  Note: Large I/O, be careful with certain languages 
As we all know that team LaZyProblemSetters is gearing up for ICPC 2015 and have finally reached in front of a computer together to solve a problem set. Since they have already wasted too much time procrastinating, they have decided to manage the problem set with more caution. They are now ordering the problems according to their difficulty levels instead of solving all the easy problems as they used to do earlier.   For this practice round, everybody has pitched in a few problems of their choice. So in the end, they have a set of N problems ordered as P1, ..., PN, where Pi denotes the i^th problem. For each problem that was brought in by any team member, he assigned an integer Di which according to him is the difficulty level of that problem.   The difficulty level assigned to a problem is exactly the number of time units one expects to solve that particular problem. However, as we all know, that assigning difficulty to a problem is really subjective and the assigned difficulty level of the problem may change when all the three team members look at that problem.

    Problem description. Abhishek is taking a girl from his office to a date but he lacks money. Unfortunately this is not the first time something like this has happened, and reason is obvious - Abhishek goes out on way too many dates. He makes up his mind to solve this problem just before the date starts and he starts planning for it. He wants a limit for the total expense on any date and tries to have the most possible fun with regard to this limit. Abhishek know beforehand the cost of each item on the menu and makes an estimate of how much his date would enjoy ordering each item. Write a program which finds the optimal set of menu items that offer the most enjoyment to Abhishek's date. Maximize their enjoyment, without crossing the budget. Needless to say but he wants to save money for other dates as well, so he wants to spend only the amount actually required and save as much as he can. Abhishek is lucky as he can always choose the menu items to order.  Input:  The first line of the input specifies your date budget and the number N of items on menu. The following N lines contain two numbers each. The first number indicates the cost of each item. Items cost between $5 and $25. The second number indicates the amount of enjoyment given by each item, given as an integer number ranging from 1 to 10(both inclusive). The budget will not exceed $500 and there will be at most 100 items. All numbers are separated by a single space. There are many test cases. Input ends with 0 0.   Output For each test case your program must output the total cost of all the items and the total enjoyment of an optimal solution. Both numbers must be separated by a single space.

 Problem description.  Dr. Aditi in The Department of Biological Sciences in BITS Pilani decides to do an experiment and find what mutation in the genes of mice can help reduce their speed of food consumption and also the gene responsible for the growth rate of mice. Since she is a genius she successfully finds the gene responsible for it. Now she has a task to create a mutation so as to decrease the food consumption rate. She creates one mutation each in various identical genes and needs to have various trials to find which mutations works. She now implants a single mutant gene in each mice. For conducting trials, she uses cupcakes that will determine the food consumption rates. If there are N types of mutations, what is the minimum number of cupcakes required to find the mutation that works correctly? Assume that all other mutations except one are useless and all mice except one eat cupcakes with the same speed and there is at least one mutation that will be successful. The same cupcake cannot be used more than once.  Input The first line contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The next T lines contains one integer N, the total number of mutations.  Output For each test case, output a single integer containing minimum number of cupcakes required.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤  100 1 ≤ N ≤  10^5   Example Input: 3 2 6 12  Output: 2 4 5    Explanation Example case 1. If there are 2 mutations, 1 in each mice, then both of them can be given a cupcake and the mice which eats less will be the correct mutation. Example case 2. If there are 6 mutations, then divide 6 mice in two groups of 3. Give each group a cupcake. The group which eats less cupcake i.e finishes later contains the mutant mice. Let's assume "abc" is that group. Now you will require only 2 more cupcakes to find the mutant mice. So total number of cupcakes required are 4. 
  Problem description. Little Schrodinger had a magical cat. That cat once fell down an empty well. As the walls of the well were not completely vertical, the cat could climb up the well. In one day, the cat can climb 1 unit height and the height of the well is h units. The cat starts at the bottom. Every day, a cat would divide into 2 cats. One of them would climb up 1 unit. The other would wait for help. But while waiting it would fall asleep and roll down 1 unit, unless it is already at the bottom, in which case it just remains there. When a cat would reach the top, it would run home to Schrodinger. (Schrodinger doesn't know that some of the cats are in a well and so he can't rescue them). It has been d days since the cat fell into the well. How many cats would come out of the well today? You would notice that the number of cats grows very large with each passing day, so output the answer modulo 10^9+7. NOTE : d = 0 means that the cat has fallen just now and so there's just one cat at the bottom of the well. So you wouldn't see any cat coming out today. If the height of the well is 1 unit, you will see a cat come out tomorrow.  Input The first line contains the number of test cases T. Each line of a test case contains the 2 integers h and d.  Output For each test case output the number of cats reaching Schrodinger modulo (10^9+7).  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤  1000 1 ≤ h ≤  10 0 ≤ d ≤  10^18     Example Input: 4 4 0 4 3 5 5 5 7  Output: 0 0 1 5

  It's not the rivers that you might be thinking about. The question revolves around the concept of digital rivers. A digital river is a sequence of numbers where the number following n is n plus the sum of its digits. FOR EXAMPLE  12345 is followed by 12360 since 1+2+3+4+5=15 and so   12345 + 15 gives 12360. similarly 145 is followed by 155.    If the unit's digit of a digital river is 'M' we will call it river 'M' .for example 231 would be called river 1.  river 480 is the sequence beginning {480,492,507,519....} river 483 is the sequence beginning   {483,498,519,....}.    normal streams and rivers can meet, and the same is true for digital rivers . This happens when two digital rivers share some of the same values. FOR EXAMPLE:  river 480 meets river 483 at 519. river 480 meets river 507 at 507 and never meets river 481.    Every digital river will eventually meet river 1,river 3 or river 9.   Write a program that can determine for a given integer n the value where river n first meets one of these three rivers.  Input   The input may contain multiple test cases. Each test case occupies a separate line and contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 16384). A test case with value of 0 for n terminates the input and this test case must not be processed.  Output  For each test case in the input first output the test case number(starting from 1)as shown in the sample output. Then on a separate line output the line "first meets river x at y".Here y is the lowest value where river n first meets river x (x= 1 or 3 or 9).If river n meets river x at y for more than one value of x,output the lowest value.print a blank line between two consecutive test cases.    Input:   86   12345   0    Output:   Case #1   first meets river 1 at 101    Case #2   first meets river 3 at 12423

Then, he moves to a square in the next row, collects the flowers, and so on until he reaches the last row. He can not go back to a previous row When he moves to the next row, he can only move to the square just below it or diagonally to the left or right. Help Romeo grab the maximum number of roses he can.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follow: The first line of each test case contains two integers H and W denoting the number of rows and columns respectively. H lines follow. Each line has W space separated integers A1, A2, ..., AW, where each integer M is the number of flowers in that square.  Output Output T lines, one for each test case. Each line should contain a single integer, which is the maximum possible number of flowers Romeo can get, for the corresponding test case.

 Romeo and Juliet are sending messages to each other. But to protect them from prying eyes, they have come up with a clever scheme to encrypt their messages. They have assigned a number to every possible combination of alphabets! It goes as follows: 1 = A 2 = B . . . 26 = Z 27 = AA 28 = AB . . . 702 = ZZ 703 = AAA and so on. Now you have to decrypt their message.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follow: Each test case contains a single integer N denoting the coded word.  Output For each test case, output a single string(upper case) which is the decoded word.  Constraints Should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have. Format it like:  1 <= T <= 1000 1 <= N <= 10^18   Example Input: 5 6 28 221629 4606000382677 62977  Output: F AB LOVE VALENTINE CODE  Problem Setter: Rohan Rawat 
  We all know that girls love gifts, right? Well, if you have been into programming, you must be knowing about Alice and Bob. Alice and Bob have been dating since a while and so it's very natural that they'll meet over a cup of coffee today, i.e. the Valentine's Day :D Bob is very confused as to what should he gift Alice today. He doesn't believe in giving expensive gifts (just like me :P), so he decides to give a custom selection of some fine dark chocolates which he plans to get gift wrapped along with a red rose. Sounds great!! :) A small problem has cropped up though. The problem is, when he visits the chocolate shop, the shopkeeper shows him many small dark chocolates placed in a M X N box. Bob is having a hard time figuring out the different types of chocolates available in the box because the shopkeeper doesn't have the exact information about their flavors. Though he can distinguish them on the basis of their shape, their flavors are not known to him because similarly shaped chocolates may have the same or different flavor. However, the shopkeeper does have some information in a weird format. He says that the chocolates which share an edge (which means they are adjacent to each other) have the same flavor. This implies that the box can have empty cells as well. Bob is curious as to how many different combinations of chocolates he can gift to Alice categorized on the basis of their flavors (and not shape)? Note: Two combinations are different from each other if there is at least one chocolate in one of the combinations which has a flavor which is not present in any of the chocolates in the other. See examples for better understanding.   Input The first line of the input consists of T, the no of test cases. The first line of each test case consists of two space separated integers M and N denoting the dimensions of the chocolate box. The next M lines consist of N characters denoting the contents of the cell: 'C' standing for a chocolate and 'E' standing for an an empty cell.    Output For each test case, output on a new line the total no of different combinations possible modulo 1000000007.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 1000 1 ≤ N, M ≤ 100     Example Input: 2 3 3 CEE ECE EEC 1 2 CC  Output: 7 1    Explanation Example case 1.There are three chocolates and all of these have different flavors. So, a total of 7 combinations are possible. Let the three chocolates be 1, 2 and 3 respectively.  Then the 7 combinations are (1), (2), (3), (1, 2), (1,3), (2, 3) and (1, 2, 3). Example case 2.Here both the chocolates have the same flavor. Hence, answer is 1 since only a single flavor is available. Problem Setter: Ayush Jaggi

Chef has gone out camping. One day while coming back to his tent he lost his way. While searching for the way back he encountered THREE SUPERNATURAL RIVERS,out of which only one can take him back to his tent. Each river has rocks besides it with numbers on it starting from 1,3 and 9 respectively. The next rock in the series has number as the previous number plus the sum of digits of previous number. eg for river with rock no. 1 as first rock the series will be: 1,1+1=2,2+2=4,4+4=8,8+8=16,16+1+6=23,23+2+3=28,... or 1,2,4,8,16,23,28,38,49..... or for river with rock no 3 as first rock: 3,3+3=6,6+6=12,12+1+2=15,15+1+5=21,21+2+1=24,24+2+4=30.... or 3,6,12,15,21,24,30,33,39,51... or the series for 29 will be: 29,29+2+9=40,40+4+0=44,44+4+4=52,52+5+2=59,59+5+9=73..... or 29,40,44,52,59,73.....  Chef also has a number in his mind. This number will help him to determine that which river he has to cross and from which rock. He has to cross at the roch number of the specific river where both the series of river and the series of the number he has thought have a number in common. eg. if has thought of the number 29, then he would have to cross river 1 at rock number 107.

Will, Elizabeth, Barbossa, and the entire crew of Black Pearl are set out to rescue Captain Jack Sparrow from Davy Jones's Locker. The escape map is a graph with N islands and M routes. Each route represents a bi-directional way from one island to another. The N islands are numbered from 1 to N. With each route associated is end-points (Ai,Bi) and the length of the route Ci. Since Davy Jones have left some of his servants at each island, there is some danger level associated with each island Dj. The crew wants to escape out of the locker of davy jones alive. They need to go from Davy Jone's island to their home following the given routes. As a matter of fact, their ship Black Pearl have only K units of fuel left in it. Black Pearl travels 1 unit with 1 unit of fuel. You need to tell Jack the minimum danger level with which the crew can escape to determine their chances of survival. If it is impossible to escape, the entire crew is doomed and you should print -1. The danger level of a path is defined as the maximum of danger level out of all the nodes present in that particular path.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case would contain two integers, N and K. The following line would contain N integers separated by a single space representing Dj, the danger level of each island. The next line would contain three integers, M, X and Y, representing the number of edges, Davy Jones island and Jack's home respectively.

Jack and Angelica are in search of fountain of youth and up ahead is the valley of death. Although they could go around the valley, Blackbeard wants to get the chalices before the Spanish so he forces one of them to go through the valley. To decide who would travel through the valley, Jack and Angelica play a game of stones. The game starts with P piles of stones. The i^th pile contains Ni number of stones. The players play the game taking chances alternatively where Jack starts first. In each move, the player whose turn it is has to remove at least one coin from any single pile and ofcourse not more than the number of coins present in that particular pile. The number of coins which can be removed in one move is defined as a special series for each pile by the Blackbeard. Only the numbers that appear anywhere in the special series of that pile can be removed in one move from that pile. The special series is: F[i] = F[i-1] + F[i-2], for i ≥ 2 F[0] = 1 and F[1] = Mi , where Mi is given for each pile Stating simply, only those number of coins can be removed from a pile if it satisfies F[i] for any i ≥ 0 for the special series of that pile. The player who cannot make a move loses and is forced to jump into the valley of death. You need to tell who would survive if they both always play optimally.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains one integer, P. The next P lines contain two integers, Ni and Mi denoting the number of stones and F[1] of the special series of that pile respectively.  Output For each test case, print "Jack" if Jack wins else print "Angelica".  Constraints:  1 <= T <= 10 1 <= P <= 100 1 <= Ni <= 10000 1 <= Mi <= 10000   Example Input 2 2 4 3 5 2 2 5 3 5 3 Output Jack Angelica  Explanation  In the first test case, the players can remove either 1,3,4.. and so on from pile one and either 1,2,3.. from pile two. If now both play optimally, Jack wins. 
Barbossa after a long search has found the island on which the dead man's chest is located. To open the chest, Barbossa has to solve the mystery of the chest. Barbossa knowing the only programmer you, needs your help to solve the mystery. You are given N distinct digits and a string S. A number is mysterious if it contains all the N given digits atleast once and other digits may or may not come. Leading zeroes are never considered. The mysterious number also must not have the given string S as a substring of the number.  For example, If 1, 2 and 3 are the digits given and 23 is the string given, then 12 is not a mysterious number since it does not have 3 in it, 123 is not a valid mysterious number since 23 is a substring of the number, whereas 132 and 11324 are mysterious numbers. You need to solve the mystery by calculating the total number of mysterious numbers between [L,R] and the sum of all the mysterious numbers between [L,R] for some queries of L and R.  Input: The first line of the input contains an integer N denoting the number of digits. The description of N distinct digits follows in the next line as space separated integers. The third line contains the string S. The next line contains only one integer Q denoting the number of queries. The following Q lines denote each query containing two integers L and R.  Output: For each query, print in the format "A B" where A is the total number of mysterious numbers mod 100003 in the range and B is the sum of all the lucky numbers mod 100003 in the range.  Constraints:  1 <= N <= 10 1 <= length of String S <= 20 1 <= Q <= 5 1 <= L <= R <= 10^18 N will be all distinct   Example Input:  2 1 2 21 2 1 15 20 99 Output  1 12 0 0 
Pintel is a pirate and former Black Pearl crew member under Captain Barbossa. He was imprisoned after the Aztec curse was broken, but somehow escaped from there. Ragetti is Pintel's inseparable crew mate. He has a wooden eye, and despite being illiterate, has begun "reading" the Bible, with the excuse that "you get credit for trying."  Pintel and Ragetti are best friends, but their opinions differ in every thing. They like giving challenges to each other and to prove the other one wrong. One day Pintel gave Ragetti N numbers. Ragetti is highly optimistic so he likes positive numbers but Pintel, on the opposite, likes negative numbers. After getting the N numbers Ragetti can multiply any range [L, R] (1 <= L <= R <= N) by the number -1 atmost once so that sum of all the N numbers is maximum after the above operation is applied. Ragetti is weak in maths and programming. So, he needs your help as you are the only programmer among the crew members.   Input The first line contains the number of test cases T. The next lines give the description of the T test cases. The first line of the each test case contains the number of elements N. The second line contains all the N elements Pintel gave to Ragetti. (n1, n2, n3 ...)  Output The T lines of output would contain the maximum sum that could be created by Ragetti for each test case.  Constraints  1 <= T <= 10 1 <= N <= 100000 -100000 <= ni <= 100000   Example Input  2 5 1 2 3 4 5 5 -2 3 -1 -4 -2 Output  15 8 
The Flying Dutchman is a giant ship and the dock has many types of tasks which have to be done to keep the ship functional. Every crew member have their own taste in the kind of tasks that they find interesting. Davy Jones has published a list of tasks that he currently has and needs to be finished. Every crew member gives his preference as a list of tasks that he/she is interested to work on. Davy jones has N tasks to finish and N crew members working for him. All the N tasks are estimated to take exactly the same amount of time, so Jones has planned to assign one task to each crew member and every task is assigned to exactly one crew member. Jones is also a very understanding captain, so he wants to assign tasks to his team respecting everyone's preferences. You are the "Crew Chief" working for Jones, and are required to help him in doing the task assignment. Here are the questions that Jones wants you to answer:  1) Check if it is possible to assign all the tasks to his crew, respecting their preferences. 2) Count the number of (c, t) pairs, such that there is a way to assign all the tasks when crew member 'c' is assigned task 't'.  Input  The first line contains the number of test cases T. The next lines give the description of the T test cases. The first line of the each test case contains the number of tasks (same as number of crew members) N. The second line of the test case contains preferences of 1st crew member, 3rd line of the test case contains preferences of 2nd crew member .. and so on.. n+1^th line of the test cases contains preferences of n^th crew member. The preference of an engineer is specified as follows: number of tasks that the crew member is interested in 'k', followed by 'k' integers representing the unique id of the tasks that the crew member prefers.  Output You need to output T lines, with one line of output for each test case. The output of each test case should be of the form "X Y", where,X is 1 if it is possible to assign all the tasks, and 0 otherwise. Y is the number of (c, t) pairs such that there is a way to assign all the tasks such that crew member 'c' is assigned task 't'.  Constraints  1 <=T <= 50 2 <= N <= 100 1 <= k <= 100 1 <= task_id <= N   Example Input 2 4 2 1 2 2 2 3 2 2 3 2 3 4 4 2 1 2 3 2 3 4 1 3 1 3 Output 1 6 0 0 
  Its a fine Sunday in Dholakpur and our friends Bheem, Chhutki, Jaggu and Raju are playing tug of wars with Kalia and his team. Meanwhile their play they got tired and hence needed a break, Bheem  got hungry and we all know what he wants.... Yes you guessed it right, his all time favourite laddus. So, Chhutki offered him laddus, meanwhile Kalia noticed that the laddus where not spherical as they used to be but this time they were in the form of English alphabets. Kalia as we know is cunning got some idea to have those laddus from Bheem, and hence challenged Bheem for a game called “Game of Anagrams”. The challenge given to Bheem was to find all the different anagrams of the given laddus which we know are in the shape of English alphabets (A-Z and a-z) that can be generated with the help of the laddus taken k at a time. Assume all the laddus are of different shapes, help Bheem to win the Game of Anagrams.    Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.  Next T lines contains 2 space-separated integers  N  and k where N denotes the number of laddus given by Kalia to Bheem in a challenge and k denotes the number of laddus to be taken at a time for generating anagrams.     Output  For each test case, output a single line containing number of anagrams formed by taking k letters at a time.  Since the number can be very large print your answer modulo (10^9+7)     Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 50 1 ≤ N ≤ 52 1 ≤ k ≤ N     Example Input: 2 7 5 5 1  Output: 2520 5 
  Bheem and his friends were playing with numbers in the jungle but suddenly there came a storm, all the trees started displacing from their places, animals running here and there to survive the storm. Yes it was Kirmada back again to conquer Dholakpur, the only kingdom left in the world that was not conquered by him. He challenged Bheem again to save Dholakpur as this time Kirmada was even stronger than earlier, but this time the challenge was not to fight against him to save Dholakpur but the challenge was with numbers. With his magical power Kirmada concatenated all the number from  1  to N and gave Bheem a number  k  and challenged him to tell the digit at k^th index in the concatenated number. Help Bheem win this challenge and save Dholakpur.    Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.   Next T contains 2 space-separated integers N and k     Output  For each test case, output a single line containing the k^th digit (1-based indexing) in the concatenated number.      Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100000 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^15 1 ≤ k ≤ the length of concatenated number     Example Input: 2 10 5 15 16  Output: 5 1    Explanation Example case 1. concatenating all numbers from 1 to 10 gives 1234567810 and the 5th digit in the concatenated number is 5.  Example case 2. concatenating all numbers from 1 to 15 gives 123456789101112131415 and the 16th digit in the concatenated number is 1.  Note: The problem originally belongs to one of the Google Interview Questions. 
  We all know that our friend Bheem likes gcd of numbers very much. One day Kaalia challenged him with a new problem with gcd. He gave Bheem N numbers and asked to divide the given set of numbers into some disjoint subsequences. Two numbers a and b belong to same subsequence if  gcd(a,b)>1. Value of each subsequence is the largest number in that subsequence. He challenged Bheem to find the product of values of all subsequences. Help Bheem win this challenge.  Note: if gcd(a,b) >1, gcd (b,c) >1 then a,b,c will be in same subsequence even if gcd(a,c) = 1.     Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of elements in the set.  The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN elements in the set.     Output  For each test case output a single number, the answer to given problem modulo 1000000007, in a separate line.     Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ N ≤ 200 1 ≤ Ai ≤ 10^9     Example Input: 2 4 2 4 3 9 3 2 3 6  Output: 36 6   
  Recently Bheem and their friends studied well known fibonacci sequence in their school. Afibonacci sequence is generated by the recursive formula: F[n]=F[n-1]+F[n-2] where n>1 and F[0]=F[1]=1. Then Bheem started playing with similar type of sequences. In this process he came up with generalized tetranacci numbers.Generalized tetranacci numbers are defined by following recurrence relation: T[n] = a*T[n-1] + b*T[n-2] + c*T[n-3] + d*T[n-4] +e  (n>4) where  T[1], T[2], T[3] and T[4] can be any given integer.  Bheem tried to calculate the value of this sequence upto a given number n, but he was unable to calculate the value of n^th term instantly.Given the values of n, a, b, c, d, e, T[1], T[2], T[3] and T[4]. Help Bheem calculate the value of T[n]. As the answer can be very large, output the answer modulo 1000000007.  Note: The answer should always be a positive integer.     Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows The first line of each test case contains a single integer n.  The second line of each test cases contains 9 separated integers a, b, c, d, e, T[1], T[2], T[3] and T[4].     Output  For each test case, output a single line containing the answer to given problem modulo 1000000007     Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 1000 5 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 -10^9 ≤ a, b, c, d, e, T[1], T[2], T[3] and T[4] ≤ 10^9     Example Input: 1 5 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 Output: 5   
  Due to do his good deeds, Krishna asked Bheem for a wish. As we know our friend Bheem likes laddus very much so he wished that he wanted to be in a world full of tasty laddus. So, Krishna with his magic sent Bheem to a magical world full of laddus. In this magical world even laddus where magical. There Bheem found that enery that he can gain eating some of the laddus increases every day and those special laddus were placed in a N x M  rectangular grid, each cell E[i][j] (1 <= i <= N , 1 <= j <= M ) containing one special laddu eating which at d^th day gives enery equal to d * E[i][j] where E[i][j] is the enery of laddu in the cell (i,j) that can be gained by eating on day 1. Each day Bheem can only eat all laddus of leftmost column, rightmost column, topmost row or bottommost row of the grid. Help Bheem maximize the overall enery gained by eating the laddus if he starts eating them on day 1.    Input  First line of each test case contains two space separated integers N and M. Then N lines follows, each of which contains M space separated integers representing the initial eanery that can be gained by eating the laddus.     Output   For each test case output a single number denoting the maximum enery that can be gained by eating the laddus.      Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 50 1 ≤ N,M ≤ 32 1 ≤ E[i][j] ≤ 10^9     Example Input: 1 2 2 1 2 3 4 Output: 21   Explanation Example case 1. Initially the grid representing the laddus is : {{1,2},{3,4}}. Bheem will gain optimal energy, when he will eat the laddus in following order. On 1st day Bheem eats all laddus of 1st row (topmost row). Energy gained by Bheem on 1st day = 1+2 = 3 The resultant grid becomes {{3,4}}. On 2nd day Bheem eats all laddus of 1st column (leftmost column). Energy gained by Bheem on 2nd day = 2*3 = 6. The resultant grid becomes {{4}} (there is only 1 element). On 3rd day Bheem eats the only laddu. Energy gained by Bheem on 3rd day = 3*4 = 12. Therefore, the total energy gained by Bheem after eating all the laddus = 3 + 6 + 12 = 21.  
Chef Polo is experimenting with Prime Numbers. He can quickly tell whether a number is prime or not. His friend Palin knows about it, so he twists the question. Palin challenges his friend to check whether a number P is "almost prime" or not. The number P is said to be almost prime if it has exactly 3 distinct divisors.

  Rahul and Jupiter are playing a new game called Alien Numbers. They defined L as the length of a given number when the number is in base 10(decimal). Now they are finding new methods to determine numbers which are Alien in a given range. A number N with L ≥ 1 is considered to be alien iff:   N is divisible by L,   N/L is alien recursively,  Since this task contains very large range of numbers and Jupiter needs to return to his planet, therefore they need your help in finding how many numbers are there in a interval X and Y (both inclusive).    Input First line of input contains T, the number of testcases. Next T lines contains two integers X and Y defining the range.    Output For each case output a single integer denoting the number of Alien Numbers between X and Y.    Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 200 0 ≤ X ≤ 10^18 0 ≤ Y ≤ 10^18     Example Input: 2 7 25 45 50  Output: 10 1    Explanation Example case 2 : Only 48 satisfies the given properties.

Dr.Zero lives in Treeland. Tree land consists of a tree with N nodes connected by N-1 weighted undirected edges. The nodes of the tree are numbered from 1 to N. The tree is rooted at node 1.   Dr. Zero wanted to create a super amazing experiment. Before starting the experiment, he has laid out few important definitions needed.    A subtree rooted at node x is defined recursively. It contains node x and the nodes in the subtrees of its children nodes. The strategic cost of a node in the subtree is defined as the distance to the farthest node from it in the whole subtree. The strategic cost of a subtree is defined by the minimum of strategic cost of all the nodes in the subtree.   In the experiment, he found strategic cost of subtree of each node in the tree. Sadly, he has misplaced the paper containing those results and now seeks your help.   Input  The first line of input contains one integer T, the number of test cases. For each test case: the first line contains N, the number of nodes. In the next N-1 lines, each line contains 3 integers u,v,w which indicates an edge between node u and v with length w.   Output For each test case, output N lines, i-th of those should contain an integer corresponding to the strategic cost of subtree rooted at vertex i.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 50 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^4   Example Input: 1 6 1 2 5 1 5 6 2 3 2 2 4 1 3 6 1 Output: 8 3 1 0 0 0  Explanation  The cost of the tree rooted at vertex 1 is 8, because the vertex with the minimum strategic cost is 1 and the farthest vertex from it 6 with distance 8. The cost of the tree rooted at vertex 2 is 3, here both vertices 2 and 3 have minimum strategic cost; the farthest vertex from 3 is 4 with distance 3 and the farthest vertex from 2 is 6 with distance 3 as well. In the tree rooted at 3, both 3 and 6 have minimum strategic cost. The rest of the trees are single-node trees because they're rooted at leaves.  
 Today is Chota Mouse's birthday. He wants to celebrate it in a grand style. His brother Mota Chuha immediately contacted a nearby bakery for an online delivery of a cake. The cake is of rectangular shape with height H and width W. Chota Mouse has invited F of his friends to the party. So, he wants to make F vertical cuts at distinct positions on the cake, so that the cake will be divided into F + 1 non-zero area parts (F for his friends and one for himself).   Let us assume the cake is placed along the coordinate axis with its left end at x coordinate 0 and right end at W. Please see the image in the examples for details. He will make cuts at positions Pi such that Pi is strictly greater than zero and strictly less than W. Also note that, all the positions for cutting are distinct.   Chota Mouse is a nice guy. So, he will be keeping the piece with the least area for himself and leave the other pieces for his friends to enjoy. Chota Mouse is weak in mathematics, so can you please help him figure out the area of the piece he is going to have?  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. First line of each test case contains three space separated integers F, H, W. Second line of each test case contains F space separated integers, i-th of them denotes Pi. Output For each test case, print a single integer corresponding to the answer of the problem. Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ F ≤ 500 1 ≤ H ≤ 10000 F + 1 ≤ W ≤ 10000 1 ≤ Pi ≤ W - 1  Sample  Input  3 1 1 2 1 1 4 5 3 2 3 9 6 2  Output  1 8 6  Explanation In the first example, both the pieces have same area (i.e. = 1).   In the second example, there are two pieces. First piece has an area of 12, second has an area of 8. So, the answer will be 8.   In the third example, there are three pieces. First piece has an area of 6, second 12, and third 9. So, the answer will be 6.

But he is not very sure if he correctly solved it. Can you help him in verifying the answer.     The problem looks like:       There is a grid of size N x M, there are C unit radii circles with integer center coordinates ((x0,y0), (x1,y1) .... (xc-1, yc-1)) on the grid. Choose any square portion of that grid with side length A such that the sides of the square are parallel to the sides of grid, corners of this square must be inside or on the boundary of the grid and their coordinates are integers. Find the expected area covered by circles inside that square if you were to choose such a square randomly on the grid. Answer must be correct upto 6 places of decimal.  Input     First line will contain N, M, A, and C i.e number of rows, number of columns, side of the square and total number of cirlces respectively. Next C lines contains coordinates of center of circles. Output     One line containing expected area covered by circles correct upto 6 places of decimal.

Case 2: These are 4 possible ways to choose a square with side length 2 and two of them will contain one quadrant of a circle each.   
  COINS       Our Farzi Coder likes Mota Chuha a lot, as he runs very fast and catching him is not only hard, but also impossible.       The city is in the form of a tree (Graph Theory Tree), with N junctions with exactly one follower of Farzi Coder in each. There are N-1 bidirectional roads connecting these junctions such that there is exactly one distinct path between any pair of junctions.       Now Farzi Coder decides to distribute some of his illegal wealth among his followers so as to maintain their loyalty and wants Mota Chuha to do this task for him. In between the process of distribution, Farzi Coder would also ask Mota Chuha some questions, to check if he is really distributing the coins correctly or not.       Now for the next Q days, on each day, he assigns exactly one of the following two tasks to the Mota Chuha:  Give(X,Y,W) => Give one W rupee coin to all followers along the path in the tree between the followers X and Y (including X and Y). Find(Z, I, J, K) => Find the K'th smallest coin among all the coins present in the hands of follower Z which were distributed between I'th and J'th day (including I'th and J'th Days). If Z has less than K coins, then report -1. It is guaranteed that J will be less than the current day number.   Mota Chuha is too lazy to distribute the wealth. But he has to answer the Find() tasks. He knows that ICPC participants are very smart and can simulate the Update() tasks through a program and can answer the Find() tasks very fast. So please help him, he might give some of the coins to you.   		Note that a person can hold multiple coins of same value. Let us say, person Z has P coins with him which were distributed between I'th and J'th Days, i.e, Coin[1], Coin[2]...C[P]. Sort the array Coin[1...P]. Now, K'th smallest coin is Coin[K].   		Example: If person Z has coins {1, 2, 3, 3, 4}. Then, 2nd smallest coin is 2, 3rd smallest coin is 3, 4th smallest coin is 3, 5th smallest coin is 4.   Note:Number of Update tasks will be less 51% of the total tasks. The memory limit of the problem will be 1.5 GB.  Input  	The first line contains one integer N, size of the tree.   	Next N-1 lines contain two space separated integers "X Y" (without quotes) each, representing that there is an edge between the nodes (X, Y).   	Next line contains an integer Q.   	Next Q lines contains the tasks given to Mota Chuha. If the first integer in the line is 1, then it is followed by three integers space separated integers "X Y W" (without quotes) denoting the first type of task. Else if the first integer in the line is 2, then it is followed by 4 space separated integers "Z I J K" (without quotes) denoting the second type of task.  Output     For each task of type 2, output the required answer.

Chef has a problem with the new city he has invented. The city has N buildings and there are bridges which connect some pair of buildings in such a way that there is exactly one path between any pair of buildings. (i.e. They form a tree). All bridges are of equal length. Distance between two buildings is the sum of lengths all bridges connecting the two buildings. Now chef wants to find for each building i, the number of buildings that are farthest from it.  Input format  First line contains an integer N.  Next N - 1 lines contains 2 integers each. i+1^th line contains ui and vi which means that there is a bridge between  ui and vi   Output format  Print N integers seperated by a space in a single line denoting the answer for each building  Constraints   2 ≤ N ≤ 10^5  0 ≤ ui , vi &lt N for all i from 1 to N - 1    Example  Input 4 0 1 1 2 1 3  Output 2 3 2 2   Explanation 2 and 3 are farthest from 0 (both at a distance of 2 bridges). So there are 2 of them and hence first number is 2. 0,2 and 3 are farthest from 1. So the next number is 3. Similarly for 2 and 3. 
 After attending Amrita summer training camp, N programmers, getting bored of programming, decided to have a car race. Each of them bring their own car to the race. As the camp also includes school children, to level the playing field, some of the coders are allowed to have a head start. The i^th programmer starts his race at a distance Di ahead of the starting line at time T = 0. The speed of the car of the i^th coder is equal to Si. After time T, the position of i^th coder will be Pi(T) = Si * T + Di. Let's define f(T) = max(Pi(T)) - min(Pj(T)). The race ends at time T = K. You need to find the minimum value of f(T) during the whole race.  Input The first line of the input contains two integers N and K denoting the number of coders and the duration of the race. The next N lines contains two integers each, i^th line contains Si and Di.  Output Output the minimum value of f(T) during the whole race exactly upto 6 places after the decimal point.  Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ Si ≤ 10^5 0 ≤ Di ≤ 10^5   Example  Input:  2 10 20 0 10 10  Output:  0.000000   Explanation At t = 1 sec, both the coders will have same position, which makes f(1) = 0.

Chef's great great grand child has found a way to send messages back in time to him to tell the coordinates of a place where chef can find treasure. His evil twin brother has also found a way to send messages back in time and he too sends the coordinates of a place to chef. But this place, instead of containing a treasure actually contains a witch who kills whoever she meets. Chef sees that he has recieved two messages and becomes suspicious. He decides to find the manhattan distance between these two points. If this value is greater than a certain value D then he decides not to visit any of the two places since there is a high chance that there might be danger in one of the places. If it is less than or equal to D then he decides to visit the midpoint of the two coordinates in the hope that he can actually see which place contains the treasure from there. The messages are encoded as a string and sent by the brothers as string S1 and S2 respectively. You can convert the string into the 26 dimensional coordinate by doing the following. The first coordinate is the number of times the character 'a' occurs, the second coordinate is the number of times the character 'b' occurs, and so on and the 26th coordinate is the number of times the character 'z' occurs. All the characters of the string will be lowercase alphabets.  You can read about manhattan distance here: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Manhattan_distance  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The next T lines contains two strings and an integer separated by a space S1 and S2 and D.  Output For each test case print "YES" (without quotes) if chef decides to visit the midpoint of the two coordinates, else print "NO" (without quotes), in a separate line.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10^2 1 ≤ |S1| ≤ 10^2 1 ≤ |S2| ≤ 10^2 1 ≤ D ≤ 10^2   Example  Input:  2 ab ab 2 ab cd 1  Output:  YES NO 
It was a lovely evening in Morocco so Sundar decided to take his girlfriend out for a ride in his new car. They started from his house and decided to go to the outskirts of the city. The only problem was that his car was a sports car and so it had very low mileage. In order to overcome this he decides to refill his tank in the petrol bunks that are present along his route. He doesn't want to get embarrassed in front of his girlfriend, so he takes just enough money that he needs to pay at the petrol bunks such that he can reach his destination. He is travelling from the point (0, 0) to the point (L, 0) along the x-axis. There are n petrol bunks along the path at positions given by Xi such that 0 < Xi < L. To refill at the i^th station he has to pay a cost Ci. He can only refill his tank fully at each station. His car has a mileage of D, meaning it can cover a distance D after completely refilling, after which it becomes empty. You need to print the minimum money that Sundar would have taken with himself for the ride. Initially assume he has a full tank.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The first line corresponding to each test case contains three integers N, L and D denoting the number of petrol bunks, the distance he needs to travel to reach his destination and the mileage of Sundar's car. The next N lines contains two integers each, i^th line contains Xi and Ci.  Output For each test case print "NO" if it is impossible to reach the destination. If it is possible print "YES" and print the minimum amount Sundar would have taken with him for the ride, both in the same line separated by a space.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9 1 ≤ D ≤ 10^9 1 ≤ Xi < L 1 ≤ Ci ≤ 10^4   Example  Input:  2 7 20 5 2 5 3 6 7 2 10 4 12 3 16 2 19 1 4 8 3 2 4 1 2 4 5 3 2  Output:  YES 12 NO  Explanation In the first case Sundar can refuel his car at petrol bunk's present at positions 2, 7, 12, 16 and reach the destination at position 20. Hence the cost of refuelling is 5 + 2 + 3 + 2 = 12. Note that the distance between any two consecutive petrol bunks is not more than the mileage of the Sundar's car. In the second case, the farthest petrol bunk from starting point is present at position Xi = 4, if he refuels at this petrol bunk, he can only go till X = 4 + 3 = 7. But his destination is at X = 8, hence it is impossible for Sundar to reach his destination. 
 Farzi Coder has been assigned an important coding assignment by his boss Programmer Bhai. Now, Farzi Coder has done coding his project and has to submit it to a central git repository.     In git, before committing we have to add the files which we want to commit to the stage. We can add (stage) or remove (unstage) files to/from the stage. Initially the stage is empty. Programmer Bhai is very particular about what goes into the repository and what doesn't. He has given a list of files alongwith whether he wants the file in the stage or not.     e.g.      stage /code/lib/acpp     stage /code/lib/bcpp     unstage /code/lib/aout      This means we want /code/lib/acpp and /code/lib/bcpp to be in the stage while /code/lib/aout should not be in the stage.     There are 2 git commands to control staging:     git add <path>     git remove <path>      The path here can be a path to a file or a path to a directory. If the path is to a directory, the command applies to all the files and subdirectories inside that directory recursively.  Farzi Coder wants to commit the code asap.     What is the minimum number of git commands needed to add all the required files to stage while making sure none of the unstage files are in the stage. Input     The first line of the input has the number T denoting the number of test cases.      The first line of each test case has the number N denoting the number of files in this case.      Each of the next N lines contains a word denoting whether the following file should be on the stage or not followed by the path to the file.      i.e. the 2 types of input will be stage <path> and unstage <path>. Output      For each test case, output the number of minimum git commands needed.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ N ≤ 100 The length of each path doesn't exceed 100 Each path is a valid path to a file. Each path input follows these rules:  It doesn't end with a forward slash (/) Each path starts from the root directory (/) There are no two consecutive forward slashes Each file or directory name consists only of lowercase alphabets All paths in a test case are distinct There will be no file - directory conflict. e.g. consider /a/b/c and /a/b. Here b is both a file and a directory.   Sample  Input 3 3 stage /code/lib/acpp stage /code/lib/bcpp unstage /code/lib/aout 2 unstage /code/lib/acpp unstage /code/lib/bcpp 3 stage /code/lib/acpp stage /code/lib/bcpp stage /code/lib/aout  Output 2 0 1  Explanation  Case 1: The following 2 commands are enough:     git add /     git remove /code/lib/aout         The first command adds the entire project to the stage while the second command removes aout from the stage as required.  Case 2: As initially there are no files in the stage, no commands are necassary.  Case 3: We add all the files to stage using git add / or git add /code/lib/ 
!doctype>       Our well known coding mafia went to the city. Farzi Coder is the boss here. He hired a new member named Lambu Keyboard in his gang. Farzi Coder is so smart (at least that's what he thinks), so he wants to test Lambu Keyboard's programming skills. He gave him this task:    There are n buildings (numbered from left to right) with heights H1, H2...Hn. You can start jumping from any building.      The rules of jumping are:    You can only jump to a building with lesser height than the height of the current building.  In first turn you can jump either way, and 2^nd jump will be in the opposite direction of previous jump and must end in between current index and previous index, i.e if we start jumping from building 5, initially we can jump in either direction. Let's say we jump to building 8, then in next jump we can only jump in left direction and only on buildings with indices 6, 7. Let's say we jump to building 6, then next time we can only jump in right direction and between 6 and 8 i.e to 7.        We need to find the maximum number of jumps he can make, considering every building as the starting point. Input   First line contains an integer n i.e. the number of buildings.     Second line contains n space separated integers denoting heights of buildings from 1 to n. Output   One line containing n integers, the i^th integer will denote the maximum possible number of jumps starting from i^th building. Constraints  1 ≤ n ≤ 5000 1 ≤ H1, H2 ... Hn ≤ 10000  Sample  Input 5 1 3 4 2 5  Output 0 1 1 1 2  Explanation   If starting building is with height 1 then you can't jump to any other building.   If starting building is with height 3 then you can jump either to building with height 2 on right or with height 1 on left. But there will be at most one jump.   If starting building is with height 5 then one possible optimal sequence is to jump to building with height 3 then to building with height 2. So maximum number of jumps is 2.   
 Farzi Coder wants to give a nice Christmas present to his brother. For that he has brought N pairs of letters where each letter is either 'a' or 'b'. So, the possible pairs are "aa", "ab", "ba" or "bb". Now, Farzi Coder's brother loves palindromes. So, he decided to concatenate some of the pairs (possibly all or none) and form a palindrome. He wants the longest such palindrome possible. If there are multiple such longest palindromes possible, he wants to give his brother the lexicographically smallest palindrome among them as the gift. Since he is, well, Farzi Coder, you have to help him build the gift. Input     The first line of the input has the number T denoting the number of test cases.      The first line of each test case has the number N denoting the number of pairs  in this case.      Each of the next N lines contain a pair of characters which are either aa, ab, ba or bb. Output     For each test case, output on a seperate line the gift that Farzi Coder has to build. Note that the empty string is a palindrome. Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 500 1 ≤ N ≤ 2000 Each pair can be either aa, ab, ba or bb   Sample  Input 2 4 aa aa bb bb 3 ab ba ab  Output aabbbbaa abba   Explanation  Case 1: The following palindromes are possible: "aa", "aaaa", "bb", "bbbb", "aabbaa", "bbaabb", "aabbbbaa", "bbaaaabb". Of these, "aabbbbaa" and "bbaaaabb" are of the maximum length. Among these two, "aabbbbaa" is the lexicographically smallest.  Case 2: The palindromes possible here are: "baab" and "abba".   
Australia and New Zealand have started working on preparation for the World Cup 2015. There are N important venues (like hotels and stadiums) in the city. Out of these important venues, there is one central location where the opening and closing ceremony will be held. There is an existing network of bidirectional roads connecting these venues. The organizing committee has planned to decorate some of these roads that will be used for commuting. They have decided to choose the roads to decorate such that there is exactly one decorated path to all the venues from the central location. New Zealand is supposed to decorate these roads and Australia has taken up the responsibility of providing transportation. Only decorated roads can be used for transportation. Australia wanted to save fuel costs, and so they wanted to choose the decorated roads to minimize the total sum of distances to all venues from the central location. However, New Zealand had their own plans to minimize decoration cost by choosing the decorated roads such that the sum of the length of the chosen roads will be minimized. To prevent a fight breaking out between these two rivals before they even step on to the field, you have to help them by reporting if there is a solution in which the two rivals could choose the same set of roads while satisfying their respective constraints. Input: The first line contains the number of test cases T. For each test first line contains N and M which are number of venues and total number of roads respectively. Then next M lines for each case contains u, v and w - indicating that there is a bidirectional road of distance w between locations u and v. The central location is identified with location 0. Output: For each test case, output the required answer on a separate line. If there is a valid plan, then print “YES”. Else, print “NO” (quotes for clarity). Note: If any of the venues is not reachable from the central location, then print “NO”. Constraints: 1 <= T <= 10000 1 <= N <= 20000 0 <= M <= 40000 0 <= u < N 0 <= v < N u != v 1 <= w <= 10^9 The sum of values of N over all test cases will not be more than 1000000. The sum of values of M over all test cases will not be more than 2000000.   Example: Sample Input: 3 3 3 0 1 1 0 2 2 1 2 2 3 1 0 1 1 4 5 2 1 9 3 2 5 0 3 9 0 1 2 3 1 9   Sample Output: YES NO NO   Explanation: For the first case, both of them can choose the roads {0<-->1, 0<-->2}. For the second case, venue 2 is not reachable from the central location 0.   
The Indian team is known for their strong batting and sloppy bowling. The captain M.S. Dhoni is concerned about this issue. He wants to address this by pairing up bowlers who have good economy rates. He has all the bowlers' economy rates as integers. Unfortunately, these are T20 figures and to convert them to ODI format, he wants to pair up bowlers in such a way that the sum of the economy rates of two bowlers, modulo M, is always less than or equal to X. Given the economy rates, M and X, can you tell him how many such ordered pairs are possible? Note: The pair of bowlers chosen by him can be the same. Yeah, Dhoni has won a cup in all limited over formats, but he definitely needs to sharpen his math skills. Input: The first line contains the number of test cases T. Each test case contains N, M and X on the first line, followed by N space separated integers A[1..N] on the second line. Output: Output T lines, containing the answer for the corresponding test case. Constraints: 1 <= T <= 10 1 <= N <= 100000 0 <= X < M <= 100000 0 <= A[i] <= 1000000000 Sample Input: 2 3 5 3 1 2 3 4 7 4 31 12 11 17 Sample Output: 6 12 Explanation: For the first example, the valid pairs are (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3).     
The Cricket World Cup 2015 is nearing and it will be held in Australia and New Zealand. The organizing committee is planning to give a welcome gift to each team member. After careful thought and planning, they have decided on Matryoshka dolls.  A Matryoshka doll refers to a set of wooden dolls of strictly decreasing size, placed one inside the other. Any doll can contain only one doll directly inside it. Given the sizes of N dolls, output "YES" if it is possible to nest them all and have one doll on the outside and "NO" otherwise. Input - The input starts with T denoting the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains N, which is the total number of dolls. The second line contains N space separated integers denoting the size of the dolls. Output -  Print “YES” if the dolls can be nested inside each other and “NO” otherwise. (quotes for clarity) Constraints - 1 <= T <= 100 1 <= N <= 100 1 <= doll size <= 1000 Sample Input -  3 3 3 1 1 2  1 2 4 10 2 5 3   Sample Output - NO YES YES Explanation - For the first case, there are 2 dolls of size 1 and hence cannot be nested inside each other. For the second case, the doll with size 1 can be put inside the doll with size 2. 
The New Zealand government is super-excited about the Cricket World Cup 2015 happening in their country. Hence, it has decided to conduct a census on cricket to find out how many people are interested in the sport, etc. The statistics obtained are given to us as a range of numbers from A to B (inclusive). In these statistics, the government is interested in some particular numbers called "Kiwi Numbers". A number is called a Kiwi Number if it has a prime number of distinct factors. A prime number N has exactly two divisors, 1 and N. Can you help the government by calculating the number of Kiwi numbers in the given range?  Input: The first line contains the number of test cases T. Each of the next T lines contains two space separated numbers A and B. Output: For each test case, output the required answer on a separate line. Constaints: 1 <= T <= 100 2 <= A <= B <= 1000000000 B - A <= 200000 Sample Input: 3 2 10 100 100 578 720 Sample Output: 6 0 23 Explanation: For the first case, the Kiwi numbers are 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9.   
It’s World cup time, and every player wants to get a cool jersey number. As a result, there was a fight between the players about what jersey number they can have. To resolve this, the committee (ICC) came up with an idea.  They gave a huge string and asked each player to walk in one by one, and select four indices in the string (i, j, k, l) such that i<=j and k<=l and the substrings S[i..j], S[k..l] should have a non-empty substring in common. Also, (i, j, k, l) should not have been chosen by any player who walked in earlier. If the player is able to give a correct answer (i, j, k, l), he gets "i-j-k-l" as his jersey number. Assuming that there are enough players to claim all valid jersey numbers, and that all players are equally smart (i.e if there is any valid (i, j, k, l), then they’ll give the right answer), find the number of distinct jersey numbers that can be assigned. Note: The huge string chosen by the ICC is hexadecimal. (Only contains ‘0’-‘9’ and upper-case characters ‘A’-‘F’). Input: The first line of input contains a single integer ’T’, denoting the no. of test cases. Each of the following ’T’ lines contains a sting S, chosen by the ICC. Output: Print one line for each test case, denoting the answer modulo 1000000007. Constraints: 1 <= T <= 200 1 <= |S| <= 100000 1 <= Sum of |S| over all test cases <= 1000000 S is hexadecimal. (Only contains ‘0’-‘9’ and upper-case characters ‘A’-‘F’) Sample Input: 3 AB ACC A2011 Sample Output: 7 30 163 Explanation: For the case "AB", following are valid jersey numbers: {“1-1-1-1”, “1-1-1-2”, “1-2-1-1”, “1-2-1-2”, “1-2-2-2”, “2-2-1-2”, “2-2-2-2”}     
MCG (Melbourne Cricket Ground) is hosting the finals of the Cricket World Cup 2015. In order to capture shots of boundary hits and balls being rubbed on pants with equal clarity, the organizers have decided to arrange n cameras of different resolutions at n different positions on a vertical stand according to a 'Hugphile Order', in remembrance of Phil Hughes. In a Hugphile Order, the cameras are ordered linearly on a vertical stand at positions p1 to pn, such that the camera at position pi (for i = 2..n) has higher resolution than the camera at position p(i/2), where / stands for integer division.   Assuming that the resolutions of the n cameras are in the range 1 to n (both inclusive) and given a camera with resolution m, find the number of possible positions where it can be placed on the stand such that the cameras are in Hugphile Order. Input: First line contains number of testcases, T. Each of the next T lines contain two space-separated integers, n and m Output: Print the answer for each test case on a separate line. Constraints: 1 <= T <= 10^5 1 <= n <= 10^18 1 <= m <= n  Sample Input: 3 2 1 4 2 5 3 Sample Output: 1 2 4 Explanation: For the first example, camera with resolution 1 can come at position p1 only. For the third example, camera with resolution 3 can come at any position except position p1. 
Having won the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup, India is definitely one of the favorites to win the 2015 World Cup. In preparations for the 2015 World Cup, the coach of the Indian cricket team (well, Duncan Fletcher, not Ravi Shastri) wants to experiment with opening batsmen pairs.  An opening pair is denoted by (A, B), meaning that batsman A takes strike and batsman B is the non-striker. There are 'N' matches remaining before the World Cup starts. Being rather meticulous and eager to keep his high salary, the coach wants to experiment with opening batsmen pairs based on the following conditions: 1) No batsman A should face the first ball in more than 1 match, i.e., cannot be the opening striker in more than 1 match. 2) No batsman B should be the 2nd opener in more than 1 match, i.e., cannot be the opening non-striker in more than 1 match. 3) The same opening pair cannot open the batting in more than one match, i.e., if (A, B) open the batting in some match, then neither (A, B) nor (B, A) can open the batting in any other match. Note: The opening pair (A, B) is different from the opening pair (B, A). Also, it goes without saying that the two batsmen in the opening pair should be distinct, i.e (A, A) is not a valid opening pair. The coach has a total of 'K' batsmen to choose from, and was wondering in how many ways he could choose the opening pairs for the N matches modulo 1000000007. Input: The first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases.  Each of the following ’T’ lines contain 2 space separated integers N, K. You need to find the number of ways of choosing the opening pairs for N matches, given K players to choose from. Output: For each test case, print the required answer modulo 1000000007 on a separate line. Constraints: 1 <= T <= 1000 1 <= N <= 10^5 0 <= K <= 10^18 1 <= sum of N over all cases <= 10^6 Sample Input: 3 1 2 2 2 3 3 Sample Output: 2 0 12 Explanation: For the case N=1, K=2, there are 2 ways to choose the opening pairs => {(1,2)}, {(2,1)} For the case N=3, K=3, there are 12 ways to choose the opening pairs. Some of them are: {(1,3), (2,1), (3,2)}, {(1,2), (2,3), (3,1)}, {(1,2), (3,1), (2,3)} … etc.   
Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma are warming up for the World Cup at the Brisbane Cricket Ground, commonly known as "The Gabba". Their coach has asked them to go to the ground at the crack of dawn, and then jog around the stadium in laps. The Cricket Ground has poles spaced equally apart and numbered sequentially from 1 to N. The first M-1 poles lead up to the entrance of the stadium, and the poles numbered M, M+1, ... N are arranged circularly around the stadium, with pole M being next to pole N. Both players start running from pole 1. They always go from pole i to pole i+1, except when i = N, where they go from pole N to pole M.  Due to their different levels of fitness - something that their coach is quite upset about with Virat, that being another story - they have different running speeds P and Q, measured in poles/minute. They have been asked to run for ‘S’ minutes each. Since they can’t keep running for long, the coach has asked them to do short sprints of 1 minute each. First, Virat sprints and covers P poles in 1 minute and stops. Then Rohit sprints and covers Q poles in 1 minute and stops. Virat starts again, and they keep doing this for 2*S minutes (S minutes each). Virat and Rohit are considered to meet if they are at the same pole at the end of some  minute. Can you tell how many times they will meet during their jogging routine?   Input: The first line contains the number of test cases, T. This is followed by T lines, one for each test case. Each test case contains five integers - N, M, S, P and Q. Output: For each test case, output the answer on a new line. Constraints: 1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ M < N ≤ 500 1 ≤ S ≤ 100000 1 ≤ P,Q ≤ 500 P ≠ Q Sample Input: 2 4 1 4 2 3 5 3 10 1 2 Sample Output: 1 3 Explanation: For the first example, Kohli’s position at the end of his 1st, 2nd, 3rd & 4th minutes of run is {3, 1, 3, 1} respectively. While Rohit’s position at the end of his 1st, 2nd, 3rd & 4th minutes of run is {4, 3, 2, 1} respectively. Therefore, they meet exactly once after 8 minutes (their 4 minutes) at pole 1. For the second example, they would meet at the end of their 3rd (total 6th), 6th (total 12th) & 9th (total 18th) minute of run. 
The opening ceremony of the 2015 World Cup will be organized in Christchurch, New Zealand on the 14th of February, 2015. The World Cup organizers have planned an artwork in the form of huge grey circles with black boundaries. They hired number of artists to paint these N circles with each artist painting one circle. However, the artists got carried away by their rivalry and painted over each other’s work, resulting in the some circles overlapping with each other. When two circles overlap, only the later painted one is fully visible, and the earlier painted one and its boundary are partly obscured by the later painted one. The organizers are interested in knowing the total length of the visible black boundary after all N circles have been painted.    Input: The first line contains the number of test cases, T. For each test case, the first line contains N, the total number of circles. Each of the next N lines contains 3 space-separated integers xi, yi and ri, where (xi, yi) is the centre and ri is the radius of the i-th circle. Assumption is that the ith circle will be painted after the 1 to (i-1)th circles and will obscure the intersecting parts of any of these circles that it overlaps with. Note: No 2 circles will overlap completely. In other words, no 2 circles will have the same center and same radius.   Output: For each test case, output the length of the total visible boundary colored black. Absolute error of upto 10^-6 is allowed. Constraints: 1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ N ≤ 100 -10^6 <= yi <= 10^6 -10^6 <= yi <= 10^6     1 <= ri <= 10^6 Sample Input: 2 2 0 0 100 300 0 100 2 0 0 100 150 0 100 Sample Output: 1256.637061 1112.090212 Explanation: For the first example, both circles' boundary is completely visible. For the second example, first circle's boundary is partially visible and second circle's boundary is completely visible.   
Chota Pendrive likes to play with strings a lot. For a given string s, he obtains its compressed string in the following way:   In a single operation, he takes any two consecutive equal characters of s, and removes one of them.  He keeps doing this operation as long as possible.  The resulting string will be the compressed string of s. e.g. if the initial string is "abaaabb", its compressed form is "abab".   Two strings s and t are said to be similar if their compressed strings are equal.   You have to find the number of ordered pairs of similar strings (s, t) having length at least one and at most N. Both s, t contain lower case English alphabet. As the answer could be large, print it modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7).  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. Each test case contains a single integer N. Output For each test case, print a single integer corresponding to the answer of the problem. Constraints  1 ≤ T, N ≤ 5000  Sample  Input  2 1 2  Output  26 754  Explanation In the first example, s and t will be equal and will contain the same character. There are 26 possibilities for that from 'a' to 'z'.  In the second example, we can count the possible (s, t) similar pairs in the following way.   Case 1: s is same as t, there are 26 (each string contains 1 character) + 26 * 26 (each string contains 2 characters) possibilites for that. Case 2: s is of type aa and t is of type a, where a is some character. There are 26 possible cases for this. Case 3: s is of type a and t is of type aa, where a is some character. There are 26 possible cases for this.  So, in total, there are 26 + 26 * 26 + 26 + 26 = 754 ordered (s, t) pairs.

 Captain Rex has been cornered by a battalion of droids and is trying to escape. The droids are in a matrix formation of size N × N. Captain Rex's ammunition is enough to kill only N droids. In order to escape the droids, he must kill one droid from every row and one droid from every column.   Every droid is assigned a number, which is a complicated function of its attributes and rank. More specifically, a droid in row i and column j has been given the number A(i, j). The damage inflicted upon the droid army by killing N droids with numbers X1, X2, ... XN is  bitwise AND of the integers X1, X2, ... XN.   Captain Rex, of course, also wants to cause maximum damage to the droid army. Find the maximum damage he can possibly inflict by killing N droids as he escapes. To reiterate, he must kill exactly one droid from each row and each column to be able to escape successfully.   Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the size of the matrix. The next N lines contain N space-separated integers. Specifically, j^th integer on i^th line contains A(i, j), denoting the number assigned to the corresponding battle droid.   Output  For each test case, output a single line containing an integer corresponding to the maximum damage that Captain Rex can inflict.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ N ≤ 100 0 ≤ A(i, j) ≤ 10^18   Example Input: 2 3 5 7 1 3 4 13 2 7 3 2 3 9 4 1 Output: 5 1  Explanation Example case 1. You can cause a total damage of 5 units by choosing the droids in positions (1, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2) so that the damage incurred is 5 & 13 & 7 = 5. Example case 2. You can select (1, 1) and (2,2) to inflict damage = 3 & 1 = 1. 
 Problem description You will be given a zero-indexed array A. You need to rearrange its elements in such a way that the following conditions are satisfied:  A[i] ≤ A[i+1] if i is even. A[i] ≥ A[i+1] if i is odd.  In other words the following inequality should hold: A[0] ≤ A[1] ≥ A[2] ≤ A[3] ≥ A[4], and so on. Operations ≤ and ≥ should alter.  Input The first line contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains an integer N, that is the size of the array A. The second line of each test case contains the elements of array A  Output For each test case, output a single line containing N space separated integers, which are the elements of A arranged in the required order. If there are more than one valid arrangements, you can output any of them.  Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 100000 Sum of N in one test file ≤ 600000 1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10^9   Example Input: 2 2 3 2 3 10 5 2  Output: 2 3 2 10 5    Explanation Example case 1. A[0] ≤ A[1] is satisfied, 2 ≤ 3. Example case 2. A[0] ≤ A[1] is satisfied, 2 ≤ 10. A[1] ≥ A[2] is satisfied, 10 ≥ 5. Note: 5 10 2 is also valid answer.  
A number is said to be a palindrome if it remains the same when it is read backwards. Eg. 12021 is pallindrome while 21 is not A number is called total-palindromic if it contains a palindrome with odd length greater than 1 and an even palindrome as a substring. For example, the number 22676 is total-palindromic whereas the number 101 is not because it contains the palindrome of odd length 676 and even length 22. While 101 does not contain an even palindrome as a substring. You are given 2 numbers a, b. Output the number of total-palindromic numbers which lie in the range (a,b] i.e set { a+1, a+2, .... b }  Input First line contains number of test cases T. Each test case contains 2 lines.  First line contains the number a Second line contains the number b   Output Output T lines, each line containing an integer - the answer to the test case.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 99 ≤ a < b ≤ 10^18   Example Input: 2 99 100 110 119  Output: 0 1  Explanation In second test case the range is between 110 and 119 i.e the numbers 111,112,113,114,115,116,117,118,119. Of these only 111 contains the odd palindromic substring 111 and even palindromic substring 11. So the answer to this test-case is 1 
 For Turbo C++ Users : Read the following document before attempting the question :   Problem Description Hank Pym is an aspiring student at IIITD. He has almost completed his work on Ultron, the ultimate artificial intelligence. However, one thing remains. He feels that Ultron should have a fail-safe code which can be used to switch him off (just in case Ultron decides to wipe out our race). So, he encodes the number and feeds it into Ultron. Hank shares the number with the rest of the Avengers and the way to decrypt it:   Divide the encrypted number ‘N’ by its biggest prime divisor. Now, divide the resultant number by its biggest prime divisor and continue the process (i.e., recursively) until the resultant number doesn’t have any prime divisors. The decrypted code is the number of times you have to do this process.   Hank wants you to decrypt the number for him, so that he may store it somewhere safe (maybe inside one of the books at the IIITD library).Can you help Hank?  Input First line contains ‘T’, the number of test cases. Each test case is given on a new line, which consists of a number the encrypted number 'N'.  Output For each test case, print the decrypted number.  Constraints Should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have. Format it like:  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^9   Example Input: 4 2 9 100 17  Output: 1 2 4 1    Explanation  For the first test case, 2 has no prime divisors apart from itself. So, the answer is 1. For the second test case, 9 has 3 as the only prime divisor. Dividing it by 3, we get 3.Dividing 3 by itself, we get 1, which has no prime divisors. So, the answer is 2. For the third test case, the largest prime divisor is 5. Dividing, we get 20.The largest prime factor of 20 is 5. So, dividing by 5, we get 4. The largest prime factor of 4 is 2. Dividing, we get 2. Again dividing 2 by 2, we stop at 1.So, we did the division 4 times. Hence, the answer is 4. The fourth test case is similar to the first test case.  
 Gordon breathed heavily. "We can't take a chance. This is our only hope." Hiding under the shadow of Wayne Tower, he and Lucius Fox looked over the hordes of prisoners being released from Blackgate Penitentiary. They were arming up to attack downtown. "They need to cross the Riverwaith Bridge. Due to the damage we caused to it, they can only cross it in a single file. We must use this opportunity to cripple them." said Fox. "I have my undercover officers ready. They have already infiltrated the prisoners." "Hmm, we better give them instructions to position them in the file. I suggest we place the officers such that we keep the prisoners most separated. This will give us a strategic advantage when we strike." Input: First line: one number t , indicating number of test cases  t < 10^6 Next t lines: two space separated numbers indicating the number of prisoners (p) and the number of undercover cops (c). 0<=c<=p<=10^9 Output: A single number (for each test case) ,which tells us the minimum possible consecutive prisoners in the single file, after optimally placing the undercover cops. Sample Input: 3 15 4 15 15 15 0 Sample Output: 3 1 15   
Guru Prakash has recently discovered his sweet heart's (let's call her SH) secret affairs. He was amazed by the number of people one could have an affair with simultaneously. But after delving deeper into the issue he found out that SH has a pattern in her number of affairs she maintains at any point of time. Guru conjectures that at any point in time, the number of affairs SH has is always of the form "a power b"(suprising!). This conjecture is further strengthened by the fact that SH stalks a lot and is always bound to have lots of affairs. Your task is simple. You have to verify if Guru's conjecture is true. In other words, whenever Guru reports the current number of boyfriends SH is having, you have to report if its of the form a^b(both a,b ≥2)  Input Input description.  Every input contains a single integer n (2<=n<=10^16)   The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. Each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of boyfriends SH currently has an affair with.     Output Output description. For each test case, output a single line containing "YES" if its of the form a^b. "NO" otherwise. Quotes given for clarity. Note that a,b ≥2    Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10000 2 ≤ N ≤ 10^16     Example Input: 5 2 3 4 5 6  Output: NO NO YES NO NO     Explanation Example case 1. 2 is not of the form a^b Example case 3. 4 is of the form 2^2 
Arithmetic and geometric Progressions are 2 of the well known progressions in maths. Arithmetic progression (AP) is a set in which the difference between 2 numbers in constant. for eg, 1,3,5,7,9....In this series the difference between 2 numbers is 2.The task here is very simple indeed. You will be given the 3rd term , 3rd last term and the sum of the series. You need to print the length of the series & the series itself.    Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines will have 3 number '3rd term' ,'3rd Last term' and 'sum'.  3rd term  - is the 3rd term in the series 3rd Last term  - is the 3rd term from the end in the series sum - is the sum of the series.       Output For each input of the test case, you need to print 2 lines.  First line should have 1 value-number of terms in the series. 2nd line of the output should print the series numbers separated by single spaces.     Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 All numbers will be less than 10^16. The series will have at least 7 elements. In all the test cases all the series elements are positive integers.     Example Input: 1 3 8 55  Output: 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10   
You a given a tree consisting of N nodes, and a set of Q queries. Each query consists of a pair of nodes (u, v). For each query, find the number of nodes r, such that when you root the tree at r, either u is an ancestor of v, or v is an ancestor of u.  Input  The first line consists of two integers:N and Q. The next N-1 lines consist of 2 integers each: u and v, each describing an edge. The next Q lines consist of 2 integers each: u and v, each describing a query pair (u, v).   Output For each query, output the required answer on a separate line.   Constraints  N, Q <= 10^5 0 <= u, v < N The given graph is a tree For each query pair u, v; u != v     Example Input: 5 5 0 1 1 2 1 3 0 4 4 3 4 1 0 1 0 2 1 2  Output: 2 4 5 3 5   
Oh my God!!! Someone is trying to break into Thapar University's Database and steal sensitive research information. It is now up to us to stop this attack. Fortunately our defense mechanisms have traced the attacks to their source. The fastest way to stop the attacks is to disable the source. So all we need to do is to teach that guy a lesson, by planting a virus in his own system. But before we can do that, we need to break through all the layers of the security he has put around himself. Our sources tell us that the first layer is based on ASCII encryption. We must penetrate through this layer as fast as we can to reach the source...   Input:  The first line will consist of the total number of test cases T. The next T lines will consist of one string on each line.The length of the string should be greater than 2.   Output:  For each test case, output is a single character.    Example: Input:  3 abcd reverse gear    Output:  b m g   
Breaking through the first layer has definitely weakened the hacker, for his attacks are becoming less frequent now. But he may be preparing for something bigger and worse in the meantime. It is essential to break through all the layers as soon as possible. The next layer seems to have a more complex architecture, possibly based on a mathematical foundation.  It is rumoured that the hacker is a huge follower of a great Italian mathematician. You must find a way to break through this next layer...   Input:  The first line will consist of the total number of test cases T. The next T lines will consist of number N on each line.(101 ≤ N ≤ 10000000)   Output:  For each test case, output is a number.    Example: Input:  3 105 675 3254    Output:  1 3 5   
We are very near to our goal now. The enemy is being weakened continuously. But alas, sensing his fall, the hacker has spread a worm into our network. It is consuming all our files at a tremendous rate and must be stopped at all costs. The only way to stop it is to enter a specific code number in to the worm. It is up to you to find an algorithm for the worm's stop code...Time is of the essence, my friend...   Input:  The first line will consist of the total number of test cases T. The next T lines will consist of number N on each line.   Output:  For each test case, output is a number.    Example: Input:  3 34 156 893    Output:  6 0 13   
Now that we have recovered all our data, we can return to hacking in to the hacker's system. Our sources tell us that this hacker's lust for power is so great that it is reflected in everything he does, everything he creates. Perhaps this knowledge can become his weakness in our hands, his thirst for power laying a trap for him. News also arrives of a great weapon being developed by him, soon to be unleashed upon us. Can you break through the next level of his security and disable the cyber weapon while there is still time?   Input:  The first line will consist of the total number of test cases T. The next T lines will consist of one string on each line.   Output:  For each test case, output is a number.    Example: Input:  3 aranya reverse gear    Output:  124 252 159   
At last, we have successfully neutralized all the cyber weapons of mass destruction, saved our university along the way and lay to waste another evil scheme in the process. All that separates that hacker from us now is his last lair of security, his ultimate firewall. It is imperative for us to break through this last line of defense and punish the one responsible for all this loss. Breaking this firewall shall be no easy task, but we aren't letting go either. Shift your gears in reverse and get cracking.   Input:  TThe first line will consist of the total number of test cases T. The next T lines will consist of number N on each line where 1 ≤ N ≤ 100.    Output: For each test case, output is a number.    Example: Input:  3 2 12 44    Output:  8 96 11264

Darshit enters his classroom to discover his Professor Shastri shouting at the top of his voice, and the entire class in commotion. He soon realizes what's wrong.  Someone broke a canister of Deodorant in the class, and Prof. Shastri will do anything to break his bones.  Since no one knows who really did it, and it was probably done by someone from outside the class, the students decide to play a game. The loser of that game would have to own up to Prof. Shastri. This wouldn't be a problem if Darshit wasn't on the defaulters list. But he was, and under no circumstances could own up to this messy situation. Help Darshit figure out exactly which person would be the loser in this game.    The game All the students would sit on their seats, and their names would be written in a list. Then, one by one, names would be struck off the list. A number between 1 and 5 would be chosen, and the striking would proceed based on that number. The second last person to be struck off the list would have to own up to Prof. Shastri  This would've been easy if people still had to sit, but most of the class had already picked their seats!   Note There will be total 5 sample inputs given to your program. All input values lie between 0 and 120.   Sample Assuming a class of 7 students And a random number 3, striking would proceed as follows: 3,6,2,7,5,1,4  Thus, the first person in the original list of names would be the loser.   Example Input (Number of namesXRandom Number)  7X3 5X4 6X5 9X2 3X5  Example Output 1 2 4 7 3 
 Farhan has a standard football that is made of 32 pieces of leather: 12 black pentagons and 20 white hexagons. Each pentagon adjoins 5 hexagons and each hexagon adjoins 3 pentagons and 3 hexagons. Farhan drew a polygon (i.e. a closed line without intersections) along the edges of the pieces. The polygon divided the ball into two parts and Farhan painted one of them green.    He is curious if given a description of the polygon you are able to compute the number of black, white and green pieces?   Task Write a program that:   reads the description of a polygon  computes the number of black, white and green pieces  writes the result    Input  The input has two test cases.  For each test case, the first line of the input contains one integer n being the number of vertices of the polygon. The second line of the input contains n integers a1, a2,..., an separated by single spaces. Integer ai (equal 1 or 2) is the number of green pieces adjoining the i-th vertex of the polygon. The side of the polygon connecting the n-th and the first vertex always lies between two hexagons.  Output  For each test case the first and only line of the output contains three integers b, w and g - the numbers of black, white and green pieces respectively.   Example Sample input: 21 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 1 1 1 21 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 1 1 1 Sample output: 11 15 6 11 15 6 
  Problem description. An arithmetic progression(AP) is a sequence of numbers such that the difference of any two successive members of the sequence is a constant. For example:- 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, ... A geometric progression(GP) is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed non-zero contant. For examplee:- 1, 3, 9, 81, ... (with common ratio of 3). Given three successive members of a sequence, you need to determine the type of the progression and the next successive member.    Input  Each case is specified on a single line with three integers a1, a2, a3 are distinct. The last case is followed by a line with three zeros.  Output  For each test case, your program must print a single line of the form: XX v where XX is either AP or GP depending if the given progression is an Arithmetic or Geometric Progression. v is the next member of the given sequence. All input cases are guaranteed to be either an arithmetic or geometric progressions.  Constraints    Example Input: 4 7 10 2 6 18 0 0 0 Output: AP 13 GP 54 
Dhapu loves programming. So naturally she loves the language of ones and zeroes. She has created a function bitcount(x) which returns the number of set bits in the binary representation of the number 'x'. She would love to stress test her program's performance. She feeds it with queries consisting of 2 integers - l and r. The objective of her program is to find the number 'x' (between l and r, inclusive) such that bitcount(x) is maximum possible. And if there exist multiple such numbers, she wants to print the smallest one. She wants to check if her results are right. Can you make the same program as she did?  Input Format:- The first line contains integer n — the number of queries Each of the following n lines contain two integers l and r.  Output Format:- For every query, print the answer to the problem.  Constraints:- 1 <= n <= 1000  0 <= l <= r <= 10^18 
  Problem description. Dhapu has been reading about communication systems which interests her a lot. There she noticed a peculiar way to measure distance/error between 2 signals called the Hamming Distance. Till now she only knew of Euclidean Distance between 2 points. On searching online, she read the following on Wikipedia:- In information theory, the Hamming distance between two strings of equal length is the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols are different. In another way, it measures the minimum number of substitutions required to change one string into the other, or the minimum number of errors that could have transformed one string into the other. If the length of strings differ, we consider that the Hamming Distance cannot be found out. She wants to see if she has understood the concept clearly. So, she decides to write a program that will find the Hamming Distance between 2 signals. Can you help her?    Input  First line of the input contains the number of test cases T. T test cases follow. Each test case consists of the 2 strings, each on a separate line.   Output For every test case, print the Hamming Distance between the 2 strings. If it doesn't exist, print -1.   Constraints  1 <= T <= 1000 1 <= Length of Signals <= 1000 Strings will consist of only alphabets and numerical digits. Note:- A signal can be represented as a string of characters. Upper case and Lower Case alphabets represent different characters.

  Problem description Yalin has a little sister whom he loves very much. On her birthday, he decides to give her a special dictionary made up of words using just a few alphabets which appear in an odd order. Thinking she will love the gift as much as he did, he gifts it to her. But unfortunately, she doesn't like it at all. She wanted the book "The C Programming Language by Brian Kernighan & Dennis Ritchie". Angered by this, he throws away the dictionary and all the words fell off the book. His little sister starts crying and now demands to know which word appeared where.  Can you help Yalin calm his little sister down on her own birthday?  Note: The dictionary contained only 7 letters in the order - d, h, a, p, u, s, v  Input Format:- First line of the input contains the number of test cases T. T lines follow, each containing an integer. Each line contains the place N of the word Yalin's sister wants to know.  Output Format:- For every test case, print the word that comes at the Nth place.  Constraints:- 1 <= T <= 100 1 <= N <= 10^18  Example:-  Input:-  3  1  2  10  Output:-  d  h  da   
Chef's encounters with sweets continue with this problem! This time, he wants to distribute chocolates to his N students sitting on a long bench. The students are ordered according to the scores they got from the last exam. Chef wants to give more chocolates to the higher-scoring students. He also has a few more restrictions. Here are all the restrictions:  Every student must get at least one chocolate bar. If i < j, then the i^th student gets strictly fewer chocolate bars than the j^th student. The difference between the number of chocolate bars of any two adjacent students must be the same.  Chef has exactly C chocolate bars, and he doesn't want leftovers so every chocolate bar must be given to some student. Is it possible for Chef to finish this task?  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. Each test case consists of a single line containing two space separated integers N and C.  Output For each test case, output a single line containing either “Yes” or “No” (without quotes), denoting whether Chef can accomplish the task or not.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^9 1 ≤ C ≤ 10^18   Example Input: 2 4 24 2 2  Output: Yes No  Explanation Example case 1. In this case, Chef can accomplish the task by giving 3, 5, 7 and 9 chocolate bars to the students. Example case 2. There are 2 students. The first one must get at least 1 chocolate bar. The second one must get strictly more than that, so he/she must get at least 2 chocolate bars. Thus, Chef needs at least 3 chocolate bars. But he only has 2, so the task is impossible. 
  There are two integer arrays: A and B having a size N where N<=1000. You are free to permute the order of the elements in the arrays.   Main problem: Among all the arrangements of the two arrays, is there any case such that Ai+Bi ≥ K for all i where Ai denotes the i^th element in the array A.     Input The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test-cases. T test cases follow. Each test case is given in the following format.   The first line contains two integers, N and K. The second line contains N integers separated by a single space, denoting A array. The third line describes B array in a same format.   Output For each test case, if there is such arrangement exists output YES, otherwise NO.  Constraints 1 <= T <= 10   1 <= N <= 1000   1 <= K <= 10^9   0 <= Ai, Bi <= 10^9   Example Input: 2 3 10 2 1 3 7 8 9 4 5 1 2 2 1 3 3 3 4  Output: YES NO    Explanation The first input has 3 elements in Array A and Array B, we see that the one of the arrangements, 3 2 1 and 7 8 9 has each pair of elements (3+7, 2 + 8 and 9 + 1) summing upto 10 and hence the answer is YES. The second input has B array with three 3s. So, we need at least three numbers in A to be greater than 1. As its not the case, the answer is NO.  
Hermione Granger, the most talented witch of her generation, likes to solve various types of mathematical problems in the Arithmancy class. Today, the professor has given her the following task:  Find the number of fractions a/b such that-  1.	gcd(a, b) = 1 2.	0 < a/b < 1 3.	a * b = (n!) ^ (n!)  Where "n!" denotes the factorial of n and "^" denotes power, i.e. (2!) ^ (2!) = 4.  She is quite confident that she can solve it for n <= 10,000,000 (i.e. 10^7), but then she remembers that she has to study some case history so that she can help Hagrid to win the case of Buckbeak. So, she wants your help to solve the problem.   Input There will be one line for each test case containing the number n (1 <= n <= 10,000,000). Input will be terminated by EOF. There will be around 20,000 test cases.   Output For each case, print the number of fractions in a separate line. This number may be very large, so print the answer modulo 10,007.   Example  Input: 1 2  Output: 0 1 
Asya is not only cute but smart and her young age doesn't stop her from learning different algorithms. These days she is busy in developing an application for communication over a network. Now she needs your help in writing a small program. Your are given the message received by a node on network, R. The message is in binary. The network designed by Asya is pretty awesome. It is assured that at maximum a single bit error can occur in the original message (M). To detect this, the original message is transformed to Encoded message (E). The message is transformed as follows : 1> Blank spaces are inserted (from left) at all positions which are 2^i where i = 0, 1, 2, 3,... 2> At any blank space at position 2^i, the value given is : (sum of all the bits at position x, where i-th bit (from LSB) is set in x) MOD 2. for example; if M = 111110001100 then, inserting blank spaces : _ _ 1 _ 1 1 1 _ 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 _ 0 Blank spaces are at 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 th positions. Now value at position 1 : (sum of bits at position 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17) % 2 						= (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0) % 2 						= 5 % 2 						= 1 value at position 2		: (sum of bits at position 3, 6, 7, 10, 11, 14, 15) % 2 						= (1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0) % 2 						= 4 % 2 						= 0 value at position 4		: (sum of bits at position 5, 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 15) % 2 						= (1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0) % 2 						= 5 % 2 						= 1 value at position 8		: (sum of bits at position 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15) % 2 						= (1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0) % 2 						= 3 % 2 						= 1 value at position 16	: (sum of bits at position 17) % 2 						= 0 % 2 						= 0 So, E = 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 This message E is sent over the network. Now she wants you to write the code to output the correct original message (M), when the input is received message (R). (i.e, you have to develop the decoding algorithm).  Input :  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. Every test case contains a binary string, denoting the received message (R).     Output :  For each test case, output a single line containing the original message (M).     Constraints :  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 3 ≤ |R| ≤ 100000     Example : Input: 2 10111111101011000 110  Output: 111110001100 1    Explanation : Example case 1. R = 10111111101011000 So, E = 10111111100011000 and thus, M = 111110001100  
 Asya is a very intelligent girl and she comes up with very fascinating games to entertain herself. On her b'day she got gifts from Uncle Sai. He gifted her M marbles and a tree with N nodes with each edge of 1-unit length. Asya could keep M marbles in the nodes of the tree and then see them roll from one node to some other node where the marble stops. A marble always ends at some other node than what it started from. After playing a while Asya got bored and thought of making it a lil more interesting. She took her color box and painted every marble differently (with distinct colors). After this she placed these marbles in the tree nodes. Some tree nodes might be empty and some tree nodes may have more than one marble. The marbles then started rolling, painting the edges of the tree. Asya calls an edge beautiful if that edge is colored by all the M colors. Given the tree and initial arrangement of the marbles in the tree and the fact that a marble can end at any other node with equal probability, can you tell Asya the expected value of total length of beautiful edges.   Input :  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of nodes in the tree. N-1 lines follow, each containing two space separated integers, X and Y denoting an edge between node X and Y. The last line of every test case contains N space separated integers, denoting number of marbles at i-th node.     Output :  For each test case, output a single line containing the expected value of total length of beautiful edges. The answer with absolute or relative error no more than 10^-6 will be accepted.     Constraints :  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 3 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ M ≤ 10^2 0 ≤ Node number < N     Example Input: 1 3 0 1 1 2 1 0 1  Output: 1.0000    Explanation Example case 1. There are four possible cases :  Case 1 : Marble at node 0 stops at node 1 and marble at node 2 stops at node 1. In this case there is no beautiful edge. Case 2 : Marble at node 0 stops at node 2 and marble at node 2 stops at node 1. In this case the total length of beautiful edges is 1, (edge between node 1 and node 0). Case 3 : Marble at node 0 stops at node 1 and marble at node 2 stops at node 0. In this case the total length of beautiful edges is 1, (edge between node 0 and node 1). Case 3 : Marble at node 0 stops at node 2 and marble at node 2 stops at node 0. In this case the total length of beautiful edges is 2, (both the edges). So, the final answer is (1/4)*0 + (1/4)*1 + (1/4)*1 + (1/4)*2 = 1  Note : Use of fast I/O is recommended 
 ACM International Collegiate     Programming Contest, Asia-Amritapuri Site, 2012 Gandalf vs the Balrog  'We fought far under the living earth, where time is not counted. Ever he clutched me, and ever I hewed him, till at last he fled into dark tunnels.     Ever up now we went, until we came to the Endless Stair. Out he sprang, and even as I came behind, he burst into new flame.     Those that looked up from afar thought that the mountain was crowned with storm.     Thunder they heard, and lightning, they said, smote upon Celebdil, and leaped back broken into tongues of fire.' - Gandalf, describing his fight against the Balrog.  Although Gandalf would not go into the details of his battle, they can be summarized into the following simplified form: both Gandalf and the Balrog have a set of N attacks they can use (spells, swords, brute-force strength etc.). These attacks are numbered from 1 to N in increasing order of Power. When each has chosen an attack, in general, the one with the higher power wins. However, there are a few ("M") anomalous pairs of attacks, in which the lesser-powered attack wins.  Initially, Gandalf picks an attack. Then the Balrog counters it with one of the remaining attacks. If the Balrog's counter does not defeat Gandalf's, then we say Gandalf receives a score of 2. If however it does, then Gandalf has exactly one more opportunity to pick an attack that will defeat the Balrog's. If he manages to defeat him now, his score will be 1, whereas if he is still unable to defeat him, his score will be 0.  Your task is to determine, given N and the M anomalous pairs of attacks, what will be Gandalf's score, given that both play optimally. Further, in case Gandalf gets a score of 2, you must also determine which attack he could have chosen as his first choice.  Note 1: The Balrog can choose only one attack, whereas Gandalf can choose upto two. Note 2: The relation A defeats B is not transitive within the attacks. For example, attack A can defeat attack B, attack B can defeat attack C, and attack C can defeat attack A. Note 3: Between any two attacks A and B, either attack A defeats attack B or attack B defeats attack A.  Input (STDIN):  The first line will consist of the integer T, the number of test-cases. Each test case begins with a single line containing two integers N and M. This is followed by M lines consisting of 2 integers each x and y, denoting that x and y are an anomalous pair.  Output (STDOUT):  For each test-case, output a single line either 2 A, if Gandalf can defeat any attack the Balrog chooses if he picks attack A, 1, if Gandalf can choose an attack such that even if the Balrog chooses an attack to defeat him, he can choose an attack to defeat the Balrog's chosen one, 0, if none of the above two options are possible for all possible choices of Gandalf's attack(s). Between successive test cases, there should not be any blank lines in the output.  Constraints:  1 <= T <= 15 3 <= N <= 1,000,000 0 <= M <= min(N(N-1)/2, 300,000) 1 <= x < y <= N for all the anomalous pairs (x,y) The sum of M over all test-cases will not exceed 300,000.  Sample Input:   2 3 0 3 1 1 3  Sample Output:   2 3 1  Notes/Explanation of Sample Input:  In the first case, attack 3 can beat both attacks 1 and 2. So Gandalf just chooses attack 3. In the second case, attack 1 beats 3 which beats 2 which beats 1. No matter which attack Gandalf chooses, the Balrog can pick the one which defeats his, but then he can pick the remaining attack and defeat the Balrog's. 
  Problem description.  Pooja would like to withdraw X $US from an ATM. The cash machine will only accept the transaction if X is a multiple of 5, and Pooja's account balance has enough cash to perform the withdrawal transaction (including bank charges). For each successful withdrawal the bank charges 0.50 $US. Calculate Pooja's account balance after an attempted transaction.  Input Positive integer 0 < X <= 2000 - the amount of cash which Pooja wishes to withdraw. Nonnegative number 0<= Y <= 2000 with two digits of precision - Pooja's initial account balance.  Output Output the account balance after the attempted transaction, given as a number with two digits of precision. If there is not enough money in the account to complete the transaction, output the current bank balance.  Example - Successful Transaction. Input: 30 120.00  Output: 89.50  Example - Incorrect Withdrawal Amount (not multiple of 5) Input: 42 120.00  Output: 120.00  Example - Insufficient Funds Input: 300 120.00  Output: 120.00 
   Mr. Yagami is a scientist in the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre. They are   conducting a lab experiment on nuclear fission. In nuclear fission, one atom   breaks into more than one atom of the same type.    Initially, there are N atoms in the lab. Starting from now (t=0), after each   second, every atom will break into K atoms of the same type. They don’t want   the number of atoms to exceed M, so they have to stop the reaction at some   time t=T. Can you find this value T for Mr. Yagami.   Input Format:    First line contains P, the number of test cases. Next P lines contain three   integers each. These three integers represent the values of N, K and M   respectively.   Output Format:    For each test case print the time at which the reaction will have to be   stopped.   Constraints:     1 ≤ P ≤ 10^4   2 ≤ N, K, M ≤ 10^18    Sample Input:  2 2 2 7 2 2 8 Sample Output:  1 2 Explanation:    1st test case:   at t=1, number of atoms=4   at t=2, number of atoms will be 8.   So reaction has to be stopped at t=1.   2nd test case:   at t=1, number of atoms=4   at t=2, number of atoms will be 8.   at t=3, number of atoms will be 16.   Problem Setter: Lalit Kundu

But he is really disappointed with the behavior of the contestants as they are not very willing to do class or learn new things .  So he decided to set a  problem on new topic in Intra AUST Programming contest that they will learn this topic through reading the problem statement . We asked him about the problem and fortunately he shared his problem with us .    Euler circuit is a path that starts from any node ,  uses every edge of a graph exactly once and then finishes at same starting node .  In this Problem there is given a graph with ‘V’ vertexes and ‘E’ edges .  Your task is to find there exists a euler circuit  or not . If so then print “Yes” otherwise print “No” .    Algorithm to detect Euler Circuit  :  Graph should be connected Degree of every vertex should be even . Degree of a vertex means total incoming and outgoing edge of a vertex .   Input Input starts with an integer T ( 1 <= 30 ) , number of test cases . Each test case consists of two integer n ( 1 <= n <= 500 ) and m ( 1 <= m <= 10000 ) where n is the number of nodes and m is number of edges between these nodes .

  Your friend Ayman has started a course for learning to play guitar. The instructor introduces him the basic functionality of guitar. The fret board is the element where guitar strings are placed on it. The fret board has been assigned some numbers for denoting each of the fret.  Number 1 to 12 has been assigned for numbering each of the fret. The picture will help you understand.  Besides, there are six strings which are denoted by E, B, G, D, A, E (from top to bottom) in standard tuning. Finding particular note for the particular fret position and string is very important. There are basically 12 important notes. The followings are the notes which maintain the ordering:   The note continues circularly. That means after the B there will be C, C#, D . . . .  etc. For each fret of a particular string the notes follow the above ordering. For example, considering the E string (1st String), in the first fret it will have the note F, then for the second fret is F#, for the third is G and it maintains above pattern of the chart up-to fret 12.   Your friend, Ayman becomes confused finding out the note. Can you assist him to find out the particular fret note of a given string?  Input First of all there will be T test cases.  For each of the test case, there will be two integer value  f (1<=f<=12) and s (1<=s<=6) , were f denotes the position of the fret and s denotes the string number (here, the strings are numbered 1 to 6 from top to bottom)  Output For each test case, print a line “Case x: y” where x is replaced by the test case number and y is replaced by the note of that particular fret for that particular guitar string.  Example Input: 5 1	1 4	2 12	3 8	4 8	6    Output:  Case 1: F Case 2: D# Case 3: G Case 4: A# Case 5: C

   Michael Clarke is Secretary of the Australian Cricket Club. When the club gathers together, the players behave badly due to their bad performance in the Cricket World Cup 2015. They've brought lots of ropes to the club and got tied with each other. Specifically, each rope ties together two players. Also, if two players are tied together, then the rope connects the first player with the second one as well as the second player with the first one.     As Captain Clarke is already angry at their bad performance, this scenario got him more angrier. In his anger and frustration, Clarke does the following. First, for each player, Clarke finds out what other players he is tied to. If a player is tied to exactly one other player, Clarke reprimands him. Then Clarke gathers in a single group all the players who have been just reprimanded. He then throws them out from the club. This group of players immediately leaves the club. These players takes with them the ropes that used to tie them. Then again for every players Clarke finds out how many other players he is tied to and so on. And they do so until Clarke can reprimand at least one player. He doesn't even care if the club gets empty in the process.   Determine how many groups of players will be thrown out of the club.   Input The first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases are follow The first line contains two integers n and m — the initial number of players and ropes. The players are numbered from 1 to n, and the ropes are numbered from 1 to m. Next m lines each contain two integers a and b — the numbers of players tied by the i-th rope (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n, a ≠ b). It is guaranteed that no two players are tied with more than one rope. No rope ties a player to himself.   Output Print the single number — the number of groups of players that will be thrown out from the club.  Constraints 1 <= n <= 1000 <= m <= (n*(n-1))/2 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n, a ≠ b  Example Input: 1 3 3 1 2 2 3 3 1  Output: 0   Input: 1 6 3 1 2 2 3 3 4  Output: 2  Input: 1 6 5 1 4 2 4 3 4 5 4 6 4  Output: 1   Explanation Case 1: In this case, Clarke won't throw out any group of players — in the initial position every player is tied to two other players and Clarke won't be able to reprimand anyone. Case 2: In this case, four players are tied in a chain and two more are running by themselves. First Clarke throw out the two players from both ends of the chain (1 and 4), then — two other players from the chain (2 and 3). At that the players who are running by themselves will stay in the club. Case 3: In the third sample, Clarke will momentarily kick out all players except for the fourth one and the process stops at that point. The correct answer is one.  
  Fahim is going to make a social network which is now under construction. There are two ways to make friends in social network.  Type 1: Any person goes to his / her friend list then choose a friend and search his / her friend list (this website is under construction so friend list is public). From there he can choose a person and give him/her a friend request or go to his / her friend list and repeat this.  Type 2: Search a random user by typing his / her name and give him / her friend request.  Now Fahim wants a track of friendships formed by  Type 1  and  Type 2. When two people become friends, check whether it is possible by Type 1 method. If yes, then report “Found in friend list” otherwise report “Found by random”. As he is lazy, he is asking your help to do this job.   Input The first line contains  Query Q (Q <= 100000). Next Q line contains two names who become friends  A, B. A  sends  B  a friend request.  0 < Length of each name <= 10  0 < Sum of length of all names <= 1000000  Output Output for each query in a separate line, print “Found in friend list” if it is possible in  Type 1  method otherwise print  “Found by random”..  Example Input: 3 A B A C B C    Output:  Found by random Found by random Found in friend list   
The aliens of Pandora have multiple avatars(incarnations). They can change from one avatar to another. But in doing so they suffer from varied amount of memory loss. Detailed study by alien scientists revealed that this memory loss is related to the extent of genetic variations between the avatars. Each of the avatar have a characteristic genetic makeup which comprises of 26 nucleotides denoted by a,b,c,...x,y,z(thus proving their superiority to humans which have just lesser number of nucleotides). The memory loss is inversely related to the length of the maximum continuous common portion of their genetic sequence before and after their transformation into the new avatar. Considering this task as a trivial one the alien scientists have decided to assign this work of finding the maximum continuous common portion of the genetic sequences to junior aliens. Help the junior aliens in solving the problem and thus befriend them.   Input The first line of the input contains a space separated two integers N and M denoting the lengths of the two genetic sequences. Each of the next two lines contain the genetic sequence of an avatar.    Output A number denoting the maximum continuous common portion of the genetic sequence of the two avatars so as to minimize the memory loss.   Test Data: The maximum size of the genetic sequence is 75.   Input: 15 20 qasfdthegdtghas hsydgetdgsfarsfthegt  Output: 4

Bob fell in love with LCM and GCD. So much that he started seeing LCMs and GCDs everywhere. Betty, his girl friend was jealous and she gave Bob an array A[ ] of integers, which had nothing to do with LCMs or GCDs. Quickly, naughty Bob evaluated a new array B[ ] containing n integers, such that B[i] is LCM(1,2,3,...,A[i]), if A[i]>0. When A[i] is 0, B[i] is also 0. Angry Betty decided to give m queries to Bob, each being one of the following type: -   "0 i j p", meaning add 'p' to each element in A[i..j]. ( -300000 ≤ p ≤ 300000) -   "1 i j"    , meaning print the LCM of all elements in B[i..j]. 0 ≤ i -   "2 i j"    , meaning print the GCD of all elements in B[i..j].0 ≤ i  Input First line contains n(n ≤ 100000 ) and m( m ≤ 35000 ). Second line contains n integers in the original array A[ ] . Next m lines contain one of the above said queries. It is guaranteed that A[i] after any number of updates will satisfy 0 ≤ A[i] ≤ 300000.  Output Output one line for each query of type 1 or 2, modulo 1000000007.  Example  Input: 5 5 4 1 3 6 2 1 2 4 2 1 3 0 0 3 2 1 1 2 2 2 4   Output: 60 1 60 2  
Flibonakki series G(n) is defined as             G(n) = G(n-1) + f(4n-1)   , for n > 0  and    G(0) = 0  f(i) is our good old Fibonacci series. Given n you need to evaluate G(n).  Input First line contains number of test cases t (t    Output For each test case print the nth flibonakki number modulo 1000000007.  Example  Input: 2 2 4   Output: 15 714   
N ports are to be constructed on the bytelandian river. Since trade occurs only along a Y miles stretch of the river, the distance between the first and  the last port must be Y. To optimize the ship movement between important ports, the distance between any two consecutive ports has been fixed to be within a range of possible distances. Also, distance between two consecutive ports can only be an integer number of miles. As a programmer you have been assigned the job of evaluating the number of different possible arrangements of ports modulo 1000000007.  Input First line of input contains t. The number of test cases. (t First line of each test case contains two integers: N, the number of ports (N ≤ 20) and Y, the ditance between the first and the last port. (Y Next (N-1) lines of the test case contains the range of distances between consecutive ports, with ith line giving two integers, the minimum and maximum gap between (i-1)th and ith port.  Output Print one of output for each test case which is the number of possible arrangements modulo 1000000007.  Example  Input: 1 2 4 0 3 0 3   Output: 3  
Given an nxn grid of cells, a bacteria colony can colonize these cells. Their growth after every second is governed by the following rules:  1) One new bacteria is born in cell (i ,j) if and only if either one of its four neighboring cells or the cell(i,j) itself has a bacteria population more than or equal to the threshold value, k.  2) Already living bacterias do not die.  Given, the initial state of the nxn cell grid, you need to accurately estimate the time by when the total bacteria population reaches m.  Input First line contains t, number of test cases. Each test case starts with n (side length of grid ) , k (growth threshold) and m (final population). Next n lines contain an nxn grid of integers, where ith row,jth column tells the number of bacteria's present initially at cell(i,j).  1<  n ≤ 100 , 0<  k ≤ 2^45 , 0< m ≤ 2^45,  There are no more than n cells with initial population equal to or greater than k.   Output For each test case print the number of seconds required for the total bacteria population to reach m. If m can never be reached print "Not possible" (quotes for clarity).  Example  Input: 1  3 5 15  0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 5   Output: 3  
A group of N shoppers go to a supermarket. The supermarket has M items. Each shopper wants to buy only the items he likes. They plan to buy K items in all. A shopper can buy at max only one item. Some shoppers may not buy anything and some items might not be bought.  Input First line contains the number of test cases. Each test case contains three integers N , M and K separated by spaces. Then follow N lines containing M characters each. If jth character of ith line is 1 then ith shopper likes item j.  1 ≤ K ≤ N, M ≤13  Output For each test case, output the number of ways K items in all can be bought.  Example  Input: 1 4 4 2 1111 0100 0100 1100   Output: 14  
Godi and Abhik are two good friends. But then the day of Department elections came. They both knew that no one in the department is as jobless as they are to contest for the post of Secretary. They had specific set of skills with which they developed closed friends group for the past three years. People belonging to that group socialize with each other so they knew each other well. But when they both decided to go apart, the group split into two parts. And thereafter, no one from a group communicates with anyone from the opposite.   The department also has a set of students (say S) who don't mingle well with either of the groups. This is mainly because even though they like Godi or Abhik they don't want to mingle with everyone else in the respective groups. Godi and Abhik used their campaigning skills to attract as much crowd as possible from that set S. (They even supplied food to the student's door steps). Eshwar as greedy as always, thinks that if he pretends to support both Abhik and Godi, he can gain more. He has his own followers including Pradeep.   Subbu, the current secretary is tired of the cheap tricks played by the students belonging to the set S. He decides to conduct the elections as fairly as possible. So, he declares that "If and only if students belonging to the set S plan to support at-most one candidate, the elections can proceed". Obviously, he din't mean that all the students from the set S must support the same group. To check this, he prepares the list of connections between the students (by their ids). If a student is connected to a candidate (directly or indirectly) this implies he/she supports that candidate. But he later forgets the names of the students and just remembers the ids and the list of connections. So, he just checks whether he can construct a network where there is no one like Eshwar (who supports both the candidates) present in the final network. Some students like Spandana may be busy studying that they don't even know the elections are going on. Also there may be the case that no one is in the set S.  Subbu is perfectly fine with all these situations.  Now, Abhik and Godi are worried whether the elections will proceed or not. They seek your help, so that they can continue campaigning. Output "YES" if the elections will proceed, else print "NO".    Note that students from set S can support a candidate by connecting with at-least one of the students belonging to the closed group of that candidate(incl. the candidate itself). And also sometimes either Godi or Abhik or both can go missing from the list of connections. In that case we can assume that their closed group will also be missing. But it is not assured that they will have non-empty friends group if they are present. Hence, if either or both the candidates are missing then we can safely assume that elections can proceed(what a irony!)   Input Input description.  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers N, M. N denotes the number of students in the department and M denotes the number connections between them in the list prepared by Subbu. Then M lines follow. the ith line describes the ith connection. It contains two space separated integers u and v (u != v). u and v denotes the id of the students and they are 1-indexed.     Output Output description.  For each test case, output "YES" if elections can proceed else output "NO".(Quotes for clarity. Do not print them)     Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 20 2 ≤ N ≤ 500 1 ≤ M ≤ N*(N-1)/2     Example Input: 5 2 0  2 1 1 2  5 2 1 4 2 3  5 5 1 4 3 5 2 1 4 2 2 5  5 3 1 2 2 3 4 5  Output: YES YES YES NO YES    Explanation Example case 1. No one is connected. There can't be anyone like Eshwar planning to do the cheap trick.  Example case 2. Student 1 is connected to Student 2. Subbu can consider this a perfect network by assuming Student 1 as Abhik and Student 2 to be his friend. Or the same with Godi. He can also assume Student 1 is Abhik/Godi and Student 2 is from set S.   Warning  Input text files contains large I/O. Consider using faster I/O techniques.

 Pranay went to the sea shore and saw what looked like a treasure chest floating. Examining the locking mechanism, he immediately realized he came across a set of puzzles in FreakoMatix-Axis'10 to reward those who are skilled in the mathematical arts and punish those who are not. There were six dials of the digits 0 through 9 in the puzzle accompanied by a message : "You will be given two positive integers lesser than or equal to a billion. You need to tell the final 6 digits of raising the first to the power of the second". Pranay was overstruck with grief. With such huge numbers, the multiplications could take ages, but he had no more than a few seconds to give the right answer.   Input Input will consist of multiple lines, each containing two integers A and B (1 ≤ A, B ≤ 1000000000), separated by a space. A line containing two zeros signals the end of input and should not be processed.  Output For each line of input, print out the correct dial settings, i.e. the final six digits of A^B.  Example  Input: 421 1988 628 496 0 0   Output: 362161 493696

  Yesterday was Anish's birthday. The most interesting gift was definitely the chessboard. Anish quickly learned the rules of chess and started to beat all his peers.    That day night Anish was reading a Book on puzzles and Enigma. He opened the book somewhere in the middle and read the following problem: "How many knights can be placed on a chessboard without threatening each other?" After a while he realized that this was trivial and moved on to the next problem: "How many bishops can be placed on a chessboard without threatening each other?". Anish is in trouble here. He is not able to solve this problem and needs your help.    Anish's chessboard has size N x N. A bishop can move to any distance in any of the four diagonal directions. A bishop threatens another bishop if it can move to the other bishop's position. Your task is to compute the maximum number of bishops that can be placed on a chessboard in such a way that no two bishops threaten each other.   Input   The input file consists of several lines. The line number i contains a single number N representing the size of the i-th chessboard. [N ≤ 10^100]   Output   The output file should contain the same number of lines as the input file. The i-th line should contain one number - the maximum number of bishops that can be placed on i-th chessboard without threatening each other.   Example   Input  2  Output  2  
  Our college's best band VAPOUR SUNDAY is getting bigger and bigger by playing in many places, they rocked AAROHI09 and are a very famous band in the Central India, and the band's lead guitarist Karan kalanis music collection is getting bigger so he plans to write every bands songs into a CD and gave all of this job to his manager T Pramod. As the number of CDs increased, Pramod built his boss a shelf on which the CDs stand vertically. But Pramod now needs your help! he has written a title for each CD into a text file, but he needs the titles to appear vertically so that he can put them in the spine of the CD cases and be able to read them easily from the shelf. Pramod wants you to write a program that will output the titles vertically. He needs lines between each title so that, when he prints them, he can easily cut along the lines. He has worked out that he can fit 36 characters into the available space, so all output titles must be 36 characters long, padded with spaces at the end where necessary. If he accidentally makes a title too long, only output the first 36 characters.    CAN YOU HELP PRAMOD????   Input   Input will be at most 50 titles, one to a line. Each title consists of 1 to 100 arbitrary characters('A'-'Z', 'a'-'z', '0'-'9' and space are valid characters). A single `#' on a line by itself indicates the end of input.   Output   Output will be the same titles presented vertically, where the left to right order will be the same as the order of the input. There will be a column of bar (`|') characters at each end, and separating each title, and a row of minus (`-') characters (1 per column) at the beginning and end.

 ACM International Collegiate     Programming Contest, Asia-Amritapuri Site, 2012 Entmoot       'Hoo, ho! Good morning, Merry and Pippin!' he boomed, when he saw them. 'You sleep long. I have been many a hundred strides already today. Now we will have a drink, and go to Entmoot.'     'Where is Entmoot?' Pippin ventured to ask.     'Hoo, eh? Entmoot?' said Treebeard, turning round. 'It is not a place, it is a gathering of Ents - which does not often happen nowadays. But I have managed to make a fair number promise to come.'   Indeed, Entmoot cannot be thought of as any particular place, since where it occurs changes from time to time. The choice of the location however, follows a basic principle: Although the Ents (walking and talking Trees - "shepherds of Fangorn Forest") are by and large not hasty, when it comes to gathering for Entmoot, they would like to choose a location that ensures all the Ents can reach as soon as possible.  Note however, that the speed they can travel varies from Ent to Ent. Also, although Fangorn Forest has dense overgrowth, with regard to the Ents, the forest poses no obstacles.  You are given the locations of N Ents who have agreed to join in for Entmoot, as well as their speeds. You need to find out when Entmoot will occur. Formally, given the (x[i],y[i]) along with speed s[i] for each Ent, find the point (X, Y) such that the maximum time taken by any of the Ents to reach (X, Y) is minimized. Output the earliest time when all the Ents can meet.  Input (STDIN):  The first line contains T, the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains N, the number of Ents. The next N lines contain three space-separated integers each. The ith of these lines contains : x[i], y[i], s[i].  Output (STDOUT):  Output one line per test case, containing the earliest time when the Ents can meet. Relative and absolute error of 10^-4 are acceptable.  Constraints:  1 <= T <= 10 2 <= N <= 50 -1,000,000 <= x[i], y[i] <= 1,000,000 1 <= s[i] <= 1,000,000  Sample Input:   4 3 0 3 3 4 0 4 -3 -4 5 3 0 10 2 0 20 2 0 40 2 3 0 100 15 0 -100 15 8 0 7 3 0 0 1 10000 0 1 5000 8661 1  Sample Output:   1.000000 7.500000 6.666667 5773.751357  Notes/Explanation of Sample Input:  In the first test case, all the ents can meet at origin in 1 unit of time. In the second test case, the first and the third ent reach (25,0) after 7.5 units of ime, whereas the second ent reaches there after 2.5 units of time and waits for the remaining ents to arrive. In the third test case, all the ents can meet at origin in 100/15 units of time. 
Problem Description Now that the votes have been casted, its time to count them. The ballot box has been locked with a secret code and has been handled to the Election Commission for counting. The ballot box is very secure. It has 5 digits on its lock and only a particular combination of the digits can unlock it. The digits on the lock can be changed only with the help of a laser machine. The laser machine is very unique. It has K keys (with a number on each key) on it. In each step, it multiplies the 5 digit number on the ballot box with any of its keys and then takes the remainder with 10^5 so as to make the number back to 5 digits. Note that numbers are have leading 0's in case it is less than 5 digits. But using the laser machine is very expensive. Each step costs C Rupees. So the election commission wants to know the minimum cost to unlock the ballot box. Given the initial code, the final code (which unlocks the box), the K Keys and the cost per operation C, your job is to help find the minimum cost to unlock the box, or report that the box cannot be opened.  Input The first line of the input consists of the number of cases (T). T test cases follows. Each test case begins with a line containing 4 numbers K C I F, where K is the number of Keys on the laser, C is the cost of using laser once, I is a 5 digit initial code and F is a 5 digit final code to unlock. Next line contains K numbers, keys[] which are the keys on the laser machine. Output For each test case, output a line with one number which is the minimum cost to open the box. If the box can never be opened output -1 instead. Constraints  T ≤ 50 1 ≤ K ≤ 10 1 ≤ C ≤ 10^7 I, F are 5 digit numbers and can have leading zero's. 0 ≤ Keys[] ≤ 10^5 Sample Cases  2 2 10 00002 00016 2 4 2 10 00002 00001 2 4 Output  20 -1 Explanations  In the first case, you can use the key with number 2 to first reach to 4 and then use key 4 to reach 16. So laser was used two times. In the second case, whatever you multiply, you will never be able to reach an odd number.  
   Mr. Naughty likes to play with balls. So his friend, Mr Nice, gave him n   balls to play a game. Each ball has exactly two numbers (the number on the top   and the number on the bottom). In one move Mr Naughty can rotate any ball so   that its bottom now becomes the top. Mr Nice knows the minimum number of such   moves that can make at least half of the balls show same number on their top.   So to win Mr Nice's game, Mr Naughty should figure out the minimum number of   moves. Its not always possible to make such moves that satisfy the given   condition.In this case Mr Naughty should figure out that it is "Impossible" to   make such moves.   Help Mr Naughty to win the game.   Input Format:    The first line contains a single integer n - the number of balls. The   following n lines contain the description of all balls, one ball per line.   Each description has a pair of non-negative integers not exceeding 10^5 -   numbers on top and bottom. The first number in a line is the number on top,   the second one - on the bottom. The number on the top of the ball may be same   as the number on the bottom.   The numbers in the lines are separated by single spaces.   Output Format:    On a single line print a single integer - the minimum number of moves to win   the game. If it is impossible to make the set funny, print "Impossible"   (quotes for clarity).   Constraints:    1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5   Sample Input:  3 3 100 100 3 5 4 Sample Output:  1 Explanation:    In this case Mr Naughty can rotate the first ball so that number on the top   becomes 100. Since two of the three balls have same number on their top (100),   you do not need to change anything else, so the answer is 1.   Sample Input:  5 5 9 5 9 3 2 1 4 5 7 Sample Output:  0 Sample Input:  3 1 2 3 4 5 6 Sample Output:  Impossible Problem Setter: Prateek Sachdev 
A balanced prime is one which is the average of the previous and the next prime number. Your task in this problem is to write a program that can calculate the nth balanced prime  Input The first line of input contains t, the number of test cases.

 There is a bank which gives their customers a password 'only' for transactions(there is no username) via ATM. Also the ATM does not have any enter key, it automatically logs you into your account as soon as you enter the right password. There is a huge problem in such type of system,i.e., suppose that if two people A and B have “aadil” and “aadilahmad” as their passwords respectively, so whenever B will try to login, the machine will automatically login B into A’s account.   Input: 	First line of the input contains an integer N,the number of users in Bank. Next N lines contains strings which are passwords of the users. Tell if the bank is vulnerable or non-vulnerable.   Output: Print "vulnerable" if the bank is vulnerable or "non vulnerable" if the bank is not vulnerable.   Program constraints - N <= 10^5 All passwords consists of lower case english alphabets 1<=length of password<=50   Sample Input - 2 likemeifyoucan likeme   Sample Output - vulnerable  
 In numeral systems, the radix or base is the number of unique digits, including zero, that a numeral system uses to represent numbers. For example, for the decimal system (the most common system in use today) the radix is ten, because it uses the ten digits from 0 through 9. And hence, in such a number system 9 is followed by 10 , 11 and so on. Your task is to rite a program that converts a number from a radix 10 system to other system with a different radix.   Input  The first line will contain a single positive integer T denoting the number of lines following it. After the first line , T lines follow each containing two numbers N (0 ≤ N ≤ 1000). and D (2 ≤ D ≤ 9).Here D denotes the radix or base in which N is supposed to be converted.   Output  A set of T lines should be printed , each lines containing one number which is the converted form of N in the base D   Example  Input: 5 4 2 7 4 9 8 45 3 27 6 Output: 100 13 11 1200 43

This year at Utthaan, Miss West Bengal will be the Prime Judge of the Fashionista. All contestants are given an unique contestant number. The pre round of fashionista is done and the Miss West Bengal is confused about how many contestant to select for the finals, as all are equally talented. As she is a student of computer science and her teacher, Mr. Abhishek Sir, being very fond of coding, suggests her an unique way to decide how many contestant to select for the finals. She wants to select even number of participants, so that they can form a pair during the show. All contestants are standing in a row. Mr. Abhishek forms a string by appending the contestant numbers. Now he forms the longest sub-string whose sum of first half and the second half is same. The number of participants that will be going to the finals is the length of this sub-string.  You are given the string that is formed by appending the contestant numbers.  Input  First line has a number T, the number of test cases. Next T lines contents the appended sting.   Output Output the Number of contestants that will be selected for the finals.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ Length of string ≤ 10 ^3   Example Input: 1 0123213  Output: 6  Explanation From the appended string, 1+2+3=2+1+3. Hence the answer is 6. Note that Even number contestants are to be selected for the finals. 
A cricket team consists of 11 players and some are good at batting, others are good at bowling and some of them are good at both batting and bowling. The batting coach wants to select exactly K players having maximum possible sum of scores. Given the batting score of each of the 11 players, find the number of ways in which we can select exactly K players such that the sum of their scores is the maximum possible. Two ways are different if there is a player who is selected in one of them is not in the other. See explanation of sample cases for more clarity.   Input First line contains T, number of test cases ( 1 ≤ T ≤ 100 ). T cases follow, each having 2 lines. First line of each case contains scores of 11 players ( 1 ≤ score ≤ 100 ) and the second line contains K (1 ≤ K ≤ 11)   Output For each test case, output the answer in a new line.   Example  Input: 2 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 3 2 5 1 2 4 1 6 5 2 2 1 6  Output: 1 6   Explanation: Case 1 : Maximum possible sum of scores = 11 + 10 + 9 = 30 and can be achieved only by selecting the last 3 players. Only one possible way. Case 2 : Maximum possible sum of scores = 6 + 5 + 5 + 4 + 2 + 2 = 24 and considering the players as p1 p2 p3 ... p11 in that order, the ones with maximum possible sum of scores is as follows {p1, p2, p4, p5, p7, p8 } {p10, p2, p4, p5, p7, p8 } {p1, p2, p10, p5, p7, p8 } {p9, p2, p4, p5, p7, p8 } {p1, p2, p9, p5, p7, p8 } {p10, p2, p9, p5, p7, p8 } 
There are N participants in a chess competition. They are given unique ids, numbered from 1 to N. Every participant will play against every other participant in a game. Thus there will be (N*(N-1))/2 games in total. Assume none of the games result in a draw. A sponsor wants to meet all the players. But he can do so only one by one and in the following manner-  He can choose to meet any player at first. After meeting a player i, the next player he meets, say j, should be such that i defeated j.   Help him decide an order such that he is able to meet all the players. If there are multiple such orders, output the lexicographically smallest one. The games are such that if a defeats b, and b defeats c, then a defeats c. He doesn't want to meet any player more than once.   Input  First line contains integer t, the number of test cases. For each test case, first line contains integer N. Next N lines contain a string of 0 and 1 of length N, such that, if jth character of i^th line is 1, then i defeated j, otherwise j defeated i.

The end semester examinations have just been evaluated. The statisticians of the institute are not putting their brains to decide which class is the best of the college.  There are T classes in the college. Each class has exactly N students. The statisticians have decided that the best class is the one in which the difference between the maximum marks obtained and the minimum marks obtained is the least.  They have collected the data of each class. They now want you to calculate quickly the difference of maximum and minimum marks of each class.     Input The first line of input is T N separated by a space. Then T lines follows. Each line has exactly N integers denoting the marks obtained by the students of that class. All numbers are space separated.    Output For each class, output the difference between the maximum and the minimum marks.    Constraints T≤50 1≤N≤100 0 ≤ marks obtained by any student ≤100     Example Input: 2 5 2 4 5 1 3 0 100 90 80 70  Output: 4 100     Explanation Here there are 2 classes with 5 students each. Class 1. The maximum mark is 5 and the minimum is 1. Hence the difference is 5-1 =4. Class 2. The maximum mark is 100 and the minimum is 0. Hence the difference is 100-0 =100. Note: Do NOT ask for inputs by printing “Enter the value of N” etc. The judge is automated and will give you inputs automatically. Similarly, don’t write “The output is __”. Just print the result. 
  Sherlock is now taking a break from his current case and starts reviewing his famous case of "The N Orange Pips". He slips too deep into the case and gives you a puzzle.  Sherlock has N boxes consisting of orange pips. The ith box contains Ai orange pips. He now wants you to take out some pips from each box (you may leave some boxes untouched), such that in all the boxes the remaining number of pips is odd and equal to each other. Also, for each box, the number of pips present after the removal must be a factor of the original number of pips that were present in the box. You need to take as minimum number of pips as possible.  Now Sherlock asks you to tell the number of pips each box will have.  Input The first line consists of the number of boxes, N. N integers follow, each having a single integer, denoting the number of pips in each box.  Output A single integer denoting the number of pips each box will have.  Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ Ai < 2^63   Example Input: 4 98 42 14 28  Output: 7   
 "This is how I want you to remember me. The woman who beat you." ―Irene Adler   Irene Adler knows very well that if there is something Sherlock isn’t good at, it is with the Fibonacci Numbers. She throws him an open challenge. She wants Sherlock to find the number of different ways in which a number N could be represented as sum of Fibonacci numbers, without using K in the representation where K is also a Fibonacci number.  Two representations of a number N are same if the count of each distinct Fibonacci number in the representation is equal.   Sherlock now knows he is screwed. He doesn’t show it, but runs to Watson, that is you, for help. He wants you to help him out with this problem.   Note: The Fibonacci series does not include the number ‘0’. The series is (1,1,2,3,5,.....)  Input  First line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. T lines follow each containing two spaced integers N and K.   Output  For each test case, print the desired output modulo 10^9+7 in separate lines.   Constraints :  1 <= T <= 10^6  1 <= N <= 10^5  1 <= K <= N   Example : Input:  1  4 2   Output :  2    Explanation : The 2 possible solutions are (1,1,1,1) and (1,3).  
Sherlock has recently started playing DOTA - the most addictive strategy game of all time. His favorite attack in the game is the "LVL-Death" spell of a hero called Doom Bringer.  Every time he upgrades this spell the chance that it deals additional damage changes. Suppose K is the power of the spell, Sherlock noticed that the spell deals additional damage to enemy heroes whose level is NOT a K-Prime* number. An enemy hero's level can be between 1 and 10^7. *A K-Prime number is a positive integer that is not divisible by first K prime numbers.  Sherlock wanted to know how effective his spell can be. He wants to know the probability(as an irreducible fraction) of the spell with a power level of K dealing additional damage to an enemy hero whose level could be between L and R (both inclusive). Input First line will contain a number Q. Next Q lines will contain 3 space separated integers L, R and K Output Your output should contain exactly Q lines where i-th line is the answer to the i-th query. For every query print the required probability as an irreducible fraction of the form numerator/denominator.   Constraints  1 <= Q <= 10^5 1 <=L, R<=10^7  1 <=K <=10^6    Example Input: 3 1 10 1 1 20 5 10 20 3  Output: 1/2 4/5 7/11Explanation: For the first test case, the numbers {1,3,5,7,9} are not divisible by the first prime number(K=1) - 2 in the range between 1 and 10(L and R). Hence the probability is 5/10 = 1/2 Warning: Large I/O, be careful with certain languages.

 Problem description. The Pragyan Bot Contest is to design a bot to do the following task. You are given an initial configuration of board of M rows and N columns and a target board of M rows and N columns, where each tile is either Blue or Red. Blue is denoted as '1' and Red is denoted as '0'. Your task is to make the initial configuration on the board to look like the target board. The bot can do one of the following functions in each step :  Select a column Ci. For each tile in that column change the blue color tiles to red and vice-versa. It takes one time unit to do this. Select any two rows and swap them. This operation takes zero time units   Find the minimum number of time units taken to change the board to the given configuration.  Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers M and N. Then 2 lines follows where the first line contains M space-separated strings of 0's and 1's each of length N where the strings represents the configuration of M rows of the initial board. Then the next line contains M space-separated strings of 0's and 1's each of length N where the strings represents the configuration of M rows of the target board   Output  For each test case, output a single line containing the minimum time taken to match the boards. If it is not possible for the bot to match them, then output -1.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 150 1 ≤ M ≤ 150 1 ≤ N ≤ 50     Example Input: 1 2 3 110 001 000 111  Output: 1  Explanation For the first test case the robot can switch the 3rd column of the initial board and match it with the final board.

Aditya is playing a game with Dhivya. There is a weighing scale with 2 pans. There are also N weights numbered from 1 to N in a queue, owned by Dhivya. Aditya initially has no weights with him. Aditya processes the weights owned by Dhivya one-by-one. At any point of time, he weighs the weights that he owns against the next weight in queue. For example, if after 2 iterations, Aditya somehow owned the weights numbered 1 and 2 of weight 30 and 50 respectively, and the weights with Dhivya (numbered 3,4 and 5) are 90,80, and 100, then in the next iteration Aditya weighs his weights (30+50=80) against the next weight in queue (90). So in this iteration, Aditya loses to Dhivya Aditya does not want to lose to Dhivya in any iteration. That is, in every iteration, he always wants that the total weights with him outweighs the next weight in queue. In iterations when this is not possible, he pays Dhivya the amount for the next weight in queue and adds that weight to his collection; then both agree that Aditya won that iteration. He has the option to buy the next weight in queue from Dhivya, even if he can win that iteration. Obviously, he must buy the first weight, since initially he has no weights with him. Find out the minimum money he needs to spend such that he wins all the iterations.   Input The first line will contains the number of weights N, all of which are with Dhivya in the beginning. The subsequent N lines contain 2 integers each : the price for that weight (Pi) and the weight (Wi).   Output Print one integer - the minimum amount Aditya needs to pay to Dhivya.   Constraints 1<=N<=100 1<=Pi<=10 1<=Wi<=1,000,000,000   Example Input : 3 3 10 1 5 8 12 Output : 4 Explanation : Aditya has to buy the first weight (total sum payable = 3). He can win the next iteration, but then he will have to buy the 3rd weight to win the game (total sum payable =3+8 =13). Instead he could have bought the second weight and then he would have won the game with total sum payable = 3+1 =5.

Input The first line of input contains a single integer 'n', denoting the total number of inequalities. Each of the next 'n' lines contain 2 space separated integers ti and vi. ti denotes the type of inequality and vi denotes the value on the right hand side of the inequality.   Output Output two space separated integers, the first integer denoting the maximum number of inequalities which are satisfied for some value of 'x', and the second integer denoting the minimum value of 'x' for which the maximum number of inequalities are satisfied.   Example  Input: 4 1 10 2 9 3 7 4 4  Output: 3 7  Constraints: 1 <= n <= 100000 1 <= ti <= 4 1 <= vi <= 10^18   Explanation: The given inequalities are: 1) x > 10, 2) x < 9, 3) x = 7, 4) x != 4. For x=7, the inequalities 2), 3) and 4) are satisfied. 
Chakra is a young and dynamic entrepreneur, who is developing rapidly as a successful hotelier. He owns the Quickbyte chain of restaurants, 'M' of which are fully functional now. He divides each day into 'N' time slots. For each time slot 'j', in every restaurant 'i', there are Aij waiters and Bij customers. Being a quality conscious person, he wants each waiter to handle atmost one customer in a given time slot. Since he is really busy, in a day each restaurant is open only during one of the time slots. Since the hunger and demand for food varies during the day, the price which the customer is willing to pay varies, and is given by Cij for a restaurant 'i' during a time slot 'j'. Given the values of Aij, Bij and Cij, find the maximum profit which Chakra can make in a day.   Input The first line of input contains an integer 't', denoting the number of test cases.  For each testcase, the first line contains 2 space separated integers 'M' and 'N'.  Each of the next 'M' lines contains 'N' integers. The i^th integer on the j^th line denotes the value of Aij Each of the next 'M' lines contains 'N' integers. The i^th integer on the j^th line denotes the value of Bij Each of the next 'M' lines contains 'N' integers. The i^th integer on the j^th line denotes the value of Cij  Output For each test case output one value, denoting the maximum profit which Chakra can make in a day.   Example  Input: 1 2 3 1 2 3 3 2 1 3 2 1 1 2 3 4 5 2 3 1 6  Output: 16  Constraints: t ≤ 50 1 ≤ M,N ≤ 100 1 ≤ Aij, Bij ≤ 5000 0 ≤ Cij ≤ 10^9   Explanation: Test case 1: By opening the first restaurant at time slot 2 and second restaurant at time slot 3, Chakra makes a profit = 2*5 + 1*6 = 16. Note that although there are 3 customers for the second restaurant at time slot 3, since there is only 1 waiter, only 1 customer can be served. 
Nivash and Bhoopathi play a game of memory, which goes as follows: There is a tree containing 'N' nodes, all of which are initially uncoloured.  In the game, Nivash has 2 moves:  1) Command: Color a particular node with a given color.  2) Query: Ask Bhoopathi if the path from node 'a' to node 'b' (both inclusive), is monochromatic or not.(i.e Whether all nodes on the path have the same color).    Nivash can do these steps in any order he wishes and he colors each node atmost once. Whenever Nivash puts forth a 'Query' at Bhoopathi, Bhoopathi has to recollect the colouring of the tree and reply either "YES" or "NO". Can your help Bhoopathi answer these queries?    Input The first line of input contains an integer 'N', denoting the number of nodes in the tree.  The next 'N-1' lines contain 2 space separated integers 'u' and 'v', denoting an edge between vertex 'u' and vertex 'v'. The next line contains an integer 'Q', denoting the number of inputs (commands and queries) which Nivash wants to give. The next 'Q' lines contain 3 space separated integers 'x', 'a', 'b'. If 'x' is 1, it denotes a command to color node 'a' with a color 'b'. If 'x' is 2, it denotes a query and Bhoopathi should answer if the path from node 'a' to node 'b' (both inclusive), is monochromatic or not. All vertices of the tree are 0 based.   Output For each query, output "YES" or "NO" (quotes for clarity), denoting whether the path from node 'a' to node 'b' (both inclusive), is monochromatic or not.  Output "NO", even if all nodes on the path from node 'a' to node 'b' (both inclusive) are uncolored.   Example  Input: 3 0 1 1 2 7 1 0 11 2 0 1 2 0 2 1 2 12 1 1 11 2 0 1 2 0 2  Output: NO NO YES NO  Constraints: 1 ≤ N ≤ 100000 1 ≤ Q ≤ 200000 1 ≤ color value ≤ 30.   Explanation: Initially node '0' is colored with color '11', so path between node '0' and node '1' is not monochromatic. Hence, the answer is "NO". The same explanation holds for the path between node '0' and  node '2'. Then node '2' is colored with color '12' and node '1' with color '11'. Now, all nodes on the path between node '0' and node '1' are colored with only one color ('11'), so the answer is "YES". The path between node '0' and node '2' has 2 colors ('11' and '12'), hence the answer is "NO". 
What is the expected number of nodes in a trie when 'N' words, each of length 'L' are inserted into it. The words are made up only of 0's and 1's. The words may be repeated and all possible permutations of words are equally likely. Initially the trie consists of only one node (root node).   Input The first line of input contains an integer 't', denoting the number of test cases. Each of the next 't' lines contain 2 space separated integers 'N' and 'L'.   Output For each test case, output one floating point value denoting the expected number of nodes in the trie. Output the values rounded off to 2 decimal places. Always print 2 digits after the decimal point. To know more about tries visit here.   Example  Input: 2 1 3 2 2  Output: 4.00 4.25  Constraints: t ≤ 25 1 ≤ N ≤ 300 1 ≤ L ≤ 300   Explanation: Test case 1: There are 8 possible words of length 3. Which ever word is inserted into the trie, we get only 4 nodes. 
 Harsha is given 9 integers a1, a2, a3, .... a9. This denotes that he is given a1 1's, a2 2's,......a9 9's. Let 'x' = (a1  + a2 + ...a9). Now, Harsha makes all possible 'x' digit numbers by using these given digits. Let S be the set of all such numbers which he makes. Now he constructs a directed graph containing |S| nodes, in which each node denotes a unique number from the set. For all numbers u,v belonging to S, there is a directed edge from node 'u' to node 'v in the graph iff u>v. It is easy to note that we obtain a directed acyclic graph. Whats more, the edges of the graph are weighted. The weight of an edge joining node 'u' and node 'v' is equal to u+v. Now, Deepak decides to test Harsha's memory and gives him 'Q' queries. Each query consists of two numbers 'u', 'v' (u>v, both belonging to the set S). For each query Harsha must provide the following answers: 1) How many distinct paths are there from node 'u' to node 'v' in the graph. 2) For each distinct path 'i' from node 'u' to node 'v', let Si denote the sum of weights of all edges on this path. Calculate the value of sum(Si), for every distinct path 'i' from node 'u' to node 'v'.   Input  The first line of input contains 9 integers a1, a2, ....a9. The second line contains a single integer 'Q', denoting the number of queries. Each of the next 'Q' lines contain 2 numbers 'u' and 'v'.   Output  For each query, output 2 space separted integers denoting the number of distinct paths and sum of weights of all paths respectively. Since the output can be large, output these quantities modulo 1000000007.  Two paths (v1, v2, .... vm) and (u1, u2, .... un) are distinct if: 1) m != n 2) m = n, there exists some index 'k' (1 ≤ k ≤ m) such that vk != uk  Example  Input: 2 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 311 113  Output: 2 1110  Constraints: 1 ≤ (a1  + a2 + .... a9) ≤ 500 1 ≤ Q ≤ 20 ai ≥ 0   Explanation: Test case 1: The set S for the above problem is {311, 113, 131}. The edges of the graph are 311->131, 311->113, 131->113. There are 2 distinct paths from 311 to 113, namely (311->131->113) and (311->113). The sum of weights of edges on path-1 = (311+131)+(131+113) = 686. For path-2, the sum of weights of edges = (311+113) = 424. Therefore, answer  = 686 + 424 = 1110. 
Vikas is the chief interior designer incharge of the Taj Palace, Mumbai. He wants to make an impressive and colourful pattern in the courtyard. Importing exotic tiles has become very difficult after the Mumbai terror attacks, and therefore Vikas has only 4 kinds of tiles to choose from:  A      B      C       D ==    ==    ==    == XX    X     X      X XX    X     XX   Any rotation of above tiles is also permitted.  Each tile is available in 'k' different colors, and there's an infinite supply of all tiles. The courtyard has dimensions 2 * 'n'. Vikas wants to tile the courtyard in such a way that no two adjacent tiles have the same color. Two tiles are considered adjacent if they share a common side. Two tilings are considered different if: 1) The arrangement of tiles is different. 2) There is atleast 1 position (1*1 square) which has different colors in the two arrangements.  Can you help Vikas find the number of different ways in which he can tile the courtyard, subject to the above conditions?    Input  The first line of input contains a single integer 't', denoting the number of test cases. Each of the next 't' lines contains 2 space separated integers 'n' and 'k'.   Output For each test case output one integer, denoting the number of different ways in which the courtyard can be tiled. Two tiles are considered adjacent if they share an edge. Two tiles which just share a common point are not considered adjacent.    Example  Input: 2 1 1 1 2  Output: 1 4  Constraints: t ≤ 1000 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 1 ≤ k ≤ 1000   Explanation: Test case 1: There is only 1 way to tile the courtyard, by using a 2*1 tile. Test case 2: Let '1' and '2' be the available colors. The grid can be tiled in 4 ways - 1) place one 2*1 tile of color '1', 2) place one 2*1 tile of color '2', 3) Place two 1*1 tiles (color '1' above and color '2' below), 4) Place two 1*1 tiles (color '2' above and color '1' below) 
 Sumit specialises in sorting algorithms, and Abhishek decides to test Sumit's coding skills. An array of 'n' numbers a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1] is given. Abhishek gives a sequence of inputs of the form "v i j". Each input is either a query or an update (query if 'v' is 0, update otherwise).  For any input of the form "0 i j" ,Sumit's output should be as follows:  If the subarray a[i], a[i+1], ... a[j] is unsorted, output 0.  If the subarray a[i], a[i+1], ... a[j] is sorted in non-descending order, output 1.  If the subarray a[i], a[i+1], ... a[j] is sorted in non-ascending order, output 2.  If the subarray a[i], a[i+1], ... a[j] is sorted in both non-ascending and non-descending order (i.e, if all the elements in the  range are equal), output 3.  Any other input "v i j" (v!=0) should be treated as an update, as follows:  For each element in the subarray a[i], a[i+1], ... a[j], Sumit has to replace the element a[k] with v-a[k].  Sumit is really tired and does not want to write a program. Can you write a program for Sumit, which responds to Abhishek's instructions?     Input The first line of input contains 2 space separated integers 'n' and 'q'. The second line contains 'n' integers a[0], a[1], ....., a[n-1]. Each of the next 'q' lines contain 3 integers 'v', 'i', 'j'.   Output  For each query, output a single integer 0, 1, 2 or 3, denoting the answer.    Example  Input: 4 5 3 -2 -5 1 1 1 3 0 0 3 0 0 2 0 2 3 0 0 1  Output: 0 1 2 3  Constraints: 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000 1 ≤ q ≤ 100000 -5000 ≤ a[i] ≤ 5000 -5000 ≤ v ≤ 5000   Explanation Initial array is {3, -2, -5, 1}. After first update, the array will be {3, 3, 6, 0}. Now, from indices '0' to '3', it is unsorted. From indices '0' to '2', it is sorted in non-descending order. From indices '2' to '3', it is sorted in non-ascending order. Between indices '0' and '1', the values are equal. 
Its Chef's Birthday and his friends are demanding him for treat. So he went to the shop to buy N gift packets (one for each friend). Each gift packet bought from shop contains some number of chocolates in it.  Chef believes in equality i.e. all gift packets should contain equal number of chocolates in it. So Chef thought to rearrange the chocolates, one by one, such that all gift packets should contain equal number of chocolates afterwards.  But since its Chef's Birthday he wants to do this in minimum number of chocolates moved. Help Chef to do this task and you might also get treat from Chef :p  Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of gift packets. The second line contains N space-separated integers C1, C2, ..., CN denoting the number of chocolates in i^th gift packet.   Output  For each test case, output a single line containing number of minimum moves required such that each gift packet contain equal number of chocolates. If it is not possible to do so then print "No Treat".   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ Ci ≤ 10^6   Example Input: 2 4 5 2 4 5 6 5 2 4 1 7 5  Output: 2 5  Explanation Example case 1. Chef can move one chocolate from 1st gift packet to 2nd gift packet (distribution looks like 4 3 4 5). Now in next move he moves one chocolate from last gift packet to 2nd gift packet. Final distribution looks like 4 4 4 4 which took place in 2 moves. 
One day Alice visited Byteland to purchase jewels for her upcoming wedding anniversary. In Byteland, every Jewelry shop has their own discount methods to attract the customers. One discount method called Buy1-Get1 caught Alice's attention. That is, Alice buys one jewel, then she can get one additional jewel with the same color without charge by Buy1-Get1. Alice lists the needed jewels as a string S, each letter denotes one jewel, and the same letters denote the same colors of jewels, and the different letters denote the different colors of jewels. The cost of each jewel is 1. Your task is to calculate the minimum cost for getting all the jewels Alice listed.  Input The first line of input contains a single line T, which represents the number of test cases. Then T lines will follow, and each contains a string S, which represents the jewels Alice needed.  Output Output the minimum cost for each test case.  Constraints 1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ |S| ≤ 200, where |S| represents the length of the string S.  The string S is case sensitive, and will contain only English characters in the range [a-z], [A-Z].  Sample  Input: 4 ssss ssas sa s  Output: 2 3 2 1  Explanation In the first sample case, Alice needs 4 jewel of color s. One of the optimal way is the following: Buy the first s with cost 1, and she can get the second s without charge. Then buy the third s with cost 1, and she can get the last s without charge. In this case, she get 4 jewels with only cost 2. In the second sample case, Alice needs 3 jewels of color s and 1 jewel of color a. One of the optimal way is the following: Buy the second s with cost 1, and she can get the last s without charge. Then buy the a and the first s with cost 2. In this case, she get 4 jewels with only cost 3. In the third and fourth sample cases, she cannot save her money by using Buy1-Get1. 
  Walter white wants to buy a car, he does not care much about the type of car (sedan/hatchback/SUV) nor the power that the car has, all he cares about is how much the car will cost him, since he has loads of money , he wants to buy the most expensive car available in the market, but there is a catch! The tax percentages for each car vary and Walt wants to buy the most expensive car (including the tax costs), since there is a large selection of cars to choose from and he is busy 'cooking' for most of the time, he knocks on your door (because he is the one who knocks) one fine day and asks you to give him an efficient solution for his problem. If two cars have the same cost after adding the tax costs, Walt wants the car which has higher base price. Note: There is no case where the base price and interest rates of any two cars are the same   Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each line contains :N denoting the number of cars The next  N  lines contain  string S denoting the car name The cost of the car C The tax percentage to be paid for that particular car i   Output For each test case, output a single line containing the name of the car that you have to suggest for walter to buy  Constraints 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000 1 ≤ N ≤ 100 1 ≤ S ≤ 20 100 ≤ C ≤ 1000000 0 ≤ i ≤ 100    Example Input: 2 3 Ferrari $100000 20% Porsche $200000 10% Lamborghini $300000 10% 2 BMW $20000 50% Benz $15000 100%  Output: Lamborghini BMW    Explanation Example case 1. Lamborghini is the costliest car among the given cars Example case 2. The two cars turn out to be the same cost after taxes, but the base price of BMW is more 
Suraj, a software engineer from Mumbai just got placed in a software company in New Delhi. As, he has to relocate from Mumbai to Delhi, he decided to buy a house. Yeah price of houses have decreased after Narendra Modi became PM of India. He decided to buy a house in a locality which has burger points at each corner. As the streets are only one way there is a heavy traffic jam and it take time to Suraj to reach burger point. Modi just declared that he will convert some streets connecting these burger points to two way roads. Some conversion cost is associated with each street. It will cost lot of money to convert all streets to two way streets so Modi  wanted these conversion in such a way that total cost of conversion is minimized keeping in mind that all burger points are connected with two way roads. Suraj after coming to know about this idea decided to buy a house in a two way street. But not all streets will be two way. So, he ask you to tell him if he should buy house in a particular street or not. As there can be more than one conversion plan, help Suraj to decide if he should buy house in that street or not. You will be given m queries by Suraj. Your task is to tell for how many queries will the answer be yes. Return ans in the form of a/b where a is the no. of queries for which ans is yes and b is total number of queries. (gcd(a,b) should be 1).  There will be n burger points and k streets joining them.  Input First line of input contain 1 integer t denoting no.of test cases. Next line of input will contain 2 positive integers n and k where n is the no.of burger points and k is the no.of streets connecting them.  Burger points are numbered 1 to n. Next k line contain 3 positive integers x, y, cst, each denoting street between x and y and cst is the cost associated with that street. Next line contains 1 integer m denoting number of queries. Next m line contains 2 integers c,d.  Output Output answer in the form as specified in ques. For more clarity see sample test case.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 15 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000 1 ≤ cst ≤ 100 k = min(1001, (n*(n-1)/2)) - n) + n 1 ≤ q ≤ k   Example Input: 1 7 10 1 2 5 1 4 3 1 5 12 1 6 5 4 5 1 5 6 2 5 3 1 3 6 16 4 7 1 2 4 1 5 1 6 2 4 3 5 3 6 1 2  Output: 2/5  Explanation For the queries 2 and 3 there can be a two way road. Hence, total number of yes are 2 and total queries are 5 and hence the answer is 2/5.

 Note: For Turbo C++, select "Text" as your language Problem Description: Dr Watson loves to post the cases solved by Sherlock Holmes online. Every story that is put on his blog is mysterious and exciting. This time there is a twist, Sherlock Holmes has solved the mystery all on his own and refuses to tell Dr Watson who is the person that is guilty. Frustrated by this Watson posts all the clues and the events online. He expects someone intelligent enough to solve the case and let him know, how sherlock solved it. Although this information is not readily available and is in an encrypted form. He does so, so that all the people do not come to know that Watson is still puzzled, and out of the few who do he expects an answer…   The following was posted on his blog:   okius,uoeecjoenmwmro* nhtdhbpwnroonxhs.slu* eotdirajeerhatio'oot* slienenuibnnndsnwnct* nmnngadsgrecdad.hbkh* oegatklthorrpyohirhe* wsbshioibt.iahoecooi* ywynrnonohtmuorbhtln* naaoogktrehslltrohmc* isfwuieihreocmhofeei* giibgtdmosinreaktrsd* hnrah.oeorr,istehsqe* thelhhutdunmmgryesun* ,i.liotoknaasoeothet* ssacsltsiamrotauhos?* hhlawmhedreknadrrut** eolmieeesosc.n'weli** ruoenswtwuwrto?iedo** lsfcdgihhneihtcncsn** oearoonrodrmeerdrha** cssawtdewaesnoioieb**  The place where he used to write “The Game is On”, he wrote ”tas* hmo* een* gi**”.

Mike is a naughty child. He never takes his classes seriously. He usually plays mathematical games in his boring lectures. This time he started writing an infinite GP of positive numbers with a common ratio of 2.  1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128..... He named this series as M-series and made a game.

Gandalf’s secret mark on the door did its job. One by one, all the dwarves entered Bilbo’s house and Thorin and his band of dwarves took their places. Bilbo, for one, was as confused as one could be as to what was going on. There were so many dwarves in his house, singing songs about reclaiming the lonely mountain and helping themselves with all the food in his house. Anyone else would probably have lost their cool and asked the uninvited guests to leave but not Bilbo. He had always been a brilliant host and it was going to stay that way. He decided to help but he’d be smart about it. Bilbo figured that he’d have to clean up on his own afterwards, so he came up with a scheme that would allow him to use very few glasses. Since everyone could not fit at the table at once, they had supper in turns and the once a dwarf completed his supper and went out, his glass was available to be used by a new dwarf entering the room. Bilbo marked the time at which each person sat down to eat and got up. Now, assuming that there’s no time lag between a person getting up from the table another taking his place and assuming that the glass can also be used by the other person right away, what is the minimum number of glasses that Bilbo should set at the table so that everyone can have their supper. Let ‘n’ be the total number of uninvited dwarfs and let ‘s’ and ‘t’ be the starting and finishing time respectively for each one of them, then output the minimum number of glasses at the table that would do the job.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer t denoting the number of testcases. Every testcase consists of the following lines: The first line contains an integer n denoting the number of uninvited dwarfs. The next n lines contain two space separated integers denoting the starting time s and finishing time f respectively. NOTE: s will always be smaller than f  Output For every testcase output a single line containing an integer denoting the minimum number of glasses required.  Constraints 1 <= t <= 5 1 <= n <= 1000000 1 <= s, f <= 10^18  Example  Input: 1 7 1830 1925 1920 2000 1915 1950 1845 1930 1850 1855 1800 1900 1905 1945  Output: 5 
In a distant future, the world has reduced down to very few cities, all hostile to each other. So much so, that each city built its own roads to other cities, if needed and these roads were one way roads. No one dares to walk on someone else's and even though teleportation is possible, the dangers involved are too great for anyone to risk their lives. With time, however, certain cities became allies and certain blocks were formed. Within each block, trade was possible between any two cities by road but teleportation was used to reduce the travelling time to zero. Bilbo wants to reach a city 'D' (destination) and he's at city 'S' in the shortest time possible. However, Bilbo has a map that's a few years old and represents the travelling time between two cities before the blocks described above were formed. Your job is to find what the actual minimum possible time to travel from a city S to a city D for Bilbo.  Input The first line of input will consist of two integers n and q. n represents the number of cities in the old map and q is the number of queries. The next few lines of the input consist of 3 integers, i, j, k, which represents a one way road from city i to city j with travelling time of k. The roads information ends with an input of -1   -1   -1. The next q lines contain 2 integers s   d. s represents the source city and d represents the destination city.  Output For each query you have to output a single line containing an integer denoting the minimum time possible between the two cities. If no path is possible between the two cities, output “Unreachable” (quotes only for clarity).  Constraints 2 <= n <= 50 0 <= i, j < n 1 <= k <= 100000 1 <= q <= 100000 0 <= s, d < n  Example  Input: 6 5 0 1 2 1 2 10 0 3 9 4 5 2 4 1 15 2 4 20 3 4 8 -1 -1 -1 0 1 0 5 3 4 0 3 4 5 Output: 2 4 8 9 2 
Balin is stuck in a labyrinth beneath the lonely mountain and roof is about to collapse. Add a fire breathing dragon to the mix and it’s safe to say that he is desperate to get out of there as quickly as possible. Your task is to help him find the path to get out this pickle! The labyrinth is represented as a m-by-n matrix with Balin’s position marked as ‘s’ and the exit marked as ‘f’. Cells are marked either as ‘b’ or ‘w’. The ‘w’ marked cells represent traps in the labyrinth, designed to kill and so Balin cannot choose those cells in his path to get out. The only safe positions are the ones that are marked with b’s. Your program must output the matrix containing ‘b’ in each cell on the required path and ‘-‘ (ASCII Code 45) in the other cells. In case there is no way for Balin to survive, output “The path doesn’t exist.”. There is only one path to come out of the labyrinth but the labyrinth contains false paths which Balin must avoid because they will eventually lead to  a trap.  Input The first line of the input will consist of an integer t representing the number of testcases. Every testcase consists of the following lines: The first line contains two integers n and m representing the number of rows and columns respectively. Next n lines contain m letters denoting the map of the labyrinth.  Output For each testcase output an n X m matrix that has ‘s’, ‘f’ at the same positions as in the input matrix and a path represented by b’s which is path from s to f and for all other positions output a ‘–‘. If no such path exists, output "The path doesn't exist." (quotes only for clarity). NOTE: Balin cannot move diagonally  Constraints 1 <= T <=10 2 <=n,  m<=1000  Example  Input: 2 6 5 bbbbw bwwfw bbbww bwwww bbbbw wwwbs  4 4 bbbw wwfw bwww bbbs   Output: bbbb- b--f- b---- b---- bbbb- ---bs The path doesn't exist. 
Two strings can be shuffled by interspersing their letters to form a new string, much like two piles of cards can be shuffled to form a single pile. For example, the strings HELLO and WORLD can be shuffled to form HWEOLRLLOD, or HEWORLLLDO, or perhaps simply HELLOWORLD. It is not a shuffle if the original order of letters is not preserved. For example, the D in WORLD cannot ever appear before the R after being shuffled. This means that EHLLOWRDLO, for instance, is not a shuffle of HELLO and WORLD, even though it contains all the original letters. A string is a shuffle of twins if it can be formed by shuffling two identical strings. For example, ABACBDECDE is a shuffle of twins because it can be formed by shuffling ABCDE and ABCDE. DBEACBCADE is not a shuffle of twins because it cannot be formed by shuffling two identical strings. All the strings will contains only UPPERCASE letters. In case, no twins exist output “Twins don’t exist” (quotes only for clarity). All strings will contain only UPPERCASE letters.  Input The first line of the input will is integer T denoting the number of testcases. Next T lines contain the shuffled string S. The input string can contain upto N letters.  Output For every testcase, output a single line containing one of the two identical strings that make up the input string. If the no such pair of identical strings exist, print "Twins don't exist". (quotes only for clarity).  Constraints 1 <= T <= 10 2 <= N <= 10^6  Example  Input: 2 ABACBDECDE DBEACBCADE  Output: ABCDE Twins don't exist 
Do you like Treasure Hunts? I like treasure hunts. Love ‘em. And TROIKA 2013 has the best one ever in ‘MIST’ (apps.facebook.com/mist_troika). Just like a normal treasure hunt, you are given several clues and you have to get the right answer to progress to the next level and so on, until you reach the ultimate prize! But the organizers have learnt that a lot of users are not progressing even after figuring out the correct answer; it seems ‘someone’ forgot to code in ‘possible variants of the correct answer’ for each level. For example, if “Sachin Tendulkar” happened to be the answer to a particular level, “Tendulkar” or “tendulkar” or “sachin tendulkar” wasn’t accepted as correct. This is what you have to rectify. Given the expected answer ‘S’, your job is to modify the answer-verification-system to be able to allow acceptable variants of ‘S’. If the user enters an acceptable variant ,terminate the program. You can assume that the user is intelligent enough so that he will enter the answer in an order specified by the string S i.e he will not enter anything like “Tendulkar Sachin” if the answer is “Sachin Tendulkar” however he can enter “Tendulkar”.  Input The first line of the input contains a string S. The next few lines contain the input string P entered by the user.  Output For every line entered by the user output “Yes” if the string is acceptable and “No” if it is not. (quotes only for clarity).  Contraints 1 <= length of S and P <= 10000  Example  Input 1: Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar Sach Ram sAcH Tendul sach Tendulkar Sachin Ram Tendulkar SAChin TENduLkaR  Output 1: No No No No No Yes  Input 2: Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar Sach Ram sAcH Tendul sach Tendulkar Sachin Ram Tendulkar Ramesh TENduLkaR  Output 2: No No No No No Yes 
We the students belonging to IIST, have found an electronic device for space applications. In order to standardize, for measuring the component value we decided to opt the resistance color coding algorithm. The electronic component contains four bands of colors. Now the electronic department needs your help for measuring the component value if the four color bands are given.Since it was invented by a student GUNTUR, the component value follows the unit name 'Guntur' with a space between them. NOTE: Excluding tolerance color bands like gold and silver  Input Input contains four strings of colors of resistance color coding with spaces between them.

 The Chef is having a dinner party and invited over all his friends.  His guests being fairly health conscious have exact protein requirements, and The Chef wishes to oblige them all.   The Chef will cook dishes for each individual guest using the ingredients in his kitchen.  Each ingredient has a specific amount of protein. The complete dish will have a protein content value equal to the sum of the protein contents of the individual ingredients. To cook a dish, The Chef can use any of the ingredients which appear on his shelf, but only in the order which they appear on the shelf.  The same ingredient may appear multiple times, and can also be used as many times as it appears.   There are multiple ways to choose ingredients following the rules given above. However, The Chef is only interested in choosing the set of ingredients that appear first in a lexicographically ordered list of ingredients which satisfy the protein constraints.  Your job is to write a program that helps The Chef figure out which dish to serve!   Input The first line of input contains t, the number of guests invited by The Chef (about 200).   Each test consists of three lines:  The first line consists of one integer 1 ≤ k ≤ 26 (the number of  unique  ingredients on the shelf) and than k space-separated positive integers from the set {1, 2, ... ,15} describing the protein content for each ingredient in an alphabetically sorted list of unique ingredients.  (the first protein value corresponds with ingredient a, the second corresponds with the protein value for ingredient b, and so on). The second line contains L - a sequence of lower-case letters of the Latin alphabet (at most 1000) which signify the name of the ingredient. The third line contains one positive integer S which specifies the exact protein requirement of this guest (1 < S < 500).   Output For each testcase either output the sequence of ingredients as described above, or the word 'IMPOSSIBLE' if no such subsequence exists.   Example  Input: 3 5 12 1 12 4 4 acccdadceb 2 3 5 4 6 abcbacbabcc 15 2 3 4 baba 7  Output: IMPOSSIBLE aaa ab   Comments: For the first guest we have five ingredients: a, b, c, d, e with protein values 12 1 12 4 4 respectively. To achieve a total protein value equal to 2 we need two ingredients b. But there is only one, thus the answer is IMPOSSIBLE. For the second guest we can achieve a total protein value of 15 with the ingredients taken as: abc, bca, acb, cab, cba, bac, or aaa. Of these, the first according to lexicographic order is aaa.  For the third guest, out of the two possibilities, ab is the correct answer. 
  The Chef was an exceptionally great student, but did not write any of his exams well, and used to fail a lot receiving zeros in a lot of problems. This caused the Chef to have a fascination towards zeros.  The Chef wanted to write a program to help him find the number to trailing zeros. Let there be a whole number N such that N! (N factorial) when written in base 10 (decimal notation) ends in P Zeroes. The chef wants to find the smallest N which produces P Trailing Zeroes.  Note: It is assured that N exists for values of P tested.  Input The first line consists of T number of test cases. Then T lines follow each taking the input P.    Output >Your program has to print the number N for each test case in T lines.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 0 ≤ P ≤ 10^9     Example Input: 1 2  Output: 10    Explanation Test case 1. 10!= 3628800 (Two trailing zeroes). 
  Chef is long overdue for his laundry and is trying to figure out how to use a washing machine. He asks his friend Raseac to help him. Raseac loves riddles though. He accepts to help the chef out but asks him to solve or decode his riddle before he assists in the operation of the washing machine. He said:  I came, I saw, I conquered methinks is 'gagtgbgtglct'. [venividivici==gagtgbgtglct] So tell me my dear Chef, what you think about my other riddles?  Input The first line consists of T number of test cases. Then T lines follow, each taking string of characters as an input (not more than 1000 characters). Do not consider any spaces between the characters.  Output The decoded string has to be shown as the output for all the T test cases. Tips: Raseac, a funny name, dont you think?    Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10     Example Input: 1 gagtgbgtglct  Output: venivedivici   
Smugglers are becoming very smart day by day. They use SMS to communicate with each other. Police can often intercept their messages and bust them. Now they have developed a new technique of sending their messages from one smuggler to another. In their new technology, they are sending their messages in a number format. This format represents the way that numbers and characters are padded on mobile’s keypad. One smuggler sends a text message to the second smuggler, using the numbers corresponding to the letters on the keypad. When the receiving smuggler gets the message, he simply opens the “create text message” function in his mobile and types the number string. This way the receiver finally reads the original message.   1 2ABC 3DEF   4GHI 5JKL 6MNO   7PQRS 8TUV 9WXYZ   * 0[SPACE] #    For Example: 6999066263304447777077766622337778 -----> message sent by the first smuggler. my name is robert---------> message decoded by the second smuggler. Where ‘0’ denotes the "space". But for word monkey 6#666#665533999 this string will be sent by the smuggler one Here ‘# ‘ denotes that if smuggler watches ‘#’ then it means character previous to # is on the same key to the character after the ‘#’ and smuggler has to wait for 2 seconds and then press the same key.  You have to make a program  that takes as input a numerically coded string as message and outputs decoded message.  Constraints  Smuggler can never send numbers in message text Output will always be in uppercase  Input First line T, will have a single integer having number of test cases followed by T lines of input each having CODED message send by smuggler 1.  Output For each test case, output a single line containing the message smuggler 2 will get after decoding.  Example  Input: 2 6999066263304447777077766622337778 6#666#665533999  Output: MY NAME IS ROBERT MONKEY  Explanation: By pressing ‘6’ (i.e. key’6’ one time) on the keypad, the mobile shows ‘m’ on display screen in write text message area. By pressing ‘999’ (i.e. key ‘9’ three times) on the keypad, the mobile shows ‘y’ on display screen in write text message area. By pressing ‘0’ (i.e. key ’0’ one time) on the keypad, the mobile shows ‘space’ on display screen in write text message area.

Output Print a single integer which is answer to the corresponding input.  Constraints 2<=N<=1000 1<=M<=100000 1<=A, B<=N  Example Input: 3 3 100 1 2 2 3 3 1 Output: 300  Input 4 2 50 1 2 2 3 Output 50    Explanation  In example 1, Student 1 will only accept gift if college gives gift to student 2 and for this it has to give gift to student 3 and student 3 will only accept gift if college gives gift to student 1. So college has to give gifts to all three students and cost of one gift is 100 rupees. So total cost is 300 rupees. 
Your friend Сhef has prepared a rectangular cake for you. Both of you want to divide the cake among yourselves. Your friend is generous enough to let you choose your share first. You have decided to take two pieces.For the first piece you make a rectangular cut (each side of this cut is parallel to the corresponding side of the cake) inside the cake. Now the cake have two pieces. You take the piece inside the rectangle cut. For the second piece, you make another rectangular cut (each side of this cut is parallel to the corresponding side of the cake) inside the cake. Now the cake again have two pieces. You take the piece inside the rectangle cut (note that this piece may not be rectangular, because of cut may cross an empty space that remains from the first piece, also it can be empty). Your friend will have the rest of the cake.Given the cuts determine the amount of cake that you will have. The amount is calculated as the sum of the areas covered by your pieces. The cake can be considered as a rectangle with the lower left corner at (0,0) and the upper right corner at (1001,1001).

The chef is preparing a birthday cake for one of his guests, and his decided to write the age of the guest in candles on the cake. There are 10 types of candles, one for each of the digits '0' through '9'. The chef has forgotten the age of the guest, however, so doesn't know whether he has enough candles of the right types. For example, if the guest were 101 years old, the chef would need two '1' candles and one '0' candle. Given the candles the chef has, your task is to determine the smallest positive integer that cannot be represented with those candles.  Input: Input will begin with an integer T≤100, the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a single line with exactly 10 integers, each between 0 and 8, inclusive. The first integer of each test case represents the number of '0' candles the chef has, the second integer represents the number of '1' candles the chef has, and so on.  Output: For each test case, output on a single line the smallest positive integer that cannot be expressed with the given candles.

It’s Halloween. Papa Smurf has received a lot of orders of candies. One day, while packing candies, he counted number of different ways he can pack candies in a box. Two ways are different if there exists a candy type for which its count in resulting boxes is different. Box has a property that they can contain only a fixed number of candies, neither less nor more. If Papa has three types for candies S1, S2, S3 and three boxes (B1, B2, B3), and he has to pack 6 candies in each box. Suppose he pack candies in a way that box has configuration B1{S1 = 1, S2 = 0, S3 = 5},  B2(S1 = 1, S2 S3 = 2) and B3(S1 = 1, S2 = 0, S3 = 5), then Box B1 and B2 are said to have different configuration, while Box B1 and B3 are same. But wait, there are some candies of which Smurfs are very fond of. So they gave you a list of such candies and the minimum number for each candy they want in their box. If a candy is not in this list, then Papa can pack any number (including zero) of this type of candy. Now help Papa in counting different number of ways he can pack candies in a box. Papa has infinite supply of each type of candies.  Input First line of input contain three integers, N M K, number of candies to be packed in a box, number of types of candies Papa had and length of candy's list which Smurfs give to him respectively. Then follow K lines. In each lines there are two integers, Si Xi, type of candy and minimum number of candy he has to put in each box (1 ≤ i ≤ M).  Output Find number of different ways Papa can pack candies in a box. As this number can be very large print answer modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7).  Constraints 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000000 1 ≤ M ≤ 1000000 0 ≤ K ≤ M 1 ≤ Si ≤ M 1 ≤ Xi ≤ 1000000  Example  Input #0: 4 2 1 1 2  Output #0: 3  Input #1: 5 3 2 1 2 2 1  Output #1: 6  Input #2: 5 1 1 3 6  Output #2: 0   Explanation Explanation for Sample Input #0: Papa has to pack 4 candies in a box, and he has two types of candies (S1, S2). This particular Smurf has mentioned that the box must have at least 2 candy of candy type #1. Then there are 3 number of ways of packing candies, represented by (S1 = 2, S2 = 2), (S1 = 3, S2 = 1), (S1 = 4, S2 = 0). Explanation for Sample Input #2: Papa has to pack 5 candies in a box, while according to list he has to pack at least 6 candies of candy type 3. And it is not possible. 
In primary classes, we were taught how to add multi-digit numbers from right-to-left one digit at a time. Many of us found the carry operation - in which a 1 is carried from one digit position to be added to the next - to be a significant challenge at that point of time. (You may find it challenging yet again if you can't solve this D:) Your task is to count the number of carry operations required for adding two multi digit numbers.  Please take care of constraints, they may be extremely large  Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The next T lines contain 2 space-separated integers denoting the first and the second number for addition operation.     Output  For each test case, output the number of carry operations required for the addition operation.     Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 1000 1 ≤ a,b ≤ 10^15     Example Input: 3 123 456 555 555 123 594  Output: 0 3 1 
You have a set of unique numbers. You are trying to find a subset of this set such that no two numbers in the subset have a common digit. There will of course be several such subsets. You are interested in the subset with the maximum sum. The sum of a subset is defined as the sum of the numbers in the subset. In fact, you are most interested in the cardinality - that is, the number of elements - of the subset with the maximum sum. Of course there may be several such subsets with the same maximum sum. Find the cardinality of the subset with the most elements among such sets. Refer to the explanation section for more clarity.  Input There will be several test cases. Each test case is described in two lines. The first line contains the number N, the number of numbers in the set given to you. The second line contains N space separated positive integers, A1, A2 ..., AN. The input is terminated by EOF.  Output For each test case, output a single line. The line should contain a single integer which denotes the cardinality of the set that satisfies all the requirements in the problem statement.  Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 100 1 ≤ Ai ≤ 1000000000 No two Ai's will be same. There will be at most 100 test cases.   Sample Input  3 7 17 10 2 12 29 3 1 2 12   Sample Output  2 1 1   Explanation In the first test case, the maximum sum possible is 17. There are two ways to achieve that sum. {7, 10}, with a cardinality of 2. {17}, with a cardinality of 1. Hence, the answer is 2, since it is more. In the second test case, we can select only 1 number due to the constraint that the numbers in the subset should not share any digits. The answer is of course 1, for the subset {29}. Note that a subset of cardinality 2 is possible, {1, 2}. But, its sum is only 3. The sum of the subset {12} is 12, which is the maximum possible. Hence the answer is the cardinality of the set {12}, which is 1. 
Problem Statement Today we are going to play a very interesting game. In the game N balls will be thrown at you horizontally from one side of the arena one after the other. Each ball will be thrown at a specified height above the ground and since the arena is gravity free, the balls will reach you at the same height that they were thrown. You will be given a bucket to catch these incoming balls from across the game arena. The bucket will be initially placed on the ground (Height=0). In order to catch a ball you must bring your bucket to the height at which the ball is coming. However, the bucket has a special property. Once it has been raised to a particular height, it can either stay at the same height or move higher in order to catch subsequent balls, but not move lower. Now assuming that you play optimally, we want you to find the maximum number of balls that you can catch in a given game. Input Specification  The first line of input contains an integer T, the number of games to be played. Then T test cases follow each containing 2 lines. The first line contains an integer N which is the number of balls that will be thrown in each game. The next line contains an array  of n integers specifying the predefined height at which the balls will be thrown. Thus the 1st value is the height at which the 1s ball will be thrown, the 2nd value is the height of the second ball and so on.   Constraints  1<=T<=100 1<=N<=1000 0<=Height at which each ball is thrown <=1000000   Output Specification  A single line for each game containing the maximum number of balls that you can catch in that game provided you play optimally.   Sample Input   2 6 1 8 5 6 7 9 6 7 5 3 1 9 5   Sample Output   5 2

 ACM International Collegiate     Programming Contest, Asia-Amritapuri Site, 2012 Saruman of Many Colours  '"For I am Saruman the Wise, Saruman Ring-maker, Saruman of Many Colours!"     'I looked then and saw that his robes, which had seemed white, were not so, but were woven of all colours.     And if he moved they shimmered and changed hue so that the eye was bewildered.' - Gandalf the Grey.  And so it was that Saruman decided to brand his Uruk-hai army with the many colours that he fancied. His method of branding his army was as follows. He straps his army of N Uruk-hai onto chairs on a conveyor belt. This conveyor belt passes through his colouring-room, and can be moved forward or backward. The Uruk-hai are numbered 0 to N-1 according to the order in which they are seated. Saruman wishes that the i'th Uruk-hai be coloured with the colour c[i]. Further, his colouring-room has space for exactly K chairs. Once the chosen K consecutive Uruk-hai are put into the room, a colour jet sprays all K of them with any fixed colour. The conveyor belt is not circular (which means that the N-1'th and the 0'th Uruk-hai are not consecutive). Note that Uruk-hai can be recoloured in this process.  Saruman wants to find out what is the minimum number of times that the jet needs to be used in order to colour his army in the required fashion. If it is not possible to colour the army in the required fashion, output -1.  Input (STDIN):  The first line contains the number of test-cases T. Each test case consists of 2 lines. The first line contains two space-separated integers, N and K. This is followed by a single line containing a string c of length N, describing the colours of the army. The i'th character of c denotes the colour of the i'th Uruk-hai in the army.  Output (STDOUT):  Output T lines, one for each test case containing the answer for the corresponding test case. Remember if it is not possible to colour the army as required, output -1.  Constraints:  1 <= T <= 50 1 <= K <= N <= 20,000 The string c has length exactly N and contains only the characters 'a',...,'z'.  Sample Input:   2 3 2 rgg 3 3 rgg  Sample Output:   2 -1  Notes/Explanation of Sample Input:  In the first test case, soldiers 0 and 1 can first be painted with 'r', and then soldiers 1 and 2 can be painted with 'g'. In the second test case, since N = K, all the soldiers will only have the same color.

Adam, an Adasaurus, works for a dish washing company. He comes across a pile consisting of N plates with a number tag each placed one on top of the other. He wishes to arrange the plates in the increasing order of the tag number. Though a plate can be pulled out of the stand, but it can only be returned to the top of the pile. Therefore, he can only sort the plates by repeatedly pulling out a plate and placing it on the top of the pile. The plates are labelled with numbers from 1 to N. So, they need to be ordered as (1, 2, ..., N), counting from the top. For example, if N = 3 and the starting order is (1, 3, 2), two moves are sufficient. First, pulling out the plate number 2 and placing it on top makes the order (2, 1, 3) and similarly with plate number 1 makes the final order (1, 2, 3). You need to help Adam sort the given starting order in minimum number of moves.  Input The first input line contains the integer N (N ≤ 300 000) and the subsequent N lines contain a single positive integer representing the order of Adam's plates from top to bottom of the pile. Also note that these integers 1, 2, 3,..., N appear exactly once.   Output Print the minimum number of moves required on a single line.   Example  Input: 3 1 3 2  Output: 2

In DDU's annual techno-cultural fest – Felicific, the Computer Engineering department is introducing a weird contest this time. In the contest, there are N registered participants, with heights h[1..N]. A coordinator speaks out a number K to all of them. The prize is awarded to any pair of participants whose heights add up to exactly K. The participants may form pairs however they like. Now, since you are to conduct this event and every event works with limited budgets, you need to find out whether, given the heights h[1..N] and the number K, is it possible for a pair to win? Assume that if there is such a pair, they will eventually find each other and claim the prize.  Note that exactly 2 participants are needed to claim the prize. A participant cannot choose himself as a partner, nor can more than 2 participants claim the prize if their heights add up to K  Input The first line contains 2 integers N and K denoting the number of registered participants and the required sum respectively. In the next line, there are exactly N integers denoting the heights of each participant.  Output Print "Yes" if such a pair exists, otherwise print "No" (without quotes).  Constraints  2 ≤ N ≤ 1000 0 ≤ K ≤ 2 * 10^18 0 ≤ h[i] ≤ 10^18   Example  Input 6 6 2 9 5 2 2 1  Output Yes   Explanation The pair (5, 1) can claim the prize.  
A robot is designed to move on a rectangular grid of M rows and N columns. The robot is initially positioned at (1, 1), i.e., the top-left cell. The robot has to reach the (M, N) grid cell. In a single step, robot can move only to the cells to its immediate east and south directions. That means if the robot is currently at (i, j), it can move to either (i + 1, j) or (i, j + 1) cell, provided the robot does not leave the grid. Now somebody has placed several obstacles in random positions on the grid, through which the robot cannot pass. Given the positions of the blocked cells, your task is to count the number of paths that the robot can take to move from (1, 1) to (M, N). Since the answer can get very large, output the answer modulo 1000000007.  Input The first line contains 3 integers M, N and P denoting the number of rows, number of columns and number of blocked cells respectively. In the next P lines, each line has exactly 2 integers i and j denoting that the cell (i, j) is blocked.  Output Output should contain a single integer, the number of paths modulo 1000000007.  Constraints  1 <= M, N <= 10^3 0 <= P <= M * N 1 <= i <= M 1 <= j <= N   Example  Input 4 3 2 3 3 3 1  Output 2   Explanation The only 2 possible paths are (1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (2, 2) -> (3, 2) -> (4, 2) -> (4, 3) and (1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 2) -> (3, 2) -> (4, 2) -> (4, 3)  
Somewhere out there, there are N islands numbered from 1 to N with no network connectivity. Communication is such a pain for the islands' dwellers. So the Kings of the islands go to nearby islands and decide to connect the islands with underwater cables for bidirectional communication. Initially no islands are connected with cables. You are required to process Q queries of the form:  t x y  where t denotes the type of query and can be 0 or 1. If t is 0, it denotes that a new cable is installed between islands x and y. When t is 1, you need to answer whether communication is possible between islands x and y. Two islands can communicate if a route can be established with the cables, i.e., the islands are directly or indirectly connected with cables.  Input The first line contains 2 integers N and Q denoting the number of islands and number of queries respectively. In the next Q lines, each line has a query of the form "t x y".  Output For each query of type 1, on separate lines print "Yes" if communication is possible or "No" otherwise (without quotes).  Constraints  2 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ Q ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ x, y ≤ N For each test case, x ≠ y   Example  Input 5 7 0 1 2 1 2 1 0 3 4 1 1 4 0 3 2 1 2 3 1 1 4  Output Yes No Yes Yes   Explanation Initially no islands are connected.  Join 1-2. Since 1 and 2 are connected, communication is possible. Join 3-4. Currently, 1-2 and 3-4 are the only cables. So no path from 1-4 is available. Join 2-3. So the connected islands are 1-2-3-4. Communication is possible between 2 and 3. Communication is possible between 1 and 4, due to the cables 1-2-3-4.  
Brachiosaurus is trying to become a detective by writing words in codes. It manipulates each word in a sentence by putting the letter 'z' after each vowel, followed by that very vowel. Eg- "belina" translates into "bezelizinaza" and "zazhiba" translates into "zazazhizibaza". A team of secret agents want to decode the sentences of Brachiosaurus.

 Today its going to be the Big Byteland FundRaiser Event. Many people who are to raise funds for their cause will be coming to this event. Carol has been having some financial issues with her NGO. Today she’ll have to convince some of the donors to donate for her NGO. As she has good links with the organisers, she managed to gather a description of the fixed donors disposition on the room (which is represented as an N × N square matrix), such that she knows in advance the amount each person will donate. She also knows that the room is divided into several parallel corridors, such that we will denote the j-th cell on corridor i, as [i][j].  Note that some donors can donate Carol, zero money or negative money(taking back what they consented to give already), as they may change their minds. There is just one donor at each cell of the matrix, except the cells [1][1] and [N][N]. To complete her fundraising, she must start on the top leftmost corner of the room (cell [1][1]), and finish on the bottom right corner (cell [N][N]), moving either to the cell directly in front of her on the same corridor (that is, moving from cell [r][c] to cell [r][c+1], where c+1 <= N) or to the cell in the next corridor directly in front of where she is (that is, moving from cell [r][c] to cell [r+1][c], where r+1 <= N). She will keep doing this until she reaches the end point of the room, i.e. last cell [N][N] on the last corridor. Carol will convince all visited cells with a donor. Carol wants to maximize her average donation at end. More specifically, if she passes K donors, each being on cell [i1][j1],  cell [i2][j2], ..., cell [iK][jK] respectively, then she wants to maximize (S[i1][j1] + S[i2][j2] + ... + S[iK][jK]) / K, where S[i][j] denotes the amount that the donor will give her on the cell [i][j]. Help her determine the best path she has to follow in order to maximize the average donations.   Input   The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.   The  first  line  contains  a  single  integer N denoting the number of size of matrix.  Each  of  the  next  N  lines  contains  N  space-separated  integers.   Note : The j-th integer S[i][j] in i-th line denotes the donation donated by the donor at cell [i][j]. Note that the cells [1][1] and [N][N] have no donors, so S[1][1] and S[N][N] will be 0.     Output For each test case, if the maximum possible average funds  Carol can obtain is negative, output a single line containing "No funds" (quotes for clarity). Otherwise, output the maximum possible average funds. The answer will be considered correct if it has an absolute error no more than 10^-6.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤  50 2 ≤ N ≤  100 -1000 ≤ S[i][j] ≤  1000 S[1][1] = S[N][N] =  0     Example Input: 2 2 0 -4 3 0 2 0 -4 -3  0  Output: 3.000000 No funds   
 Bob has given Scoop and Muck their new task. As of now, they are at House number X and Y. They have to fix some houses hi (X<=hi<=Y) in a straight lane. Things can be strange in their world. Only those houses have a problem and need to be fixed whose number is a N-Prime-divisors. A number is N-Prime-divisors if it has exactly N distinct prime divisors. For example number 4 is 1-Prime-divisors-number, number 42 is 3-Prime-divisors-number. So Scoop and Muck start from their places and move towards each other fixing all houses that are N-Prime-divisors. By time they meet, how many houses they have fixed in total(inclusive of the house where they meet)? Note :  A prime number is 1-Prime-Divisor because it is divisible by itself.   Input   The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.   Each test case contains three numbers X,Y and N separated by a space.      Output For each testcase, output on a separate line the number of N-Prime-divisors between X & Y.

  According to Wikipedia, an arithmetic progression (AP) is a sequence of numbers such that the difference of any two successive members of the sequence is a constant. For instance, the sequence 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, . . . is an arithmetic progression with common difference 2. For this problem, we will limit ourselves to arithmetic progression whose common difference is a non-zero integer. On the other hand, a geometric progression (GP) is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed non-zero number called the common ratio. For example, the sequence 2, 6, 18, 54, . . . is a geometric progression with common ratio 3. For this problem, we will limit ourselves to geometric progression whose common ratio is a non-zero integer. Given three successive members of a sequence, you need to determine the type of the progression and the next successive member.    Input Input description.  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows: The first line of each test case contains  three integers (−10, 000 < a1 , a2 , a3 < 10, 000) where a1 , a2 , and a3 are distinct.     Output   For each test case, you program must print a single line of the form:  XX v where XX is either AP or GP depending if the given progression is an Arithmetic or Geometric Progression. v is the next member of the given sequence. All input cases are guaranteed to be either an arithmetic or geometric progressions.      Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100     Example Input: 4 7 10 2 6 18  Output: AP 13 GP 54    Explanation Example case 1. It's an AP with difference 3 so next term is 13

  		Donald duck loves learning new algorithms. Today, he learned binary search and understood how it works on integer arrays sorted in non-decreasing order. His knack of getting into problems is famous, and he wrote his version of binary search algorithm as follows:  		binarySearch(int[] array, int lo, int hi, int key) 		{ 		    while (lo ≤ hi) 		    { 		        mid := random(lo, hi); 		        if a[mid] = key then 		            return mid; 		        else if (a[mid] > key) 		            hi := mid - 1; 		        else 		            lo := mid + 1; 		    } 		    return NOT_FOUND; 		}  		Yes! Donald did use random(lo, hi), instead of floor((lo+hi)/2) to calculate mid. The random(x, y) function returns a random integer between x and y, both inclusive. The problem did not stop here. Instead of giving arrays that are sorted in non-decreasing order as input, Donald was giving all sorts of integer arrays as input. 		Sure enough, the answers he got were far from expected. But he also noticed some interesting properties: searching for some numbers (which are already present in the array) in some arrays will always result in a successful search, but searching for some other numbers (which are also present in the array) in the same array need not always be successful. 		Formally, a number in an array (not necessarily sorted) is findable in the array, iff the number is guaranteed to be found in the array, using Donald's binary search, irrespective of whatever value the random function returns, whenever it is called. Given an integer array (not necessarily sorted) as input, Donald now wants to know the count of numbers that are findable in the array.   Input  		First line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases.  		Then 2T lines follow, two lines per test case.  		The first line of each test case contains a single integer N, the size of the array given as input to the function.  		The next line contains N unique space separated integers A[i], 0 ≤ i ≤ N-1   Output  		For each test case, print one integer (each on a new line) - the count of findable numbers in the array.   Constraints  		1 ≤ T ≤ 10  		1 ≤ N ≤ 10,000  		-1,000,000 ≤ A[i] ≤ 1,000,000   Example Input: 2 10 -40 -61 -50 -25 14 45 28 71 65 72 5 20 46 48 57 90  Output: 3 5  Explanation  Test Case 1: Here, only -25, 14 and 72 are findable in the array.  Test Case 2: Here, all 5 numbers are findable in the array.   
 		As part of his new invention, the gold cloning machine, Gyro Gearloose has to calculate nCr for large values of n (take a guess, why!!). But he has not added this part to the machine, as he has not yet been able to compute them efficiently. Now, Scrooge McDuck wants this machine completed by tomorrow. As Gyro is busy working on the aesthetics of the machine, he wants you to write and test the code for him.  		(nCr is the number of different ways of choosing r items from a group of n items.)   Input  		First line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases.  		Then T lines follow, one per test case.  		Each line contains two integers n and r.   Output  		For each test case, output a single line containing the value of nCr. Since the result can be too big, output the result modulo the prime number 1000000009 (10^9 + 9).   Constraints  		1 ≤ T ≤ 100  		0 ≤ n ≤ 200,000  		0 ≤ r ≤ n   Example Input: 3 10 5 100 50 0 0  Output: 252 933591892 1  Explanation  Test Case 1: The value of 10C5 is 252.  Test Case 2: The value of 100C50 is 100891344545564193334812497256. The result is larger than 1000000009. So, when reduced modulo 1000000009, it becomes 933591892.  Test Case 3: The value of 0C0 is 1.  
 		Mrs. Beakley was teaching her grand-daughter Webby some math. Today, Mrs. Beakley taught how to evaluate (possibly very large) expressions involving numbers and binary operators. Mrs. Beakley also gave Webby some homework. But Huey, Dewey and Louie wants Webby to join them for a game of Baseball. Help Webby complete her homework. 		Webby, being a brilliant duck, can handle expressions of any size. But Webby understood nothing in today's class, thanks to the teaching abilities of Mrs. Beakley. As of now, Webby can solve any expression, if it is well-formed. A well-formed expression is an expression in which, each binary operator, together with its operands (possibly other expressions) are enclosed in a pair of parenthesis. The number of pairs of parenthesis must match exactly the number of binary operators (not one more, not one less). 		Your task is to transform a given expression into a well-formed expression.   Input  		The only line of the input consists of a valid mathematical expression. This expression consists of at least one binary operator (+, *, -, /, ^) and the corresponding operands (each one being a single digit), and possibly a few properly matched pairs of parentheses. There are no white-spaces.   Output  		Output on a single line, the corresponding well-formed expression. There should be no white-spaces anywhere in the output expression.  		The default operator precedence is as follows: ^ has highest precedence. Then comes / and *, which have the same precedence. + and - have the same (least) precedence. Whenever there are two operators of the same precedence, the one that appears first in the expression (from left) will be evaluated first.   Constraints  		The expression given in the input will contain a maximum of 64 characters.   Example  Sample # 1 Input: 1+2  Output: (1+2)   Sample # 2 Input: 3-2-1  Output: ((3-2)-1)   Sample # 3 Input: 3-(2-1)  Output: (3-(2-1))   Sample # 4 Input: 1+2*(3-4)/5+1/2  Output: ((1+((2*(3-4))/5))+(1/2))   Sample # 5 Input: 1+2*(3-4)/5^1/2  Output: (1+(((2*(3-4))/(5^1))/2))

   Suppose a few students are giving an exam in the examination hall.The supervisor is bored of keeping a watch on the students so as they don't copy. However being a programmer, she has noticed few things.  The examination hall is a 2-D grid with M rows and N seats in each row. However students in say ,row 1 are the most mischievous and copy the most,But they don't copy from students of other rows as they are afraid of being caught. The N students seated in row 1 are numbered from 1 to N. Also a student in a single row of N seats can only copy from a student sitting either just ahead of him or just behind him .For 1st and last student in the row, they can only copy only from 2nd and 2nd to last student respectively.   Now the supervisor gets bored and starts thinking about how many ways can we select a non-empty subset of those N students in 1st row such that : For each of those selected subsets: (a)There are no two students who can copy from each other. (b)Addition of any of the remaining students in this subset results in copying. Note : Remaining students for a subset means students from 1 to N who are not present in this subset As answers can be large, print it modulo 1000000007(1e9+7).    Sample Explanation :  For N=5,there are 4 valid subsets = ({1,4},{2,4},{1,3,5},{2,5})   Subset {2,5} is valid subset because : 1) Student 2 and student 5 can't copy. So it satisfies property (a) 2) if we add student 1, then student 1 and student 2 will copy     if we add student 3, then student 2 and student 3 will copy     if we add student 4, then student 4 and student 5 will copy    Hence we cant add any of remaining students to this subset.So it satisfies property (b) Similarly {1,4} , {2,4} , {1,3,5} are valid subsets.   Subset {1,5} is not valid because :    if we add student 3 in this subset ,still no one can copy.Hence,it doesn't satisfy property (b). Subset {1,2,5} is not valid because :    Student 1 and student 2 can copy. Hence,it doesn't satisfy property (a). Similarly the remaining 25 subsets for N=5 are invalid.  Thus ,for N=5 , valid subsets(output) = 4     Input  First line will be number of test cases T. Each test case will have a single number N.   Output Number of subsets which satisfy both property (a) and (b) in a single line for each test case    Constraints 1<=T<=10^5 1<=N<=10^6  Example  4 1 2 5 30   Output: 1 2 4 4410   
`Note: Every where quotes are used just for clarity. Please always Ignore them except when mentioned explicitly.    There are N students and one teacher(name: Bhoondu) in a college. Each student is identified by his number K ( 1<=K<=N). Some of them are friends of each others. Friendship relation is equivalence relation, means:  A is friend of A. If A is friend of B then B is friend of A. If A is friend of B and B is friend of C then A is friend of C.  Some other information about the students is that:  If A is friend of B and A knows some thing(any information) then A will tell it to B. If A is NOT friend of B and A knows some thing(any information) then A will NOT tell it to B. If A knows some mistake of B and A is friend of B, A will NOT tell it to Bhoondu. If A knows some mistake of B and A is NOT friend of B , A will tell(complain) it to Bhoondu.  One student S out of these students(1,2,... N) has done a mistake. And one another student K somehow came to know about S's mistake. S DON'T know who is K. Now you have to help S to find out the maximum possible threat to him.  Threat is defined as how many students has complained about S to Bhoondu.  You are also given information about friendship of students in college. It will be given as pairs "A B" which means A is friend of B. Note that some information given to you may be redundant.   Input  First line will contain the number of test cases T. For each test case the first line will contain N S and F separated by space. Where N is the number of students, S is the student who made the mistake and F is the number of friendship information given to you. After this next F lines will contain two numbers A and B separated by space. There is no empty line between different test cases.   Output  For each test case the output will be an integer in a new line, which will be the maximum threat for S in the corresponding test case.   Input Constrain:  1 <= T <= 20 2 <= N <= 1000 0 <= F <= min(N*N,10000) 1 <= S,A,B <= N A != B  Example:  Input: 3 5 1 3 1 2 3 4 3 5 6 2 3 1 2 4 5 5 6 6 1 3 1 2 1 3 5 6  Output: 3 3 2  Explanation:  In 1st test case: If 2 will know about 1's mistake then he will not tell it to Bhoondu because he is his friend so 0 threat. If 3 will know about 1's mistake then he will tell it to 4,5. So three people will complain to Bhoondu, so threat = 3. Case for 4 and 5 is same as 3. So maximum threat = max(0,3,3,3) = 3.  
   There are N players named as 1,2,...,N. Each player has a skill value(call it S) which is a positive integer.  Higher the skill value better the player. All players are standing in a circle in the order 1,2,3...N. Each player have a dispute with some players standing next to him. Players standing next to 1 are {2,3,...,N} and players standing next to N are {1,2,3,...,N-1} You are given N the numbers of players, the skill value S of every player and D the player's dispute number. If the dispute number of a player is D then he has dispute with D players standing right next to him. You have to form a un-disputed(such that no player in the team has dispute with any other player in the team) team with maximum skill. The skill of a team is the sum of skill values of all the players in the team.   Input  First line will contain the number of test cases T. For each test case the first line will contain N, numbers of players. Second line of the test case will contain skill values(S) of all N players separated by space. Third line of the test case will contain the dispute numbers(D) of all N players separated by space. There is no empty line between different test cases.   Output  For each test case the output will be an integer in a new line, which will be the maximum skill of any non disputed team in the corresponding test case.   Input Constrain:  1 <= T <= 20 2 <= N <= 100 1 <= S <= 1000000 (skill value) 0 <= D <= N-1 (dispute number)  Example:  Input: 3 4 4 1 5 3 1 1 2 0 3 2 10 5 1 1 1 4 8 7 4 6 1 1 1 1  Output: 7 10 13  Explanation:  In 1st test case: 1 has dispute with {2}, 2 has dispute with {3}, 3 has dispute with {4,1} and 4 has dispute with none. So possible non disputed teams can be: {1,4} skill=7 {2,3} skill=4 {3}   skill=5 Teams {1}, {2}, {4} are also possible. So maximum skill of any un-disputed team = 7  
 Gandalf is fighting a Balrog in abandoned dwarf city of Moria. Unfortunately he doesn't have much time and want to end fight as soon as possible. As Gandalf is poor in maths you have to help him in forming the strategy. Balrog has power which is denoted by a number X. Gandalf has three types of weapon first one can reduce the power of Balrog to half, another weapon reduces Balrog's power to one third of the current power. The last weapon only reduces Balrog's power by decrementing it by one. To kill Balrog, Gandalf has to reduce his total power to zero by using minimum number of strike.   Input  The first line of input contains a integer T which denotes the number to test cases. After which T lines follows. Every line contains an integer X which denote the initial power of Balrog.   Output  For every test case output a integer in a new line which denotes the minimum number of strikes required to kill Balrog.   Input Constrain:  1 <= T <= 20 2 <= X <= 1000000  Example:  Input: 2 10 19  Output: 4 5  Explanation:  In 1st test case: First use weapon which reduce power by 1. Then use weapon which reduce power to one third twice. Then again the weapon which reduce power by 1. 10-1=9 9/3=3 3/3=1 1-1=0  
 You are given a flow graph G. The flow graph G has N vertices numbered from 1 to N. 1 is Source and N is Sink. There is no incoming edge into Source and no outgoing edge from Sink. There is either edge (u,v) or (v,u) in G. You are also given the capacity of each edges. Assume all capacities are positive integers. You calculated the maximum flow value in G. Now capacity of exactly one edge is increased by some positive integer value but not more than 1000. And you found that there was no change in maximum flow. Now your task is to find out that how many such edges are present in the graph G.   Input  First line will contain two integers N and E separated by space, where N is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. Next E lines will contain 3 integers u, v and c separated by space. Which means is that there is an edge from u to v having capacity c.   Output  You have to output an integer which is the number of edges(one at a time) for which increase in their capacity by not more than 1000 will not lead to increase in maximum flow.   Input Constrain:  2 <= N <= 50 1 <= E <= Maximum possible edges in graph u != v 1 <= c <= 100000   Example:  Input: 4 5 1 2 8 1 3 10 2 3 5 2 4 2 3 4 3  Output: 3  Explanation:  Increasing the capacity of edge (1,2),(1,3) and (2,3) (INDIVIDUALLY) does not have any effect on maximum flow.

Tom started his coding in python and he never used C language for coding. Today he started to learn C language but unlike python C language contains semicolon in the end of the statement.Tom is a beginner in C language so he doesn't know more keywords in c language.Tom uses only few keywords in his C code.Because of using Python Tom strictly follow indentation in his code. Now Tom wants to count no. of semicolon mistakes in his C code.  Rules where we use semicolon in C language code -  In general in the end of each line we use semicolon.  If line contains while, for, if, else and data type function-name(arguments) we will not use semicolon.We will use only int, void, float and char for data type.  We don't use semicolon after "{" and "}" symbol.  We will not use semicolon at the end of line if line contains "#" symbol in the starting of statement.  We will use "//" to indicates the end of program. Tom needs your help in making of this compiler.     Input Given a C language code.    Output Print the no. of semicolon mistakes in given C languge code.    Example Input: #include "stdio.h" int main() {   printf("hello world")   return 0; } //  Output: 1    Explanation Example case 1. In line 3 after printf statement a semicolon is missing so answer will be 1.

  Alan plans a heist to rob a bank. The bank has  N vaults containing money .Each vault is numbered from 1 to N. The ith vault of the bank contains rupees i. All the vaults are initially closed. But since the bank contains so much money, it has routine security checks in the following manner:    N security guards enter the bank.                                                                                                 The first security guard opens all the vaults.                                                                                    The second security guard closes every second vault.                                                                                       The third security guard opens every third vault.                                                                                In this manner, the ith security guard reverses the state(open or closed) of every ith vault in the bank. Alan enters the bank after all N security guards have finished their routine check. He can only rob all the open vaults. But before he commits the robbery, Alan decides to calculate the total amount of money he can rob. But since Alan is weak in mathematics, he asks you for help. Your task is to calculate the total amount of money Alan can rob from the bank.  (It is obvious that Alan can only steal money from all the OPEN vaults.)   Input The first line of input will contain an integer T which denotes the number of test cases. The next T lines will each have a positive whole number number N, denoting the number of vaults in the bank and also the Number of Guards that will be doing the routine check.   Output For each test case, Output a single line containing the total amount of money Alan can rob from the bank.  Constraints :  1 ≤ N ≤ 1000 (30 Points) 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^12(40 Points) (Easier Test Cases) 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^12(30 Points)     Example Input: 235  Output: 15    Explanation In the first case, there are 3 vaults. The vault which is open after 3 guards  do the routine check is only Vault Number 1. Hence Amount which can be stolen is 1. In the second case, There are 5 vaults. After 5 security guards enter, the open vaults are number 1 and number 4. Since the ith vault has i rupees, the amount which can be stolen is 1+4=5.  TIPS The input and output format is to be Strictly Followed.Each output will consist of a single line containing the required sum. Errors in inputting or outputting the numbers in the required format will make a correct solution give a Wrong Answer also! 
  Ramanujan loves to play with numbers. He once asked everyone in his class a question : “Given a Number N, what is the smallest number which can be formed whose product of DIGITS will be equal to N?  For example if N is 100 the number is 455.” His friend pointed out to him that there are certain numbers which cannot be formed in this manner. Ramanujan took due note of that and told everyone in his class to try solving this problem through programming. Your task is to Print the Smallest Number Whose Product of Digits is Equal to N. If there is no such number, you MUST print -1.     Input The First Line of Input will contain an Integer T, Denoting the Number of Test Cases.                                Each of the next T lines , each , will have a positive whole number N.  Output For each Test Case, Print on a new line the smallest number whose product of digits is N. If there is no such number print -1.  Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 10^3 (30 Points) 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^16 (70 Points)     Example Input: 3100139  Output: 455-119    Explanation In the first case, the smallest number whose product of digits is 100 is 455 as 4*5*5=100. For the second case there are no numbers in which the product of digits will give us the original number. So we print -1. For the third case 9 can be represented as 1*9 hence number is 19.  The Input and Output Format must be Strictly Followed. 
  As we all know, a substring is a contiguous subsequence of characters of a word. For example, the substrings of the word cat would be c,a,t,ca,at,cat. Given a String  S composed of only lower case characters, and a substring  X  also of lower case characters, your job is to remove all occurrences of X from S .    For example, if the String is “banana” and the substring is an, the resulting String would be “ba”.                                                                                                       If the resulting String has zero length, print “0” (without quotes).     Input The first Line of Input will contain an Integer T, Denoting the number of Test Cases. The next 2T  Lines will contain two Strings  S and X, alternatively.  Output For each test case, print the resulting String on a new line.  Constraints Should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have.

It is advised to use BufferedReader for this problem.  
  BILLIARDS is a really interesting game. It is played on a green baize with 3 balls-red, white and yellow. Sheldon and Leonard are playing a game of billiards. Sheldon is playing the game for the first time and is not familiar with the rules. So he asks Leonard to explain the rules to him. Leonard explains the rules to Sheldon in the following way:“A Cannon shot gives 2 points and an In-Off Shot gives 3 points.” Sheldon is curious, and wants to figure out that given a score X, in how many ways can he get that score by hitting a combination of Cannon and In-Off shots?Leonard is baffled when he is asked this question. Your task is to help Leonard in writing a program to compute the total number of ways one can score a total of X points by hitting any combination of Cannon and In-Off shots. The order in which the shots are hit have importance. For example, 5 can be scored in two ways, by hitting an In-Off Shot followed by a Cannon shot or a Cannon Shot followed by an In-Off shot. A score of 7 can be achieved in three ways – Cannon,In-Off,Cannon   Cannon,Cannon,In-Off    and    In-Off,Cannon,Cannon.     Input The first line of input will contain an integer T which denotes the number of test cases. 1<=T<=2000 The next  T  lines will each have a positive integer X, denoting the score which has to be achieved.   Output For each test case, Output a single line containing the  total number of ways one can score a score of X by hitting only Cannon and In-Off shots. Since the number can be very large, Output the answer MOD 1000000009(10^9+9)  Constraints  1 ≤ X ≤ 10^3 (30 Points) 1 ≤ X ≤ 10^6 (70 Points)     Example Input: 3572  Output: 231    Explanation Explanations of the first two cases are mentioned above. In the third case, a score of 2 can be achieved by hitting a cannon.  The Input and Output Format must be STRICTLY FOLLOWED 
 There is a Cartesian plane. Four points on it represent the houses of Elena Gilbert, Bonnie Bennett, Damon Salvatore and Caroline Forbes. Now, Elena is going to Damon’s home and Bonnie to Caroline’s. Both walk with same speed and they live in a wind free area. Now, you have to tell if they can meet in the way, anyhow..?? Note: They can meet only if their paths cross each other’s.   Input  First line will contain the number of test cases. First line of each test case will contain two numbers x and y, x being x coordinate and y being y coordinate of Bonnie’s place. Similarly second, third and fourth line will contain Caroline’s, Damon’s and Elena’s address respectively.  Output  For each test case there will be just one line of output, “yes” or “no”.   Example  Input: 1 0.0 0.0 4.4 4.0 1.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 Output: yes 
There are n children who have landed up in an unknown place where they find just some jar of cookies to eat. They also have a dog with them. The children gather all the cookies and put them in a big jar. Exhausted, they agree to go and wait until the next morning to divide up the cookies. At one o'clock in the morning, the first child wakes up. He realizes that he can't trust the others, and decides to take his share now. He divides the cookies into n equal shares, but there is one left over. He gives that cookie to the dog, hides his cookies, and puts the rest of the cookies back. At two o'clock, the second child wakes up. Not realizing that the first child has already taken his share, he too divides the cookies up into n shares, leaving one over which he gives to the dog. He then hides his share, and puts the remainder back. At three, four, five…… ‘n’ o'clock in the morning, the third, fourth, fifth …….nth children each wake up and carry out the same actions. In the morning, all the children wake up, and try to look innocent. No one makes a remark about the diminished share of cookies, and no one decides to be honest and admit that they've already taken their share. Instead, they divide the share up into nshares, for the (n+1)th time, and find that there is yet again one cookie left over, which they give to the dog. You have to find out how many cookies were present originally in the jar.  Input  The input will contain several numbers of test cases. The first line will contain the number of test cases(x) followed by ‘x’ lines of inputs which contains the values of ‘n’.  Output  For each input print the number of cookies present in the jar.   Example  Input: 2 5 6   Output: 15621 279931  
At the legendary times of Nonsenso wars in ISM Dhanbad, there was a neck to neck competition between Barney Stinson and Sheldon Cooper. They both were on level 19. After trying too hard both of them could not decipher the nonsense, so they decided to play alongside. Sheldon Cooper had to pass a message to Barney Stinson. So he decided to convert each letter of the sentence to their corresponding to their ASCII codes. When Barney received the message he could not get anything. Now you have to design a code which converts the encrypted message to readable format.   Input The input will consist of the first line containing the number of test cases ‘n’ followed by n lines of test cases.  Output  For each input print the decoded line.  Example  Input: 2 721011081081113287111114108100 871011089911110910132116111327311010010597   Output: Hello World Welcome to India  
 A large company wishes to monitor the cost of phone calls made by its personnel. To achieve this the PABX logs, for each call, the number called (a string of up to 15 digits) and the duration in minutes. Write a program to process this data and produce a report specifying each call and its cost, based on standard Telecom charges. International (IDD) numbers start with two zeroes (00) followed by a country code (1-3 digits) followed by a subscriber's number (4-10 digits). National (STD) calls start with one zero (0) followed by an area code (1-5 digits) followed by the subscriber's number (4-7 digits). The price of a call is determined by its destination and its duration. Local calls start with any digit other than 0 and are free.    Input  Input will be in two parts. The first part will be a table of IDD and STD codes, localities and prices as follows: Code * Locality name$price in cents per minute where * represents a space. Locality names are 25 characters or less. This section is terminated by a line containing 6 zeroes (000000). The second part contains the log and will consist of a series of lines, one for each call, containing the number dialled and the duration. The file will be terminated a line containing a single #. The numbers will not necessarily be tabulated, although there will be at least one space between them. Telephone numbers will not be ambiguous.   Output  Output will consist of the called number, the country or area called, the subscriber's number, the duration, the cost per minute and the total cost of the call, as shown below. Local calls are costed at zero. If the number has an invalid code, list the area as ``Unknown'' and the cost as -1.00.

 Brunno Doiuna is very fond of caper pizzas, which he always likes to share with his girlfriend. As she also loves capers, it is of the utmost importance, in order to avoid unnecessary quarrels, to split the pizza into two equally-sized slices in such a way that each half contains exactly the same number of capers. However, most caper pizzas also contain a number of peppercorns, and neither Brunno nor his girlfriend likes them. Therefore, it is also crucial that each of the two halves contain the same number of peppercorns. As you can easily observe, depending on the position of capers and peppercorns on the pizza, it is not always possible to make a straight-line cut into the pizza in such a way that the two slices have the same area and the same number of capers and peppercorns lie in each resulting piece. Your task is to design a program to decide if it is possible to make such a cut or not, knowing the positions of capers and peppercorns.   Input We will assume that the pizza is circular and is centered at the origin, and is big enough to contain all capers and peppercorns. We also assume that there is an even number of capers and an even number of peppercorns, and that no cut goes through any of the capers or pepper balls. Additionally, no pair of peppercorns, capers, or a peppercorn and a caper are aligned with the origin, or form an angle of less than 10-6 degrees with the origin. There can be multiple test cases, one after the other. The first line of a test case contains two even integers c>=0 and p>=0 (where 2<=c + p<=30000) separated by a space, the number of capers and peppercorns, respectively. Each of the following c lines describes the position of a caper using two floating point numbers, separated by a space, representing its x and y coordinates. Each of the next p lines holds two floating point numbers, the x and y coordinates of a peppercorn. A blank line follows each test case.  The last line of input will contain `-1 -1'. This marks the end of input -- do not write any output for this special last line.   Output  `YES' for a positive answer, `NO' otherwise.   Example  Input: 2 2 1 1 1 0 0 1 -1 1  2 2 1 1 -1 1 0 1 0.1 -1  -1 -1  Output: NO YES  
  Today, Mr. Joseph, our maths professor, taught us about the Fibonacci sequence and its applications in various places. He concluded the lesson by giving us a computational problem, which he stated as simple.  You are given two non-negative integers X and Y, you have to calculate the sum  (F(X) + F(X + 1) + ... + F(Y)) mod 1000000007, where F(N)=F(N-1)+F(N-2),N ≥ 2.     Input The first line contains an integer T (the number of test cases). Then, T lines follow. Each test case consists of a single line with two non-negative integers X and Y.    Output For each test case you have to output a single line containing the answer. Since the answer can be huge i.e go out of the bounds of integers, You are required to print the answer MOD 10^9+7    Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 1000 0 ≤ X ≤ Y ≤ 1000     Example Input: 3 2 6 3 5 10 19 170 725 Output: 19 10 10857 901453553  Explanation The fibonacci series goes like this 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21,.... For the first test case, we need to calculate the sum of the Fibonacci series from its 2nd term till 6th. ( i.e 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 ) = 19%(10^9+7) == 19 NOTE:  Use long int or long long int for data storage to avoid overflow.  HINT:  From the 100th term onward, the fibonacci numbers become too large to be stored in any integer in C or C++.  GIVEAWAY:  ( a + b + c + ...)%m = ( a%m + b%m +c%m + ....)%m    
  A quiz show rates participants according to their level intelligence. Two different quiz shows were organized, one for boys and the other for girls. Now the results of both quiz shows are out. The participants of both the shows have decided to date each other, but as usual they have difficulty in choosing their partners. The Maximum Match dating service (MMDS) comes to their rescue and matches them in such a way that that maximizes the intelligence bonds for all couples. If a boy has been rated at intelligence level x and a girl at intelligence level y, the value of their intelligence bond is x*y. Both shows contain N participants each. MMDS has done its job and your job is to find the sum of intelligence bonds for all the couples that MMDS has proposed.     Input The first line of the input contains an integer t, the number of test cases. t test cases follow.  Each test case consists of 3 lines:   The first line contains a single integer N (1 <= N <= 1000).   The second line contains N integers separated by single spaces denoting the intelligence levels of the boys.   The third line contains N integers separated by single spaces denoting the intelligence levels of the girls  . All intelligence ratings are on a scale of 0 to 10.   Output For each test case output a single line containing a single integer denoting the sum of the intelligence bonds for all pairs that MMDS has proposed.  Constraints  N ( 1 ≤ N<=1000)  All intelligence ratings are on a scale of 0 to 10.      Example Input: 2 2 1 1 3 2 3 2 3 2 1 3 2   Output: 5 15    
 Dhoni is fondly known as Mr. Cool but he is in a lot of trouble these days. The opposing batsmen are constantly scoring runs. Thus Dhoni is worried about when to take a powerplay such that runs scored by the opposite teams can be minimized. More precisely, he wants to take a powerplay in those stretch of the overs in which XOR  of the runs (in those overs) scored by the opposing team is minimum. Now Dhoni is able to guess the strategy of opposition teams and the amount of runs they intend to score in each over. He has found out that runs scored by the opposing team from over 'i' (Oi) to over 'j' (Oj) is the XOR  (not sum) of all runs between Oi and Oj (i, j inclusive). The match consists of N overs for each team and there is one single powerplay of Z overs. Note  :   The runs scored in a powerplay from over 'i' to over 'j' is NOT sum but XOR of the runs scored in the individual overs. And if there is more than one possibility of choosing a powerplay then prefer the later overs. Can you help the Mr. Cool in deciding when to take the powerplay?  Input  First line of the input will have T (number of test cases). Then for each test case first line will have two integers N and Z. The second line (of each test case) will have a list of N integers [O1, O2, ..., ON] which are the runs the opposing team intends to score in that respective over of the match.   Output  For each test case, output a single integer denoting from which over Dhoni should start the powerplay.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ Z ≤ N ≤ 10^4 0 ≤ Oi ≤ 10^12   Example Input 1 3 2 1 2 3  Output 2   Explanation  Runs in over 1 and 2 :  1 XOR 2 = 3 Runs in over 2 and 3 :  2 XOR 3 = 1 Since runs scored from over 1 to 2 is more than those in over 2 to 3, Dhoni should take powerplay from 2nd over itself. 
 This time Dhoni has developed a passion for strings. Dhoni has an integer N and infinite supply of the characters 'A','B' and 'C'. Dhoni wants to know how many beautiful strings of length N can be generated by using these characters. A string is considered as beautiful if it does not have "ABC" as its substring. But he does not know how to code so he is asking you to help him. Since this number may be quite large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.  Input  First line of input contains the number of test cases T.  Each of next T lines contain an integer N.    Output  For each test case, output the number of beautiful strings of length N.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤  10 1 ≤  N ≤  10^5   Example Input : 2 2 3  Output : 9 26   Explanation :  In the 1st test case, all 9 possible strings are beautiful as none of them have "ABC" as a substring. Hence the answer is 9.  In the 2nd test case, total 27 strings of length 3 are possible and only string “ABC” is not beautiful. Hence the answer is 26.  
 Virat is a guy who likes solving problems very much. Today Virat’s friend Jadega gave him a problem to solve. Jadeja gives Virat three numbers: N, L and R and Virat has to find out the count of numbers between L and R (both inclusive) which are divisible by at least 1 prime number belonging to range 1 to N (inclusive). Though Virat likes to solve problems, this one seems too hard for him to solve. So he turns to you in order to solve the problem. Now it is your job to solve this problem for Virat.  Input  First line of input contains number of test cases T. Each of next T lines contain 3 space separated integers:  N,L and R as described in the problem statement.   Output  For each test case, print a single line having the count of numbers between L and R (both inclusive) which are divisible by at least 1 prime number belonging to range 1 to N (inclusive).   Constraints  1 ≤ T   ≤ 10 2 ≤ N ≤ 50 1 ≤ L ≤  R ≤ 10^18   Example Input 2 6 1 15 10 17 29  Output 11 9   Explanation  In the 1st test case, primes in the range 1 to 6 are 2, 3 and 5. The numbers in the range 1 to 15 which are divisible by any of 2,3 or 5 are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15 (total 11).  In the 2nd test case, prime in the range 1 to 10 are 2, 3, 5 and 7. The number in the range 17 to 29 which are divisible by any of these primes are 18, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 (total 9).  
 There is going to be a Cricket match tonight for which N guests are invited. There are 9 rows, numbered from 1 to 9 in the stadium, each having several seats. Each row as well as each guest has some priority. Note:  Guest 1 is to be prioritized more than guest 2. Similarly guest 2 is to be more prioritized than guest 3 and so on. Row 1 is superior to row2. Similarly row 2 is superior to row 3 and so on.   Arrangement Criteria:   All the guests should get a seat of their choice. Each guest has a set of preferred rows in which they want a seat.    So now your work comes into play. :P You need to arrange them in different rows of their choice. No, its not that easy...you also need to prioritize. :) You need to find an arrangement in which guest 1 gets the seat in the best row possible out of his choice satisfying the arrangement criteria. Then you need to assign best seat to guest 2 and so on. So your task is to generate an arrangement prioritizing guests from 1 to N in a way such that it always complies with the arrangement criteria.  Input  First line consists of a number N. Next line will have 9 space separated integers, A1 to A9, denoting empty seats in each of the 9 rows respectively. This is followed by N lines, each of the form K followed by K space separated integers B1 to BK  denoting the seat preference of each guest from 1 to N.   Output  Print the N integers denoting the row number for each guest. If no arrangement is possible, print "It seems MSG" without quotes.   Constraints 1 ≤  N  ≤ 100 1  ≤ K  ≤ 9 0  ≤ Ai  ≤ 9 1  ≤ Bi   ≤ 9  Example Input 5 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 5 1 2 3 4 5 1 1 5 1 2 3 4 5 5 1 2 3 4 5 5 1 2 3 4 5  Output 2 1 3 4 5   Explanation  Guest 1 should be allotted row 1 but as guest 2 has only row 1 as preference so we will not be able to arrange them. So guest 2 will be allotted row 1. Then Guest 1 will be allotted Row 2 followed by row 3 to guest 3, row 4 to guest 4 and row 5 to guest 5 as guest 3 has high priority than Guest 4 and Guest 5.  
  Nitesh recently discovered a new game CODATHON with the help of a very intelligent alien friend Jupiter. In this game a student had various challenges and each challenge had infinite number of problems. The scoring system in this game was quite different. There are 2 ways of scoring on a given problem:  If you are in the first 200 to submit solution you get +a points,  In all other cases you get +b points,  Note : a,b are different for every challenge.   Now for a particular challenge with scores a and b, Nitesh wants to find out the largest score that is not possible to achieve. Also Nitesh decided not to make a>b always ( after all Jupiter suggested it & nobody knows why !!! :P ).    Input First Line of Input Contains T, Number of testcases, Each testcase has 2 numbers a and b.    Output For each testcase output the largest score which is not possible to achieve in a new line. If all scores are achievable print 'infinite solutions' without quotes. NOTE : The output in some cases can be extremely large, therefore print it modulo 10^9+7.    Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10^9 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^18 1 ≤ b ≤ 10^18     Example Input: 2 3 4 5 7  Output: 5 23    Explanation Example case 1: With a=3 and b=4, except 5 all scores are possible: eg. 6 = 3 + 3        7 = 3 + 4        8 = 4 + 4 and so on.

 Many years ago there was a kingdom called 'sentence', which comprises of two groups namely strings and integers. Strings consists of all the characters and alphabets(both capital and small) whereas the integers consists of all the kinds of numbers. 'A' was the leader of strings and was prefer over '0' the leader of integers by the people of the kingdom. King of the sentences was very old, so he kept a competition for deciding the next king. In the competition only 'A' and '0' participated. '0' knew that he was going to lose in the competition so he attacked on the strings. String 'X' came running to 'A' and told him that '0' is going to kill all the strings. 'A ' is terrified and wants to protect his group. He knows that if he wants to stop '0' he needs to remove all the integers from kingdom. So he asks your help in killing all the integers. Help 'A' in removing all the integers from the kingdom and hence protect all the strings.  Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.  Next T lines contain a sentence 'S' formed from integers and strings. The length of S is denoted by L. (it is guaranteed that after killing all the integers, L>0).   Output  Print the sentence consisting of only strings in the given order.    Constraints  2 < T < 1000 2 < L < 10000   Example Input: 2 CodeVaitam 2015@Nit agartala. Codechef  Output: CodeVaitam @Nit agartala. Codechef

 There were four friends who used to live together in 19th century in South California. Each of them knew to solve only one kind of mathematical operator. One day, walking by a temple, they found a metal piece with N numbers engraved on it. When they showed it to the priest, he suggested that it might be an indication of the coordinates of a treasure. He also suggested that it can be cracked by performing the basic mathematical operators (/, *, +, -) in such a fashion that the operators be inserted between the numbers in the order given above and after the operators are inserted in one iteration, in the next iteration the start of the next insertion starts from the next operator from which it was inserted in previous iteration.

  Everyone knows the famous detective Sherlock. He has been handed over a new case of "The Abominable Bride". Each night she kills N people but to irritate Sherlock she leaves exactly one people. The way she kills the people is somewhat strange. She makes 1 to N people stand in a line and starts killing them. But, in the line when she kills the first person, there's time for the person standing next in line to run away at the end of the line.Again she kills the first person and the second one next to him runs to the last of the line. In this way after killing, there is exactly one person standing in the line who is saved and he runs to Sherlock to explain the situation each night. Help Sherlock find out the person that will be saved at the end of the massacre.  Constraints and Example Input: 5 2 4 6 9 12  Output: 2 4 4 2 8   Explanation  For the 2nd test case, she kills 1 and 2 goes at the end of line i.e., 3 4 2. Then she kills 3rd and 4th goes at the end of line i.e. 2 4. Then she kills 2 and ultimately 4th is the lone survivour.

Lucky bank is very famous for it's schemes. Each year the Manager of the Lucky bank comes up with a new scheme. There are N customers each having a locker in the Lucky bank, i th customer has a locker with locker number i. Initially there was no money in their lockers. It has been one year since Lucky bank is established. Yes, today is it's anniversary. So, The Manager of the bank wants to make the customers happy.  He comes up with a new scheme. The scheme is as follows:If the i th customer (having locker number: i ) deposits  M $ in his locker, Then all the lockers numbered 2*i ,3*i ,4*i........j*i where j*i <=N    will also be deposited with M $. No wonder, who won't be happy with such a scheme? There are two types of queries TYPE1 Query:- 	UPDATE K M 	This means that customer with locker number K deposits M $ in his account. TYPE2 Query:- 	ASK  K 	Customer K wants to know the money present in his locker (Customer K has locker number K).  INPUT:- First line of the input contains a single integer N , No. of customers.Second line of the input contains a single integer Q, Number of queries.Then Q lines follow, each with a query of a TYPE1 or TYPE2  OUTPUT:- Output the money in the locker of the customer in a new line if the query is of TYPE2  Constraints:- 1<=k<=n<=100000 1<=q<=10000 1<=m<=100000  Sample Input : 10 5 UPDATE 1 10 UPDATE 3 3 UPDATE 2 10 ASK 6 ASK 10  Sample Output : 23 20  Explanation:- When customer with locker number 1 deposits 10$ in his locker, Then all the customers with locker numbers 2*1,3*1......will also get 10$.Similarly when, customer 3 deposits 3$ in his account, then all the customers with locker numbers 6,9 will also get 3$.Similarly with UPDATE 2 10.Hence ASK 6 gives 23 as the output.

In a country, a person's health and wealth is measured in terms of time(seconds) left. Suppose a person there has 24x60x60 = 86400 seconds left, then he would live for another 1 day. A person dies when his time left becomes 0. Some time-amount can be borrowed from other person, or time banks. Some time amount can also be lend to another person, or can be used to buy stuffs. The president of that country is in very critical condition and has very less time left. A bank is giving away free time amount worth 1000 years. Bank released N slips, A[1],A[2],...A[N]. Each slip has a time amount(can be +ve or -ve). A person can pick any number of slips(even none, or all of them, or some of them) out of the N slips. But bank introduced a restriction, they announced one more number K. Restriction is that, if a person picks a slip A[i], then the next slip that he can choose to pick will be A[i+K+1]. It means there should be a difference of atleast K between the indices of slips picked. Now slip(s) should be picked in such a way that their sum results in maximum positive time-amount sum possible with the given restriction. If you predict the maximum positive sum possible, then you win.   Input Format   First line of the test file contains single number T, the number of test cases to follow. Each test case consists of two lines. First line contains two numbers N and K , separated by a space. Second line contains the N numbers A[1], A[2] ..... A[N] separated by space.

Raju loves to play logical games,One fine day his friend Gopi came to his home and told him about a game known as game of dots which his professor asked him in his maths class.As Gopi knew that raju is very passionate about solving logical problems so he decided to play the game with him.Gopi started telling the rules of the game to raju which goes like this- The game is played on a square field consisting of n × n cells. Initially all cells are empty. On each turn a player chooses and put a dot in an empty cell that has no common sides with previously dotted cells. Adjacent corner of dotted cells is allowed. On the next turn another player does the same, then the first one and so on. The player with no cells to put a dot on his turn loses the game. Gopi have chosen the field size n and allowed Raju to choose to be the first or the second player in the game. What should you choose for Raju to let him win the game? Both players play optimally.   Input The only line of the input contains one integer n  — the size of the field.  Output  Output number 1, if Raju making the first turn wins when both Raju and Gopi play optimally, otherwise print number 2.

ALICE and BOB are playing a game with strings. Both of them have a string of length N consisting of lower case characters only.   A permutation of “abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz” is given in the input that defines the POWER of the characters (a-z). The position of the character starting from the left defines the POWER of a character. The position of the leftmost character is taken to be 0. If a character is common to both the strings, it is destroyed. The powers of the leftout characters of each of the strings are added separately.  If a character is repeated, then power of only one such character is added. Person with the string of HIGHER POWER wins.   ALICE and BOB want to check if you are smart enough to declare the winner in advance!! Are you ready? ;)   Input The first line of the input contains an integer T, denoting the length of the conversation, and the string M, denoting a permutation of the string "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" which defines the power of characters. T and M are separated by exactly one space. The description of T test cases follows.

   The Chef is fond of polynomials so he decides to fix the rate of the food items in the form of a polynomial equation for his hotel. He decides to put the rate of the items in the form of coefficients of the polynomial where, if the  rate of tea is "a1" and rate of sandwich is "a2”  and so on, then the rate list will be in the form of a0 *x^0+ a1 *x^1.......aN-1 *x^(N-1). But his competitor Ciel copies this policy .In the same way, Ciel also designs a polynomial rate list for his hotel. But this makes the condition miserable for both of them as the profit gets divided in an unbalanced form. So both of them decide to multiply the coefficient of their polynomial and get a resultant polynomial. They put the resultant list on their rate boards. But they are weak in mathematics so help them to do this task!!     Input First line of the Input contains T, the number of test cases.  Each test case is given as follows: Two space separated integers ,  N1 and N2 which denote the degree of polynomials of Chef and Ciel respectively.

Bob has recently learnt how to play basketball and he was told by Alice that the rules in basketball were as follows : • 1 point for a free throw • 2 points for a throw from within the D • 3 points for a throw from outside the D Being an inquisitive mind that Bob is, he would like to know how many combinations of 1-pointers, 2-pointers and 3-pointers can lead to a team score of N points. Now if a team has scored enough points, Bob wouldn't be able to remember the number of possible combinations long enough to show-off in front of your friends. So you decide to keep track of result modulo 100001. Help Bob to compute the number of combinations of 1-pointers, 2-pointers and 3-pointers that can lead to a team score of N points.   Input The first line contains single integer T - the number of test cases. T test cases follow.For each test case input will just be a number which denotes the team score N.  Output Output should be number of combinations of 1-pointers, 2-pointers and 3-pointers that can lead to the given team score modulo 100001.  Constraints 1 ≤ T ≤ 100 0 ≤ N < 10^8  Sum of all the N's across a test file doesn't exceed 10^8.   Example Input: 4 8 12 1033 894755  Output: 10 19 89441 22727    Explanation Example case 1:For the 1st test case,following are the possible combinations for team score of 8 1x8 1x6 + 2x1 1x4 + 2x2 1x2 + 2x3 2x4 1x5 + 3x1 1x3 + 2x1 + 3x1 1x1 + 2x2 + 3x1 1x2 + 3x2 2x1 + 3x2  NOTE : Use fast Input Output. 
Its the 22nd century and the terror of Codezilla is at its height. Codezilla is the most evil and dangerous hacker that ever existed. He has broken all systems of governance and the world has descended into anarchy. Eon, a young hacker, is fed up with the situation and has decided to put an end to Codezilla.   Eon meets a mysterious man called Cypher who is on the same mission. He tells Eon that to fight against Codezilla first he needs to get out of the real world and enter the Matrix. For this he needs to take some pills.  Cypher gives a set of pills to Eon. There are three types of pills: Blue,Red and Green. Eon can select any number of consecutive pills but he must take atleast one red pill, one blue pill and one green pill to enter the matrix. As eating more pills can be harmful, help Eon select the minimum number of pills.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each of the next T lines contains a string depicting the set of pills. Each character of the string is 'B', 'R' or 'G' standing for blue, red and green pills respectively.  Output For every test case, print in a single line the minimum number of consecutive pills that Eon should take so that he gets atleast one pill of each colour.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 3 ≤ Length of string ≤ 100000 The input string will contain atleast one each of 'B', 'R' and 'G'.     Example Input: 2 BBRG RGGGBBR  Output: 3 4  Explanation Example case 1. Eon selects the pills from 2 to 4, so he takes 3 pills. Example case 2. Eon can select 5 pills from 1 to 5 or he can select 4 pills from 4 to 7. So the answer is 4. 
Eon is still on his quest to defeat Codezilla but he is stuck. He has reached a secret vault which according to Cypher, contains valuable information about Codezilla's information systems. But the vault is password locked. Till now Eon has been able to decipher the following things about the password:  Maximum possible length of the password The string S such that each character of the password is smaller than or equal to the corresponding character of S. password[i]<=S[i] ( 0 <= i < |S| ). Also the password will be lexicographically smaller than S. The password consists of only small English alphabets 'a' to 'z'.   Now Eon makes a brute force program to enter all possible passwords. Tell him the maximum number of attempts he would have to make to get the correct password.   NOTE : The string A = A1...AN is called lexicographically smaller than the string B = B1...BN if there exists K from 1 to N, inclusive, such that Ai = Bi for i = 1, ..., K-1, and AK < BK. We compare small letters by their positions in the English alphabet. So 'a' is the smallest letter, 'b' is the second smallest letter, ..., 'z' is the largest letter.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains the maximum possible length of the password L and the second line contains the string S.  Output For every test case, print in a single line the answer for the corresponding input. Since the answer can be very large, print the answer modulo 1000000007.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ |S| ≤ 10000 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9   Example Input: 2 2 b 3 abc  Output: 27 8  Explanation Example case 1. Eon will need to enter "a","aa","ab","ac","ad",..."az". So answer is 27. Example case 2. Eon will need to enter "a","aa","aaa","aab","aac","ab","aba","abb". So the answer is 8. 
In the secret vault, Eon gets information about the existence of Codezilla's castle and he finds a map with its location. But on his way to the castle, Eon encounters a maze. Now this is no ordinary maze. The maze is in the form of a rectangle with n rows and m columns. Each cell of the maze is a room and a room in the ith row and jth column is addressed as room(i,j). Rows are numbered from 1 to n from bottom to top and columns are numbered from 1 to m from left to right. The maze has two types of rooms: type A and type B. In each room of type A, there is a monster who is very hungry and Eon must give him a candy otherwise the monster will eat him. The room also contains one gold coin. In each room of type B, there is a guard who is very greedy and Eon must give him a gold coin otherwise the guard will kill him. The room also contains a candy. Every room has a door to every adjacent room (Rooms that share an edge are adjacent rooms). Before entering the maze Eon has the choice of taking either a gold coin or a candy. Eon enters the maze from room(1,1) and he has to reach the room(n,m) to get out of the maze. Eon does not have much time. Tell Eon the minimum number of rooms he needs to visit to get out of the maze alive.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. First line of each test case consists of two integers n and m.Then follows n lines with m characters each describing the maze. '0' for room of type A and '1' for room of type B.  Output For every test case print the minimum number of rooms Eon needs to visit to get out of the maze. If it is not possible to cross the maze, print "-1" without the quotes.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000     Example Input: 2 3 3 011 001 000 2 2 11 00  Output: 5 -1 
After crossing the maze, Eon has finally reached Codezilla's castle. But entering the castle is not going to be so easy. In his early days, Codezilla used to be an ace competitive programmer. He knew such a day would come when someone like Eon will rise against him. So instead of a password, Codezilla has set a programming problem to enter the castle. The puzzle is as follows: You are given three integers N,X and M. Then there are M queries each containing two integers L and R. For each query you have to print the count of numbers Y such that L<=Y<=R and GCD(N,Y)=X. Eon has always been more into development rather than competitive programming. So help him solve the puzzle.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. First line of each test case consists of three integers N, X and M. Each of the next M lines contains two integers L and R.  Output Print the answer of each query in a separate line.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^9 1 ≤ X ≤ N ≤ 10^9 1 ≤ M ≤ 1000 1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ 10^9   Example Input: 1 10 2 2 1 10 5 5  Output: 4 0  Explanation Example case 1. From 1 to 10, there are 4 numbers 2, 4, 6 and 8 such that their GCD with 10 is 2. 
Now its time for the final battle between Eon and Codezilla. There are N weapons available numbered from 1 to N. The cost of weapon i is C[i] (1<=i<=N). There will be M attacks. In each attack Eon will choose K weapons from the range of weapons numbered between L and R (both inclusive). All weapons have the same damage power. Eon wants to spend the minimum amount possible for each attack .Tell Eon the amount that he will need to spend for each attack.  Input First line of the input contains an integer N. The next line contains N space separated integers representing the array C representing the cost of the weapons. Next line contains an integer M. Each of the next M lines contains three integers L, R and K.  Output Output should consists of M lines. The i'th line should contain the minimum amount that Eon needs to spend for the i'th attack. Since the answer can be large, output the answer modulo 10^9+7.  Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 20000 1 ≤ M ≤ 20000 1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ N 1 ≤ K ≤ R-L+1 1 ≤ C[i] ≤ 10^9   Example Input: 5 9 3 5 3 1 2 1 3 2 2 5 3  Output: 8 7  Explanation Example case 1. Eon will choose the weapons 2 and 3. So the answer is 3+5=8. Example case 2.  Eon will choose the weapons 2, 4 and 5. So the answer is 1+3+3=7 
  Ki and Ka like to play the game tower of Hanoi. One day Ki challenges Ka to build the tallest tower from a set of disks of different height and radius. The tower of Hanoi can be built by stacking disks on top of each other. In order to put disk A on top of disk B, the radius and height of A must be strictly smaller than those of B. Help Ka to win the challenge.    Input First line of input contains number of test cases T. First line of each test case contains value of N, the number of disks.

Working from left-to-right if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its left it is called an increasing number; for example, 22344. Similarly if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its right it is called a decreasing number; for example, 774410 we shall call a positive integer that is neither increasing nor decreasing a “bouncy” number; for example, 155349.WAP to check whether a number is bouncy or not.  Input The input consists of one number given as input at a time,the program checks if the number is bouncy or not.The number of test cases have to be specified in the first input.  Output The output displays whether the number is bouncy or not,i.e it displays 1 when the number is bouncy and 0 when its not. Input: 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 150  Output: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 
It can be seen that the number, 125874, and its double, 251748, contain exactly the same digits, but in a different order. WAP to check that if 2 such numbers have this property  Input: The first line will consist of the total number of test cases T(1 ≤ T ≤ 10). The next T lines will consist of one number on each line.

A Discrete Mathematics professor has a class of NN students. Frustrated with their lack of discipline, he decides to cancel class if fewer than KK students are present when class starts. Given the arrival time of each student, determine if the class is canceled. Input Format The first line of input contains TT, the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line has two space-separated integers, NN (students in the class) and KK (the cancelation threshold). The second line contains NN space-separated integers (a1,a2,…,aNa1,a2,…,aN) describing the arrival times for each student. Note: Non-positive arrival times (ai?0ai?0) indicate the student arrived early or on time; positive arrival times (ai>0ai>0) indicate the student arrived aiai minutes late. Output Format For each test case, print the word YES if the class is canceled or NO if it is not. Constraints 1?T?101?T?10 1?N?10001?N?1000 1?K?N1?K?N ?100?ai?100,where i?[1,N]?100?ai?100,where i?[1,N] Note If a student arrives exactly on time (ai=0)(ai=0), the student is considered to have entered before the class started. Sample Input 2 4 3 -1 -3 4 2 4 2 0 -1 2 1 Sample Output YES NO Explanation For the first test case, K=3K=3. The professor wants at least 33 students in attendance, but only 22 have arrived on time (?3?3 and ?1?1). Thus, the class is canceled. For the second test case, K=2K=2. The professor wants at least 22 students in attendance, and there are 22 who have arrived on time (00 and ?1?1). Thus, the class is not canceled 
Jasmine is a very lazy girl. She always sleeps in Maths class. One day her teacher catches her sleeping and tells her that he would mark her absent for the whole semester. While he pretends to be strict, he is actually very kind-hearted. So he wants to give Jasmine a chance to prove herself. He gives her a problem. If Jasmine can answer it correctly, he will forgive her. Can you help Jasmine find the answer to this problem? The problem: The teacher gives Jasmine a number N and asks her to find out the probability that any proper divisor of N would be an even perfect square. Note: Even perfect square means the number should be even and a perfect square. Input Format The first line of input contains an integer T, the number of test cases. T lines follow, each line containing N, the number that the teacher provides. Output Format For each test case, print in a newline the output in p/q format where p and q are positive coprime integers. If p is 0, you should simply output 0. Constraints 1<=T<=4×10^4 2<=N<=10^6 Sample Input  4 2 8 36 900 Sample Output  0 1/3 1/8 3/26 
A forward shifted alphabet code is a form of coding in which each letter has been shifted for a particular number. For example, if a message has been encrypted by shifting 2, then 'C' will be written in place of 'A' , 'B' in place of 'Z', 'A' in place of 'Y' and so on. Such integers are the keys to decode shifted alphabet codes. Thaton likes sending encoded messages(only alphabets) to Pravakar. So to decode those messages she gave him N alarm clocks, all set at 12 O' clock with batteries removed, placed sequentially in a box. The alarm clocks rings every  { x1,x2,x3,x4,..........,xn }  hours respectively. While sending the message, she tells Pravakar not to consider a continuous sequence of alarm clocks in the set from positions L to R i.e from XL to XR is not under consideration and ask him to insert the batteries in the rest of the alarm clocks (except alarm clocks from L to R) and informs him that the minimum number of hours after which all the clocks under consideration ring simultaneously is the key to her message. Help Pravakar!! Note :  Shifting of character occurs in a circular manner, i.e. if 'y' need to be shifted forward by 2, 	Then y+2='a' i.e in forward shifting, after z we starts with 'a' again, and in backward shifting , after 'a' we again starts with 'z' e.g back shift 'c' by 5 will be : 'x'.   Input   1st Line contains a single integer N denoting numbers of alarm clocks. 2nd line contains N space separated integers { x1,x2,x3,x4,..........,xn } as described in the statement. 3rd line contains a single integer Q denoting the number of Queries. 1st line for each query contains two space separated integers L and R. 2nd line for each query contains the encoded message.   Output For each Query, print the decoded message in a line.  Constraints  1 <=N,Xi,L,R <=20 1 <=Q <=200 1 <= Length of Encoded Message<=256   Sample Input: 3 1 2 3 1 3 3 YgneqogvqVgejnqp Output: WelcometoTechlon  Explanation One of the clock rings every hour while the other rings every 2 hours and since the value of L =3 and R=3, So third clock is not under consideration. So, the 1st and 2nd clock will ring together after two hours. In other words, all the letters in the given string has been shifted forward by 2. So to decode the message, we have to shift each character backward by 2 
 The Wonderking in Wonderland had a great friend called Wondermath a professor in mathematics. The king and the professor shared everything, they were same age, married same day, have same number of children etc. To represent this friendship  professor Wondermath introduced Amicable numbers, a pair who is friends like him and king.  Amicable numbers are a pair of numbers with the following property: the sum of all of the proper divisors of the first number (not including itself) exactly equals the second number while the sum of all of the proper divisors of the second number (not including itself) likewise equals the first number. The set of 220 and 284 was the first known set of amicable numbers. Pythagoras discovered the relationship and coined the term amicable because he considered the numbers to be a symbol of friendship. For example:  For example let's show that  220 & 284 are amicable numbers: First we find the proper divisors of 220:  1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, 110  If you add up all of these numbers you will see that they sum to 284.   Now find the proper divisors of 284:   1, 2, 4, 71, 142  These sum to 220, and therefore 220 & 284 are amicable numbers. To satisfy his friend Wonderking, professor wants to find many Amicable numbers before the tea time tomorrow. You must develop a program that declares a number is amicable or not in order to help professor WonderMath.    Input The first line of the input file contains the number cases (<10) followed by set of numbers ( < 100,000,000) one in each new line which you have to declare amicable or not.  Output If the number is not an amicable number it should print no, if it is an amicable number it should print yes and the amicable number of it.  Example Input: 4 1184 2620 3550 5020   Output: Yes, amicable with 1210 Yes, amicable with 2924 No Yes, amicable with 5564   Explanation Explained in the above section. 
  Wonderland is a big land. WonderKing wanted to divide it in to provinces and rule them because that is easy. But he has a problem with naming the provinces. He wants to name them with mirrored palindromes only.  A regular palindrome is a string of numbers or letters that is the same forward as backward. For example, the string "ABCDEDCBA" is a palindrome because it is the same when the string is read from left to right as when the string is read from right to left.  A mirrored string is a string for which when each of the elements of the string is changed to its reverse (if it has a reverse) and the string is read backwards the result is the same as the original string. For example, the string "3AIAE" is a mirrored string because "A" and "I" are their own reverses, and "3" and "E" are each others' reverses.  A mirrored palindrome is a string that meets the criteria of a regular palindrome and the criteria of a mirrored string. The string "ATOYOTA" is a mirrored palindrome because if the string is read backwards, the string is the same as the original and because if each of the characters is replaced by its reverse and the result is read backwards, the result is the same as the original string. Of course, "A", "T", "O", and "Y" are all their own reverses.  A list of all valid characters and their reverses is as follows.    .Character.  Reverse.  Character.  Reverse. Character.  Reverse.   A A M M Y Y   B  N  Z 5   C  O O 1 1   D  P  2 S   E 3 Q  3 E   F  R  4    G  S 2 5 Z   H H T T 6    I I U U 7    J L V V 8 8   K  W W 9    L J X X      The WonderKing wants you to help him to find palindromes, mirrored strings, mirrored palindromes separately.  Input  First line of input contains the number of strings you should check Each following line contains a string which you should check with your program. Each line will consist of one to fifty valid characters.  There will be no invalid characters in any of the strings.   Output  For each input string, you should print that string and immediately follow it by exactly one of the following strings.   String Criteria   "is not a palindrome." if the string is not a palindrome and is not a mirrored string   "is a regular palindrome." if the string is a palindrome and is not a mirrored string   "is a mirrored string." if the string is not a palindrome and is a mirrored string   "is a mirrored palindrome." if the string is a palindrome and is a mirrored string    Example Input: 4 NOTAPALINDROME ISAPALINILAPASI 2A3MEAS ATOYOTA  Output: NOTAPALINDROME is not a palindrome. ISAPALINILAPASI is a regular palindrome. 2A3MEAS is a mirrored string. ATOYOTA is a mirrored palindrome.  
 WonderKing himself is a very genius in mathematics. One day when he was thinking, king got a wonderful idea – circular prime. A circular prime is a prime number with the property that the number generated at each intermediate step when cyclically permuting its (base 10) digits will be a prime. Simply if all the rotational digits of a number are themselves primes, it is called a circular prime number. Let's see an example where numbers are generated by cyclically permuting the digits of 19937. The first digit is removed and readded at the right side of the remaining string of digits. This process is repeated until the starting number is reached again. Since all intermediate numbers generated by this process are prime, 19937 is a circular prime. 19937 is the first circular prime WonderKing encountered. 199379937193719371997199319937 Later he was managed get the first 10 circular primes, they will be 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 37, 79, 113. You have to help him to find more circular primes.  Input Input description. Tips:  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases, i.e. number of cases you are required to check. T is followed by the numbers you need to check whether they are circular primes or not   Output If a certain number is a circular prime print yes. If not a circular prime print no.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 Each and every test case would be less than 1,000,000   Example Input: 5 3 113 67 9311 19  Output: Yes Yes No Yes No  
While having the dinner WonderKing and professor WonderMath was discussing about Ideal numbers – a great topic in mathematics, WonderQueen who was not that much interested in mathematics , was listening to the discussions and was thinking only a number can be ideal, why not strings?. She asked it from her mother who is a expert in language, she replied Yes and gave an explanation to Ideal String.  Amicable numbers are a pair of numbers with the following property: the sum of all of the proper divisors of the first number (not including itself) exactly equals the second number while the sum of all of the proper divisors of the second number (not including itself) likewise equals the first number. An Ideal string is a string where the index of the first occurrence of each letter is equal to the number of occurrences of that letter in the string. (Assume index starts with 1). For example:  For example the string CIOOIO is an ideal string.  1.The letter C appears only one time and index of the first occurrence of it is 1. : 2.The letter I appear two times and index of the first occurrence of it is 2. : 3.The letter O appears three times and index of the first occurrence of it is 3. :  BEECCCC is also an ideal string.  1.The letter B appears only one time and index of the first occurrence of it is 1. : 2.The letter E appear two times and index of the first occurrence of it is 2. : 3.The letter C appears four times and index of the first occurrence of it is 4. :  WonderQueen got so much interested about Ideal Strings, she wanted to explore more and more Ideal strings, So you must help her..   Input The first line of the input file contains the number cases (<10) followed by set of numbers ( < 100,000,000) one in each new line which you have to declare amicable or not. The first line of the input file contains the number of strings ( < 100) followed by strings in each new line ( length of a string < 20) with only letters od uppercase in English alphabet, that you have to check ideal or not.   Output  If a string is ideal you must print, Yes Else, No   Example Input:  5 BEECCCC CIOOIO FEDEED DIFFFI BUHUHH   Output: Yes Yes No Yes Yes    Explanation Explained in the above section. 
A war between Wonderland and Lierland started. So our leader WonderKing had to go to the war base, but he is going to miss his love WonderQueen. So WonderKing decided to send messages often to WonderQueen,  but did not want any other to read them and understand the  messages, so he used a strange language Pig Latin.  It is not related to pigs or Latin. But it was a safe language. The usual rules for changing standard English into Pig Latin are as follows:  In words that begin with consonant sounds, the initial letter is moved to the end of the word, and "ay" is added, as in the following examples:  happy --> appyhay question --> uestionqay  In words that begin with vowel (a , e , I , o , u) letter the syllable "way" is simply added to the end of the word. another --> anotherway about --> aboutway  As he wants to send messages recently to WonderQueen king wants you to provide a program for him.Your program to this problem is simply a English to Pig Latin converter adhering to above rules.  Input The first line of the input file contains the number of cases ( < 10) and followed by English. In the sentences first letter will be capital ( A – Z) and the rest of the characters are letters ( a – z) and spaces followed by a full stop.   Output  The appropriate Pig Latin translated sentences, the sentence should begin with a capital letter and end with the full stop.   Example Input: 6 I love you. We won the war. Tea is ready. He came here. There is a huge traffic. I was there.    Output: Iway ovelay ouyay. Eway onway ethay arway. Eatay isway eadyray. Ehay amecay erehay. Heretay isway away ugehay raffictay. Iway asway heretay.     Explanation Explained in the above section. 
This time it was WonderKing’s opportunity to challenge WonderMath, although it is hard to give him a challenge, king gave a challenge. It is like follows. King gives a number that is sum of most 10 consecutive numbers and least 2 consecutive numbers. WonderMath has to find those consecutive numbers which has to add. As an Example : We can write 18 as the sum of consecutive as follow, 18 = 5 + 6 + 7 18 = 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 In this challenge you have to consider most consecutive numbers, so the answer will be 3,4,5,6. Your program must help WonderMath to find those consecutives.  Input The first line contains the number of cases (< 100), and then in each new line the number ( < 10,000)you have to find consecutives.   Output  The consecutive numbers that sums up to produce the number given in the input file, each number separated by a space.   Example Sample Input: 4 12 18 40 171   Sample Output: 3 4 5 3 4 5 6 6 7 8 9 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18    Explanation Explained in the above section. 
 You receive a credit C at a local store and would like to buy two items. You first walk through the store and create a list L of all available items. From this list you would like to buy two items that add up to the entire value of the credit.

Aliens are planning to attack on Earth. Scientists at ISRO got a breakthrough when they were able to intercept the message being transferred in between aliens, but the problem is that aliens are using a technique for encrypting the message. Codefest team of IT-BHU were able to hack into the systems of aliens and decipher the method, the aliens were using for encryption but a method for decryption has not been found yet. You are required to decrypt the message. The method used for encryption is explained below: Consider a string of N alphabets for example encrypt (N=7). The string is treated as if the last character wraps around back to the first. Next consider a set S of N different strings, in which each string is formed by cyclic rotation of the alphabets of the original string. So for the string encrypt, S = {encrypt, ncrypte, crypten, ryptenc, yptencr, ptencry, tencryp} The next step is to perform a lexicographical sort in decreasing order on the set of above strings. So S becomes {yptencr, tencryp, ryptenc, ptencry, ncrypte, encrypt, crypten} Now, the encyrpted string of N alphabets is formed taking the last character from the above sorted strings. For given example, the encrypted string is rpcyetn. They also send the position of the first character of the encrypted string so that the message can be decrypted i.e. 5 for the given example.  Input There is a single integer T<=200 on the first line of input which denotes the number of test cases to follow. Each of the next T lines, contains a string made up of k alphabets (a-z characters only) followed by an integer N, separated by a blankspace. 1<=N<=k<=3000.  Output Output consists of T lines, each containing the decrypted string.  Example  Input: 3 rpcyetn 5 rathe 5 aabb 2 Output: encrypt earth abab 
Run-length encoding(RLE) is a very simple and easy form of data compression in which consecutive occurrences of the same characters are replaced by a single character followed by its frequency. As an example, the string S  aabbbbdaa would be encoded to a2b4d1a2. Thus encoded string is described as an ordered sequence of pairs (a, i), each consisting of an alphabet symbol a and an integer i. Each pair corresponds to a run in S consisting of i consecutive occurrences of a. In this problem, we are interested in finding the minimum number of mutation(s) needed to transform first string given in encoded form into second string i.e. edit distance when only two operation are allowed  Add any character at any position(insertion) Remove any character from any position(deletion)  The cost of inserting a character is 1 and cost of deleting a character is 2.  Input The input file contains several test cases. The first line of the input denotes the number of test cases, T (1≤T≤100) to follow. Each test case begins on a new line and consists of an integer L1, a blankspace and a run length encoded string S1 and then on a new line, an integer L2, a blankspace and a run length encoded string S2. L1 and L2 denote the number of runs in strings S1 and S2 respectively. 1<=L1,L2<=100. S1 and S2 consists of alphabets [a-z] followed by number of consecutive occurrences of  that character. You can safely assume that the total length of any of the strings will not exceed 3000 characters.  Output For each test case, output the edit distance from S1 to S2 in a new line.   Example  Input: 2 2 a3b2 1 b3 3 a1b1a1 1 a2 Output: 7 2

 The Head Chef is receiving a lot of orders for cooking the best of the problems lately. For this, he organized an hiring event to hire some talented Chefs. He gave the following problem to test the skills of the participating Chefs. Can you solve this problem and be eligible for getting hired by Head Chef.   A non-negative number n is said to be magical if it satisfies the following property. Let S denote the multi-set of numbers corresponding to the non-empty subsequences of the digits of the number n in decimal representation. Please note that the numbers in the set S can have leading zeros. Let us take an element s of the multi-set S, prod(s) denotes the product of all the digits of number s in decimal representation. The number n will be called magical if sum of prod(s) for all elements s in S, is even.  For example, consider a number 246, its all possible non-empty subsequence will be S = {2, 4, 6, 24, 46, 26, 246}. Products of digits of these subsequences will be {prod(2) = 2, prod(4) = 4, prod(6) = 6, prod(24) = 8, prod(46) = 24, prod(26) = 12, prod(246) = 48, i.e. {2, 4, 6, 8, 24, 12, 48}. Sum of all of these is 104, which is even. Hence 246 is a magical number.  Please note that multi-set S can contain repeated elements, e.g. if number is 55, then S = {5, 5, 55}. Products of digits of these subsequences will be {prod(5) = 5, prod(5) = 5, prod(55) = 25}, i.e. {5, 5, 25}. Sum of all of these is 35 which is odd. Hence 55 is not a magical number.  Consider a number 204, then S = {2, 0, 4, 20, 04, 24, 204}. Products of digits of these subsequences will be {2, 0, 4, 0, 0, 8, 0}. Sum of all these elements will be 14 which is even. So 204 is a magical number.   The task was to simply find the K^th magical number.   Input  First line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each of the next T lines contains a single integer K.   Output For each test case, print a single integer corresponding to the K^th magical number.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^12.   Example Input: 2 2 5  Output: 2 8  Explanation Example case 1. 2 is the 2^nd magical number, since it satisfies the property of the magical number. The first magical number will be of course 0.  
Chef has an array A consisting of N integers. He also has an intger K. Chef wants you to find out number of different arrays he can obtain from array A by applying the following operation exactly K times.  Pick some element in the array and multiply it by -1   As answer could be quite large, print it modulo 10^9 + 7.   Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers N, K as defined above. The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the elements of the array.   Output  For each test case, output a single line containing an integer corresponding to the number of different arrays Chef can get modulo 10^9 + 7.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ N, K ≤ 10^5 -10^6 ≤ Ai ≤ 10^6   Example Input: 3 1 3 100 3 1 1 2 1 3 2 1 2 1  Output: 1 3 4  Explanation Example case 1. Chef has only one element and must apply the operation 3 times to it. After applying the operations, he will end up with -100. That is the only array he will get.  Example case 2. Chef can apply operation to one of three elements. So, he can obtain three different arrays.  Example case 3. Note that other than applying operation to positions (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), Chef can also apply the operation twice on some element and get the original.  In summary, Chef can get following four arrays.  [1, 2, 1] [-1, -2, 1] [-1, 2, -1] [1, -2, -1]

Chef has recently noticed that demand for brownie is increasing rapidly. So, he decided to install N machines to cater to the increasing demand. All machines are numbered from 1 to N. To use the machines, Chef has to enter two numbers l and r, such that all the machines numbered from l to r inclusive produce a single brownie. Now, you are given N numbers where the i^th number denotes the number of brownies produced by i^th machine till now. After that, there will be M queries where each query contains two numbers l and r. Now, our Chef wants to know how many brownies have been produced till now by each machine after M queries.  Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two space separated integer N and M.The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the number of brownies produced by each machine before queries.Then M lines follow where each line contains two space separated integer l and r".   Output  For each test case, output a single line containing N space separated integers denoting the numbers of brownies produced by each machine after all the M queries.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 30 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ M ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ Ai ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ N   Example Input: 1 8 4 2 3 4 6 9 1 7 8 2 4 3 7 1 5 7 8  Output: 3 5 7 9 11 2 9 9    Explanation There is only one test case. After the first query, the number of brownies will be 2 4 5 7 9 1 7 8. After the second query, the number of brownies will be 2 4 6 8 10 2 8 8. After the third query, the number of brownies will be 3 5 7 9 11 2 8 8. After the fourth query, the final number of brownies will be 3 5 7 9 11 2 9 9 
 Chef once wanted to count the number of vertex disjoint cycle covers of a directed graph. A cycle cover is a set of cycles covering the set of vertices (A set of cycles S is said to be covering set of vertices if each vertex lies in at least one of the cycles in S). A vertex disjoint cycle cover is a cycle cover in which no two cycles have any common vertex. A cycle is a sequence of t > 1 distinct vertices a1, a2, ..., at such that there is an edge from ai to ai+1 for 1 <= i < t and an edge from at to a1.  Chef has a directed graph G containing n vertices and m edges. You have to help the chef in finding out the number of vertex disjoint cycle covers in it. As the answer could be very large, please print it modulo 10^9 + 7.   Input  First line of the input contains a single integer T denoting number of test cases. Description of T test cases follows. First line of each test case will contain two integers: n, m denoting number of vertices and number of edges in the graph G. For next m lines, each line will contain two space separated integers: u, v denoting that there is an edge from u to v in the graph.   Output  For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting the answer to the problem.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 5 1 ≤ n ≤ 20 0 ≤ m ≤ n × (n - 1) 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n u != v It is guaranteed that no edge repeats in the input. So all ordered (u, v) pairs (represending edges in the graph) appearing in the input will be distinct.   Example Input: 4 3 3 1 2 2 3 3 1 4 4 1 2 2 1 3 4 4 3 2 1 1 2 4 8 1 2 2 1 2 4 4 2 1 3 3 1 3 4 4 3  Output: 1 1 0 4  Explanation Example case 1. There is exactly one vertex disjoint cycle cover. ie. (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1) Example case 2. There is exactly one vertex disjoint cycle cover in this graph too. Collection of cycles in that cycle cover will be (1 -> 2 -> 1) and (3 -> 4 -> 3) Example case 3. There is no vertex disjoint cycle cover in this case, as (1 -> 2) is not a cycle. 
 There are n trees on a road in Chef's garden. Each tree has one of the three colours out of red, green or blue. You are given information about the colours of the trees by a string s. if s[i] is 'R', it means that i^th tree is red. Similarly 'G' denotes green and 'B' denotes blue colored tree.  Chef likes to create a beautiful pattern out of the tree colours. A pattern is called beautiful if all the trees of the same colour are continuous. eg. "RRBGG" and "GGBBB" are beautiful patterns, but "RGRB" is not a beautiful pattern because trees of red color are not continuous.   For achieving beautiful pattern, chef is permitted to change the colours of the trees. For changing the colour of i^th tree from any colour to any other colour, he needs to pay a cost of c[i] rupees. Find out the minimum amount of rupees the chef requires, to create a beautiful pattern out of the colours of the n trees.   Input  First line of the input contains a single integer T denoting number of test cases. Description of T test cases follows. First line of each test case will contain a single integer n denoting number of trees on the road in chef's garden. Second line will contain a single line containing string s as defined in the problem. Third line will contain n space separated integers denoting the array c, i.e. c[1], c[2], .., c[n].   Output  For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting minimum amount of rupees needed to create a beautiful pattern.   Constraints  1 ≤ T, n ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ c[i] ≤ 10^9  Sum of n over all the test cases won't exceed 10^6   Example Input: 3 3 RGB 1 2 3 3 RRR 1 2 3 3 RBR 1 2 3  Output: 0 0 1  Explanation Example case 1. Pattern is already beautiful. There is no need to pay any cost. Example case 2. Pattern is already beautiful. There is no need to pay any cost. Example case 3. Change colour of the first tree to blue. Then the pattern will BBR, which is beautiful pattern. Cost required will be 1. There is no way to create a beautiful pattern by paying less than 1 rupee. Hence answer is 1. 
  Problem description. All the chefs live in the town of Chefpur.Chefpur consist of various localities with each locality having  some number of houses in which the chefs and their families live.Each locality in Chefpur is represented by a decimal number.Number of houses in each locality is given by the number of bits in the binary representation of that locality number.All the chef families are either good neighbours or bad neighbours.If in the binary representation of locality number, a bit is '1' then the corresponding family is a good neighbour and if the bit is '0' then the family is a bad neighbour.For example if a locality number is 5 then it can be represented in binary as 101.Thus the number of houses are 3(no of bits).Number of good neighbours are 2(as 2 bits are equal to '1') and the number of bad neighbours are 1(as only 1 bit is equal to '0').  Chefs in the chefpur wants to have increase harmony among themselves.Harmony is defined by the number of good neighbours which are present together  i.e the number consequtives '1' bits.  You are given two numbers l and r.All the localities in Chefpur are between l and r.Your task is to find an arrangement of localities so that the harmony is maximum in Chefpur.For eg if l=2,r=4 then the possible arrangements of localities are 234,243,324,343,432,423.  Help the chefs to find the value of maximium harmony that can exist in Chefpur.    Input The first line contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases to follow.  Each of the test cases have exactly two space separated integers,  l and r representing the starting and ending values for localities in Chefpur.  Output  Output exactly T lines i.e 1 line per test case representing the max harmony.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^5   Example Input: 1 1 4  Output: 4    Explanation 1 can be represented as 1 2 can be represented as 10 3 can be represented as 11 4 can be represented as 100 Arrangement 1 2 3 4- 11011100(harmony is equal to 3) Arrangement 1 3 2 4- 11110100(harmony is equal to 4) Arrangement 1 2 4 3- 11010011(harmony is equal to 2) Arrangement 1 3 4 2- 11110010(harmony is equal to 4) etc. Max harmony obtained is 4. ... 
 Problem Statement Chef is at a mountain range . There are N mountains lined up in a straight line . Each mountain has a height h[i] . Chef is currently at mountain a and wants to go to mountain b . He can do so by jumping from mountain a to b (he is talented ) . But he can jump from a to b only if there is no mountain between a and b whose height is strictly greater than that of mountain a . In this problem , you will be given the array h containing heights of mountains and several queries with a and b , you will have you answer whether chef can jump from a to b or not .   Input The first line contains an integer N, the next line has N integers denoting the heights of the mountains h[i] . The next line has an integer Q , the number of queries , Then q lines follow each containing 2 integers a and b.  Output For each query , answer "YES" if chef can jump from a to b , otherwise answer "NO" if he cant .   Constraints  1 <= N <= 10^5 1 <= h[i] <= 10^4 1 <= Q <= 10^5 1 <= a <= N 1 <= b <= N b>a   Example Input: 5 2 3 1 2 4 3 1 3 2 5 2 3 Output: NO YES YES   Explaination For first query the answer is NO because between 1 and 3 , the second mountain is of height 3 which is more than height of mountain 1 which is 2 . For second query there is no mountain more than 3 units high between 2 and 5 so answer is YES. For 3rd query there is no mountain between 2 and 3 so the answer is YES . 
 Chef goes to the market to buy a laptop. He enters a shop which has n laptops on display. Cost of i^th laptop is c[i].   Chef wants to buy a single laptop by paying least amount of money. But there is an issue: when there are two or more laptops available at the same cost, he gets confused about which one he should buy, so in turn, he can't buy any of those.   Find the minimum amount of money he needs to pay to buy a single laptop. It is guaranteed that there is always a way to buy a laptop.   Input  First line of the input contains contains a single integer T denoting number of test cases. For each test case there will be two lines. First line of each test case will contain a single integer n denoting number of laptops available. Second line of each test case will contain n space separated integers denoting array c i.e. c[1], c[2], .., c[n] as defined in the problem.   Output  For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting minimum amount of money needed for Chef to buy a laptop.   Constraints  1 ≤ T, n ≤ 100 1 ≤ c[i] ≤ 100   Example Input: 3 2 1 2 3 1 1 2 6 3 5 4 4 3 3 Output: 1 2 5  Explanation Example case 1. He can buy the cheapest laptop i.e. cost = 1. Example case 2. He can't buy any laptop with cost 1 because there are more than 1 (i.e. 2) such laptops and Chef will be confused in choosing. So he will choose the unique laptop with cost = 2. Example case 3. He can't buy any of the laptops with cost 3 because there are more than 1 (i.e. 3) such laptops and Chef will be confused in choosing. Similarly, he also can't buy laptops with cost 4. So he will choose the unique laptop with cost = 5. 
Every great chef knows that lucky numbers are positive integers whose decimal representations contain only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not. Our chef has recently returned from the Lucky country. He observed that every restaurant in the Lucky country had a lucky number as its name. He believes that having a lucky number as a restaurant name can indeed turn out to be very lucky. Our chef believes that it is possible to make a lucky number having N digits even luckier. Any number following the rules below is called Lucky lucky number -  1. The number contains only digits 4 and 7.  2. Count of digit 4 in the number should be divisible by 7.  3. Count of digit 7 in the number should be divisible by 4. Help our chef to compute the count of digit 4 in the smallest Lucky lucky number having N digits.  Input  First line contains T, number of test cases. Each of the next T lines contains a number N, the number of digits in the Lucky lucky number to be formed. 1<=T<=1000 1<=N<=1000000000 (10^9)  Output  If it is not possible to form a Lucky lucky number having N digits, output -1. Otherwise, output the count of digit 4 in the smallest Lucky lucky number having N digits.  Example  Input: 5 7 4 11 1 15  Output: 7 0 7 -1 7  Explanation For the last test case, N = 15, the smallest lucky lucky number is 444444477777777. The count of digit 4 is 7.  
 Problem Statement  Chef just went to moon , that too without any spacesuit ( chef is really talented ) , but when he reached moon , he discovered aliens living  there . Now chef is at a city 'U' on moon and wants to travel to city 'V' , but the cars which aliens use can travel only K units distance in a day.  In this problem you are given the layout of moon and K . Chef will travel from U to V only if the shortest path from U to V is atmost K units . Given a few queries of U and V , answer whether chef can travel from U to V in a day or not .   Input The first line contains 3 integers integer N and M and K denoting the number of cities , number of roads and The distance the car can travel in a day. The next m lines contain 3 integers A ,B , C denoting there is a bidirectional road from A to B of distance C. The Next line contains the number of queries Q . Then Q lines follow each containing 2 integers U and V .  Output For each query , if the shortest path from U to V is less than or equal to K then output "YES" , otherwise "NO" in a separate line . If its not possible to visit city V from U , then also print "NO" only .   Constraints  1<=n<=100 1<=m<=200 1<=k<=1000 1<=a<=n 1<=b<=n 1<=c<=100 1<=q<=100 1<=u<=n 1<=v<=n   Example Input: 4 4 2 1 2 1 1 3 4 2 3 1 3 4 1 3 1 2 1 3 1 4 Output: YES YES NO    Explaination  For 1st query , distance from 1 to 2 is 1 which is less then 2 so the answer is YES , for query 2 , shortest distance from 1 to 3 is 2 because chef can go from 1 to 2 (distance 1 ) and then from 2 to 3 (distance 1) , so total distance from 1 to 3 is 2 so the answer is YES . For 3rd query , the distance from 1 to 4 can not be less than 3 . so the answer is NO.

Tic-Tac-Toe used to be Chef's favourite game during his childhood. Reminiscing in his childhood memories, he decided to create his own "Tic-Tac-Toe", with rules being similar to the original Tic-Tac-Toe, other than the fact that it is played on an NxN board.   The game is played between two players taking turns. First player puts an 'X' in an empty cell of the board, then the second player puts an 'O' in some other free cell. If the first player has K continuous X's or the second player has K continuous O's in row, column or diagonal, then he wins.   Chef started playing this new "Tic-Tac-Toe" with his assistant, beginning as the first player himself (that is, Chef plays 'X's). Currently, the game is ongoign, and it's Chef's turn. However, he needs to leave soon to begin tonight's dinner preparations, and has time to play only one more move. If he can win in one move, output "YES", otherwise output "NO" (without quotes). It is guaranteed that no player has already completed the winning criterion before this turn, and that it's a valid "Tic-Tac-Toe" game.  Input The first line of input contains one integer T denoting the number of testcases. First line of each testcase contains two integers N and K, next N lines contains N characters each. Each character is either an 'X' denoting that the first player used this cell, an 'O' meaning that the second player used this cell, or a '.' (a period) representing a free cell.   Output For each testcase, output, in a single line, "YES" if Chef can win in one move, or "NO" otherwise.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 3 ≤ N ≤ 20 1 ≤ K ≤ N   Example Input: 3 3 3 XOX O.O XOX 3 1 ... ... ... 3 2 ... ... ...   Output: YES YES NO  Input: 1 4 4 XOXO OX.. XO.. OXOX  Output: YES   Subtasks  Subtask 1:  K  = 1. Points - 10 Subtask 2:  N  =  K  = 3. Points - 30 Subtask 3: Original constraints. Points - 60   Explanation  Test #1: In first testcase, put 'X' in (2, 2), in second we can put 'X' in any cell and win. Test #2: If you put an 'X' in (3, 3), there will be four 'X's on the main diagonal (1, 1) - (2, 2) - (3, 3) - (4, 4).  
The chef is fond of triangles. He has a task for you. You are given n point out of which only k are collinear. Find the number of triangles that can be formed from these n points. You have to perform the above task for a number of test cases.    Input The first line of input contains the number of test cases, t. Then t lines follow each containing 2 space separated integers n and k.  Output The output contains t lines each containing the answer for that particular test case. Each line contains the number triangles that can be formed for that particular test.  Constraints 1<=t<=1000 3<=n<=1000000 3<=k<=n  Example Input: 1 30 5 Output: 4050 
The chef has a book stand. He and his friend bought some books (say n). The book stand has only 2 empty shelves. The chef made an observation that the paper quality, the weight of a single paper and the dimensions of all the books are the same. The chef made a restriction, to the books that can be kept on the shelves. He said only m (an integer) books can be placed on the top shelf and rest of the books are to be placed on the bottom shelf. There is one more condition that has to be satisfied, that is, the difference between the sum of the weight of the books on the top shelf and the sum of weight of the books on the bottom shelf should be the most among all such arrangements possible. Your task is to calculate this maximum difference for a number of test cases.   Input 1.	The first line of input contains the number of test cases, t. 2.

The Chef and his brother own a rectangular field.  Chef’s brother wants to sell the field. He calls the Chef one day and says that if any dimension of the field is a prime number, he will sell the field. He tells him that he will measure the exact dimensions the next morning. The Chef does not want to sell the field. He knows that his brother is adamant and there is no way that he will change his mind.  So, he comes up with a plan to save some part of the field. He decides to measure the dimensions of the field in the night. If any dimension was a prime number he would reduce that dimension to the closest non prime number. Now, when the brother will measure the field in the morning, he cannot sell it. Print the area of the reduced field. You need to perform the above task for a number of test cases. NOTE: If the dimension cannot be reduced to non prime number, then reduce it to 1.   Input The first line of input contains the number of test cases, t. Then t lines follow, each containing 2 positive integers, L and B, the dimensions of the field.  Output The output contains t lines, each for each test case. For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the resultant field.  Constraints 1<=t<=10000 1<= L,B <=1000000  Example Input: 4 4 10 2 2 13 14 16 18 Output: 40 1 168 288

After this replace the character with the maximum frequency with '?' (without quotes). Then, print the resulting string. You have to do this for a number of test cases.   Input The first line of input contains the number of test cases. Then t lines follow, each containing a string s of lower case characters.  Output The output contains t lines, one for each test case, each containing the resultant string for that test case.  Constraints 1<=t<=100 1<=|S|<=1000, |S| is the length of the string S.  Example Input: 1 aba Output: ?b? 
 Problem description.  time given to them. The faculty has thus decided to encode the questions, which the students will then have to decode. They have decided to enlist your help in this - don’t get too happy, you won’t be told the questions which will be coming in your exam. Given the question and an integer N, you are supposed to find the encoded question, such that each letter of the alphabet in the question will be offset by that integer N. For example if the integer is 2, a will become c. If the offset goes beyond z, start again from a, so y will become a. You have to preserve the case of each letter, and leave all other characters unchanged.    Input The first line of input contains an integer T, the number of test cases. The first line of each test case will consist of an integer N, the offset integer. The next line will have the question string, consisting of English alphabets, the question mark character ‘?’, and the comma character ‘,’ and the space character.  Output For each test case, output the encoded question on a line by itself.   Constraints  1 <= T <= 100 1 <= length of questing string <= 10^5 1 <= N <= 10^6    Example Input: 1 1 What is your name?   Output: Xibu jt zpvs obnf?    .ques{ text-align:justify;}

Gru has not been in the limelight for a long time and is, therefore, planning something particularly nefarious. Frustrated by his minions' incapability which has kept him away from the limelight, he has built a transmogrifier — a machine which mutates minions.   Each minion has an intrinsic characteristic value (similar to our DNA), which is an integer. The transmogrifier adds an integer K to each of the minions' characteristic value.   Gru knows that if the new characteristic value of a minion is divisible by 7, then it will have Wolverine-like mutations.   Given the initial characteristic integers of N minions, all of which are then transmogrified, find out how many of them become Wolverine-like.   Input Format: The first line contains one integer, T, which is the number of test cases. Each test case is then described in two lines. The first line contains two integers N and K, as described in the statement. The next line contains N integers, which denote the initial characteristic values for the minions.  Output Format: For each testcase, output one integer in a new line, which is the number of Wolverine-like minions after the transmogrification.  Constraints:  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ N ≤ 100 1 ≤ K ≤ 100 All initial characteristic values lie between 1 and 10^5, both inclusive.   Example  Input: 1 5 10 2 4 1 35 1  Output: 1  Explanation: After transmogrification, the characteristic values become {12,14,11,45,11}, out of which only 14 is divisible by 7. So only the second minion becomes Wolverine-like. 
 Petr is organizing Petr Mitrichev Contest #11. The top N coders according to codechef ratings (excluding Petr himself) agreed to participate in the contest. The participants have been ranked from 0 to N-1 according to their ratings. Petr had asked each participant to choose a coder with rating higher than himself/ herself, whom he/she would like to be team-mates with, and the i^th ranked coder's choice is stored as choice[i]. As expected, programmers turned out to be lazy, and only a few of them actually filled in their choices. If choice[i] = -1, then it means the i^th coder was lazy and did not fill his/her choice. Of course, the top-ranked person (i.e., rank = 0),  Gennady Korotkevich  (obviously), despite clearly not being a lazy person, was not able to fill any choice, because he is the top ranked coder, so choice[0] is always equal to -1.   Petr, being the organizer, had to undertake the arduous task of filling in the choices for the lazy participants. Unfortunately, he also got lazy and adopted the following random strategy:   For each lazy person i (i.e., for all i > 0, such that choice[i] = -1), he flips an unbiased coin (i.e. with 1/2 probability it lands Heads, and with 1/2 probability it lands Tails). Notice that no coin is flipped for i If it lands Heads, he will not change the choice of this person. That is, he leaves choice[i] as -1.   Otherwise, if it lands Tails, he will uniformly at random select one of the top i ranked participants as choice of i^th person. That is, he sets choice[i] = j, where j is randomly and uniformly chosen from 0 to i-1, inclusive.   After this process of filling the choice array, Petr is wondering about the maximum number of teams he can have such that all the valid choices are respected (i.e. if choice[i] = j and j != -1, then i and j should be in the same team). Petr now has to arrange for computers. As each team will need a computer, he wants to know the expected value of maximum number of teams. As he is too busy in organizing this contest, can you please help him?   Input: The first line of input contains T, the number of test cases. Each test case contains 2 lines. The first line contains a single integer N. The second line contains N integers, which specify the choice array: choice[0], choice[1],..,choice[N-1].  Output: Each test case's output must be in a new line and must be 1 number which is the expected number of teams. Your answer should be within an absolute error of 10^-6 from the correct answer.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000 The sum of all the T Ns in one test file ≤ 5000 -1 ≤ choice[i] ≤ i-1 , for all 0 ≤ i < N choice[0] will be equal to -1, always   Example Input: 1 5 -1 -1 1 2 1  Output: 1.5  Explanation: choice[2] = 1 implies 1 and 2 should be in the same team. choice[3] = 2 implies that 2 and 3 have to be in the same team. Therefore, 1, 2 and 3 have to be in the same team. Also, choice[4] = 1 implies that 1 and 4 have to be in the same team, which means that 1, 2, 3 and 4 — all have to be in the same team. The only lazy person is 1. So with probability 1/2, Petr leaves his choice unchanged, or with the remaining 1/2 probability, he assigns choice[1] = 0, as 0 is the only higher ranked person for 1. In the first case, you can get 2 teams: {0} and {1, 2, 3 ,4}. In the second case, because choice[1] = 0, 0 and 1 are forced to be in the same team, and hence {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} is the only possible team. Therefore, with 1/2 probability, number of teams = 1 and with another 1/2 probability, it is 2. Hence, expected number of teams = (1/2 * 1) + (1/2 * 2) = 1.5. 
Jimma the cat had placed N bowls of cat food in a line. The amount of food in each bowl is an integer and is given to you as the array A[1], A[2], ... , A[N], where A[1] is the amount of food in the leftmost bowl, and A[N] is the amount in the rightmost bowl.   But Chingam the kitten doesn't like unsorted sequences. In general, for an arbitrary sequence B[1], B[2], ... , B[N], Chingam's unhappiness is defined as the number of inversions in that sequence. That is, unhappiness = number of pairs (i,j), such that i < j and B[i] > B[j].   Now, Chingam wants to take the bowls from the old line and create a new line with them, possibly re-ordered, so that his unhappiness is minimized. ie. let's say that after re-ordering, the bowls form the sequence P[1], P[2], ... , P[N]. That is, P[1] is the amount of food in the leftmost bowl of the new line and P[N] is the amount of food in the rightmost bowl of the new line. Then he wants to minimize his unhappiness with respect to this array P. Note that P[1], P[2], ... , P[N] will be a permutation of A[1], A[2], ... , A[N].   But he follows a peculiar method to build the new line (which is initially empty) from the old line of bowls. He takes one bowl at a time from the old line and places it in the new line. Due to the limitations of his paws, Chingam can only pick a bowl which is the current leftmost or rightmost in the old line for each step. And he can place it only at the current right or left end of the new line.  By doing this, Chingam gets a new sequence P[1], P[2], ... , P[N]. He wants to minimize his unhappiness with respect to this new sequence.   Find out the minimum unhappiness that Chingam has to bear.   Input Format: The first line contains one integer, T, the number of test cases. For each test case: The first line contains a single integer, N. The next line contains N integers: A[1], A[2], ... , A[N].  Output Format: Output one integer in a new line for each testcase: the minimum unhappiness achievable.  Constraints:  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ N ≤ 100 0 ≤ A[i] ≤ 1000, for all i in 1 to N.   Example:  Input: 1 6 5 3 4 3 2 7  Output: 1  Explanation: We show a sequence of moves which gives unhappiness = 1:  Old Line = 5 3 4 3 2 7 New Line = Empty  Old Line = 3 4 3 2 7 New Line = 5  Old Line = 3 4 3 2 New Line = 5 7  Old Line = 4 3 2 New Line = 3 5 7  Old Line = 3 2 New Line = 4 3 5 7  Old Line = 2 New Line = 3 4 3 5 7  Old Line = Empty New Line = 2 3 4 3 5 7 Now, in this new line, i = 3 and j = 4 is the only pair which satisfies i < j and P[i] > P[j]. Therefore, the unhappiness of this sequence is 1. You can verify that this is the minimum possible.  
You are given N lines (which extend indefinitely in both directions) on the X-Y plane. Some of these lines intersect with each other and others don't (parallel lines). We call each such intersection, an intersection point. You have to find the K^th intersection from the bottom.   In particular, you have to output the smallest value V, such that there are at least K intersection points whose Y-coordinate is ≤ V.   If m lines intersect at a particular point, that point is counted m(m-1)/2 times. That is, if only two lines intersect at a point, it is counted as one intersection point. But if three lines intersect at the same point, it is counted as 3 intersection points: one for each pair.   You are guaranteed that all the N lines are distinct, and that there are at least K intersection points between the lines.   Input Format:  The first line contains the two integers N and K.   The next N lines contain two space separated integers each. The (i+1)^th line contains Mi and Ci, such that the equation y = Mi*x + Ci, denotes the i^th line.   Output Format:  Output one value denoting V as defined in the problem, which should be within 10^-2 of the correct answer.   Constraints:  1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 K  ≥ 1 It is guaranteed that there are at least K intersection points. That is, 1 ≤ K ≤ number of intersection points in the input data -20000 ≤ Mi ≤ 20000 and Mi ≠ 0 -20000 ≤ Ci ≤ 20000 It is guaranteed that there are no i and j, such that i ≠ j and (Mi = Mj) and (Ci = Cj)   Example:  Input 1: 4 6 -1 2 -3 -1 3 1 -4 1  Output 1: 3.5  Explanation: There are 6 intersection points in total. Therefore, we want the y-coordinate of the highest intersection point. We see that the highest intersection point is (-1.5,3.5), and hence the answer is 3.5.   Input 2: 4 3 -10 -6 -5 -10 2 1 4 -8  Output 2: -7.429 
 You are in a magically discrete 2D world: an H * W grid containing H rows and W columns of cells.  There are rocks at various positions (x, y), none of which can be at (1, 1) at the beginning, but there may be rocks in any other cell of the grid.   (1, 1) refers to the bottom-left cell, and (W, H) refers to the top-right cell.   The most interesting fact in this magic 2D world is that the rocks are falling down without any acceleration! More specifically, a rock which is at (x, y) at time t will be at (x, y - 1) at time t+1 and it will disappear once y becomes 0.   At time t = 0, you are at the bottom-left cell of the grid denoted as (1, 1). (Note that this means that there is no rock at the starting point (1, 1) at the beginning.) You need to move left or right or stay at the same position in order to avoid being hit by a rock. That is, if you are at (x, 1) at time t, you could be at any of the cells (x - 1, 1), (x, 1), or (x + 1, 1) at time t + 1,  assuming that cell exists.   Along with space, time is also discrete in this magic world. In other words, this world is quantum physics gone berserk! At every second, you make your move, and then the rocks fall 1 cell down. So you should make sure that when you move to a cell at time (t + 1), there is no rock in that cell at time t as well as (t + 1).   We are interested in computing how many different layouts of rocks you can survive if you always play in the optimal way after the layout is made available to you. The answer might be very large, so you only need to output answer modulo M.   Input The first line contains an integer T denoting the total number of test cases. For each test case, there are three single-space separated positive integers W, H, and M, in a single line.  Output For each test case, output a line with the answer.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ W ≤ 7 1 ≤ H ≤ 100 1 ≤ M ≤ 10^9 + 7   Example  Input: 2 2 2 100 2 3 100  Output: 5 12   Explanation When W=2, H=3, we can discuss the problem in three cases as following, where Y stands for you, E stands for an empty cell, R stands for a rock, and ? stands for either E or R.  (1) 8 layouts in total.  E? E? Y?  In this case, you just stay at (1, 1) throughout.  (2) 2 layouts in total.  ? E RE YE  In this case, you move to (1, 2) at the very beginning, and stay there.  (3) 2 layouts in total.  RE EE Y?  In this case, you stay at (1, 1) for one second, and then move to (2, 1). So, we have a total of 12 layouts which we can survive.

 Uncle Ben is a very kind man and is revered by the whole neighborhood. One halloween night a group of trick-or-treaters come by Ben's house. Uncle Ben has some treats with him but he sees that the children do not have equal number of treats. He feels that it would be unfair to give away the treats to just any of the kids. So he decides to line up all the kids and distribute the treats according to the number of treats that the respective child has, so that he may equalize the number of treats to the best extent. What is the maximum number of children that have equal number of treats. It is not necessary that Uncle Ben give all his treats.  Input  First line has two integers N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100000), number of children and K  (1 ≤ N ≤ 10^7), number of treats Uncle Ben has. The second line contains N integers sepearated by single space, c1, c2, .... ,cn (1 ≤ ci ≤ 10^6)  where ci is the number of treats i^th children has.  Output  Output  maximum number of children that have equal number of treats.  Example  Input: 4 5 5 5 3 1  Output: 3  Explanation: Uncle Ben gives two treats to 3rd child. So 3 children have five treats each. There is no way that more than 3 children can have equal treats.

Chimp has bought N blocks each with a specific height(h1,h2,h3,….hn) for workout. Let x1,x2,…….xn be an ordering of blocks where xi represents the height of blocks . A workout is consists of N jumps, the first jump is from ground to x1, then from x1 to x2, x2 to x3 and so on till we reach xn. Difficulty of workout is defined as sum of heights of all jumps. Height of a jump is defined as |xi – xi-1| when you jump from xi-1to xi. More specifically, difficulty of a workout is defined as  summation of   |xi – xi-1| for all i (1 <= i <= N) . Since chimp starts from ground, x0 = 0 Now he is interested in finding the maximum and minimum difficulty of workout he can achieve by reordering the blocks. Help Chimp find this answer.   Input  The first line consists of an integer T indicating no. of test cases. T test cases follow. For each test case, First line contains an integer N, the no. of blocks. Next line contains N numbers indicating height hi of each block.  Output  Output 2 space separated numbers, the maximum and minimum difficulty that can be obtained.

Pakistan Team is obsessed with match fixing. Their bookie Asif is writing a letter to them and wants nobody else to be able to read it. They use a simple substitution cipher to encode his message. Each letter in the message is replaced with its corresponding letter in a substitution alphabet. A substitution alphabet is a permutation of all the letters in the original alphabet. In this problem, the alphabet will consist of only lowercase letters ('a'-'z'). For example, if  message is "hello" and his cipher maps 'h' to 'q', 'e' to 'w', 'l' to 'e' and 'o' to 'r', the encoded message will be "qweer". Given the original message, determine the cipher that will produce the encoded string that comes earliest alphabetically. Return this encoded string.    Input The first line consists of a number t representing the number of test case. Then, t lines follow each containing the message that will be less than 10,000 characters. It will contain only lowercase letters ('a'-'z').   Output Output the Cipher message for each message.   Example  Input: 2 hello sachin   Output: abccd abcdef

  After coming to college, Harry decided to have a get together with friends. So he contacted Chahak who is a renowned event organiser. She is given the task of managing this lavish party. Harry is fond of eating and his friend Joseph is fond of cracking jokes. As per Harry’s demand, Chahak kept N food items in the party. It will take exactly ti minutes to finish the ith item. Joseph who is a comedian will crack jokes. All his jokes are of exactly 5 minutes. The problem she faces is that after tasting each dish, Harry needs a break of 10 minutes to digest it. On the other hand, Joseph being a very active person doesn’t need any rest but he wants everyone’s attention when he cracks a joke, so Harry cannot eat at the same time. Now Chahak wants to make an Optimal time schedule such that: 1) The party can go on for d minutes. 2) Harry must taste all the dishes. 3) Joseph should crack jokes as many as possible. Help Chahak to find out if it’s possible to make such a schedule!    Input  The first line of input contains T, Number of test cases.

  The war has been declared in the Clash of Clans and the clan's leader has designed a smart strategy to confirm his side's victory in this war. His strategy is as follows -  When any member of his clan member will attack at any member of the enemy's clan then the attacker's army will consist of only two types of troops - Lava Hounds "L" and P.E.K.K.A. "P"(as these two are the mightiest troops),  The attacker's army should be balanced, i.e., if the attacker's army consists of N troops then in any continuous section of the army the difference between the number of P.E.K.K.A. and Lava Hounds must be atmost 2.  An army will be represented as a string of Lava Hounds "L" and P.E.K.K.A. "P". Example : If the army consists of N=5 troops, then there are 14 possible combinations for a balanced army ( condition number 2 ). The Lexicographical Order of this is - LLPLP, LLPPL, LPLLP, LPLPL, LPLPP, LPPLL, LPPLP, PLLPL, PLLPP, PLPLL, PLPLP, PLPPL, PPLLP and PPLPL. All the possible balanced combinations of army of a certain length N can be ordered lexicographically with index starting from 1. Example for N=5, army at number 7 is LPPLP (see in the above example). Since the leader is busy in donating the troops to his clan members therefore he needs your help in finding the number(index) assigned to an army for a given value of N(number of P.E.K.K.A. and Lava Hounds in army). There can be large number of such possible combinations for a particular value of N therefore output the result modulo M.     Input  The first line of input contains N, the number of troops in the army. The second line contains the value of modulo, M. The third line contains a string of N characters "L" (Lava Hounds) or "P" (P.E.K.K.A.) that represents a balanced army.     Output  Output the number assigned to the army modulo M.     Constraints Example Input 1: 5 4 LPPLP  Output 1: 3  Input 2: 1 7 P  Output 2: 2    Explanation Example case 1.The actual position of LPPLP in the list of possible combinations is 7. Therefore 7 modulo 4 is 3. (See above example for the combinations) 
We know that there are so many calendar systems. For example, Bangla, Christ, Arabic, Chinese etc. This problem is about Decimal calendar. There are 3 months in this calendar. First month is "Hundreds". There are 300 days in this month. Second month is "Tens". There are 60 days in this month. And this followed by the last month "Ones" having 5 or 6 days depending on whether this is leap year or not. A Decimal year spans a full Christ calendar. That is 1st Hundreds in Decimal Calendar is 1st January in Christi Calendar. Similarly, 31st December of Christ Calendar is 5th or 6th day of Decimal calendar (depending on whether it is leap year or not).  A year in Decimal calendar is leap year if the corresponding Christ year is leap year. For example, the Decimal year corresponding to 2000 Christ year is leap year but 2001 is not, and again 1900 is not leap year too. A year in Christ calendar is leap year if the year is divisible by 400 or divisible by 4 but not by 100.  You are given a day in Christ calendar in DD-MMM-YYYY format (DD stands for day, MMM stands for first three letters (in CAPS) of the month and YYYY stands for the year). You are to give the date in Decimal Calendar format.   Input First line contains number of test case. Every test case consists of a date in Christ Calendar format in each line.   Output You are to output the case number and the date in Decimal Calendar format. Output the date and the month in the Decimal Calendar.   Example  Input: 3 01-JAN-1900 10-JAN-1900 16-DEC-1900  Output: Case 1: 1 Hundreds Case 2: 10 Hundreds Case 3: 50 Tens  Note First three letters for the months are: JAN, FEB, MAR, APR, MAY, JUN, JUL, AUG, SEP, OCT, NOV, DEC. 
Long ago during the Jurassic Park age, there was a company TopHunters, which used to conduct hunting competitions for the Dinosaurs around the world. Petrosaurus was believed to be the greatest hunter of that time and all other dinosaurs enjoyed watching the hunting videos posted by him in the forums ( yes, they had a website :) ). Many Indian dinosaurs used to post in sms language in the forums and annoy others. Vexosaurus was so annoyed reading the posts with numbers used in place of letters. He decided to correct all those posts, before the forums get Rusty. Could you please code for him and replace the following words in 1st column with their corresponding words in 2nd column     8ate w8wait gr8great 4for b4before           Lets not make this complex and just replace the words when they appear entirely as a word themselves, and not as a subpart of bigger words ( see examples for clarity ). A word is a continuous sequence of non-space characters. Disclaimer : This is just a fictional story. Any resemblance to real persons or company or dinosaurs is purely coincidental ;)   Input First line contains T [ number of test cases, around 50 ]. Each of the next T lines contains a sentence with not more than 100 characters [ 'a' - 'z' , '0' - '9' , space ].

Sircar is considered to be one of the greatest magicians of all time and you have a chance to get a lucky ticket to his show! Sircar shows you one of his most divine tricks of magical illusion. The trick is as follows: He has 2 decks of cards, deck A and deck B. Number of cards in deck A is N and number of cards in deck B is M. Deck A has cards numbered from 1 to N, while deck B has cards numbered from N+1 to N+M. He shuffles both the deck of cards pretty well, so we can be sure that no two adjacent cards have absolute difference less than 2. Now he shows you the cards of each deck one by one, i.e. , one card from deck A and one card from deck B. He keeps showing them till both the deck have cards. Once one of the decks is out of cards, it is replaced by infinite cards having the value 0. Now the cards are continued to be shown in the given fashion until one of the deck goes out of cards and this is the point where the magic trick ends. At this point, Sircar turns to you and asks, "Can you tell me the sum of the differences of every two cards that I have shown you during the magic trick?". As a brilliant mathematician and observer that you are, you need to answer his queries efficiently, so that you don't lose out on the chance to see the BIG MAGIC TRICK! Note: For every round, difference = value of card of deck B - value of card of deck A. Note:The input is very large. Don't use slow I/O methods like cin/cout  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. Each of the T lines that follow have two space separated integers, N and M.  Output For every test case, print out the answer as required. (Sum of difference can be negative too!)  Constraints  1 <= T <= 10^6 3 < N <= 10^8 3 < M <= 10^8   Example Input: 2 4 6 6 4  Output: 35 13  Explanation Example case 1. Let us assume the deck A after shuffling will be the 3,1,4,2 and deck B will be 6,8,5,9,7,10. Let us see how the cards are shown and answer is calculated :  card from A = 3, card from B = 6, difference = 3 card from A = 1, card from B = 8, difference = 7 card from A = 4, card from B = 5, difference = 1 card from A = 2, card from B = 9, difference = 7  Now A is replaced by infinite cards of value 0.  card from A = 0, card from B = 7, difference = 7 card from A = 0, card from B = 10,difference = 10  Sum of differences is : 3 + 7 + 1 + 7 + 7 + 10 = 35. 
Rohit just started his 3rd semester classes in DMS. One of the interesting parts of DMS is set theory. He has just learnt about Power Set of any set, which is the number of ways in which you can create a unique subset from the existing set. Two subsets are said to be different if atleast one element in both the subsets are different. Given the number of elements in the set, you need to print out the size of power set that can be obtained from the main set. Since the answer can be pretty huge, you need to print the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each of the T lines that follow have the number N denoting the number of elements in the main set.  Output For each test case, print out the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.  Constraints  1 <= T <= 1000 0 <= N <= 10^15   Example Input: 2 1 3  Output: 2 8  Explanation Example case 2.

Example case 2. For N = 10, F(N) = 4, as the factors of 10 are { 1, 2, 5, 10 }. Hence answer is No. 
 Problem Description   You are being attacked by hostile enemy forces, with knights and swordsmen charging at you. Being the commander of your unit, you have been given the task of arranging your elite archers and pikemen in a special formation.  The archers and pikemen must stand between two flag posts in a straight line (no soldier can stand beyond the flags). Each archer must have at least two pikemen by his side (one to his left and one to his right) such that he is at equal distances from both of them. (A pikeman may be shared between two archers).   The archers stand at given fixed positions and the separations between them may not be equal. You need to position your troops in the given formation using the minimum number of pikemen.   Assume that the minimum distance between a pikeman and an archer or a pikeman and a flag is 1 unit. the minimum distance between two archers is 2 units.   Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follow.  The second line contains an integer N denoting the number of separations.  The following N lines each contain an integer x, which is the separation of the current archer from the previous one.   The first value of x is the separation of the first archer from the first flag. The last value of x is the separation between the last archer and the second flag    Output  For each test case, output a single line containing  the minimum number of pikemen required.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 1000 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000     Example Input:  2 3 4 4 2 4 2 2 2 2   Output:  3 4     Explanation Example case 1: A possible formation can be : F---1---p---3---A---3---p---1---A---1---p---1--- F  Example case 2: A possible formation can be : F---1---p---1---A---1---p---1---A---1---p---1---A---1---p---1---F F = flag A = archer p = pikeman ---d--- = distance between pikeman and archer/flag

  They See Me Rollin  This input refers to this board  Output:       There are a series of zig-zag platforms, each platform of different length, making an angle of either 45 or 135 degrees with the horizontal. Let's say     there are n such platforms (like those in the figure). A ball is dropped on the top most platform. The ball rolls down the platform and falls on the lower     platform. The ball may or may not land on a platform, depending on the difference of length of the lower platform with the upper one. Finally the ball will     fall on the last platform and then into the box. Note that the ball may not fall into the box when the last platform's length is short, in that case it     will be a "fall-through".        For this program, you will have to specify the number of platforms n , the length of each platform and you have to determine which platforms the ball will     fall on. The last line of output will be a string specifying whether the ball will fall into the box or not. Print "SUCCESS" if the ball falls into the     box, else print "FAIL".     Input       The first line consists of an integer specifying number of test cases T. For each test case, first line will specify the number of platforms N. Then,The     next line contains N integers l1, ..., ln separated by spaces each specify an integer corresponding to the platform length as Pli = li√2. (i.e if l = 2     then platform length will be 2√2).       Output       Each line of output will specify the platform number on which the ball lands on. The last line of output will be a string, either "SUCCESS" or "FAIL",     depending upon the status of ball in the box.   Sample Input 7 7 2 8 10 24 16 44   Sample Output 1 3 5 7 SUCCESS    
  A guy named Cman attends the final grade of a high school. One day Cman decided to watch a match of his favorite football team. And, as the boy loves football very much, even more than linear algebra, he forgot to do the homework. Specifically, he forgot to complete his linear algebra tasks. Next day the teacher got very angry at Cman and decided to teach him a lesson. He gave the lazy student a seemingly easy task: You are given an idle body in space and the forces that affect it. The body can be considered as a material point with coordinates (0, 0, 0). Cman had only to answer whether it is in equilibrium. According to the teacher a body is considered to be in equilibrium if and only if the coordinates of the resulting vectors are prime numbers. So, Cman began to solve the problem. But later it turned out that there can be lots and lots of these forces, and Cman can not cope without your help. Help him. Write a program that determines whether a body is idle or is moving by the given vectors of forces. Note : The resulting vector acting on a body is the vector having x, y and z coordinate as sum of all x[i], y[i] and z[i] respectively.    Input First line of input will contain a single integer “T” representing number of test cases. First line of each test case will contain a single integer “N” denoting number of force vectors acting on the idle body. Next N lines will contain three space separated integer i.e. x[i] coordinate, y[i] coordinate and z[i] coordinate of force vector i..  Output For each test output the word "YES" if the body is in equilibrium, or the word "NO" if it is not  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000 0 ≤ x[i] ≤ 100 0 ≤ y[i] ≤ 100 0 ≤ z[i] ≤ 100     Example Input: 2 3 2 1 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 3 5 7 11 3 7 5 3 5 3  Output: NO YES     Explanation Example case 1.When we sum up the force vector i.e. sum up x[i], y[i] and z[i] we got 11, 14, 18 i.e. (2+4+3, 1+5+8, 3+6+9) so the y and z coordinate of the resulting vector are not prime so the body is not in equilibrium state. Hence, we print NO for first test-case. 
 Reversed number is a number written in arabic numerals but the order of digits is reversed.  The first digit becomes last and vice versa. For example, if the number is 1245,it will become  5421 .Note that all the leading zeros are omitted. That means if the number ends with a zero,  the zero is lost by reversing (e.g. 1200 gives 21). Also note that the reversed number never has  any trailing zeros. Your task is to add two reversed numbers and output their reversed sum. Of  course, the result is not unique because any particular number is a reversed form of several  numbers (e.g. 21 could be 12, 120 or 1200 before reversing). Thus we must assume that no zeros  were lost by reversing (e.g. assume that the original number was 12).    Input  The input consists of N cases (equal to about 10000). The first line of the input contains  only positive integer N. Then follow the cases. Each case consists of exactly one line with  two positive integers separated by space. These are the reversed numbers you are to add.     Output  For each case, print exactly one line containing only one integer - the reversed sum of  two reversed numbers. Omit any leading zeros in the output.    Example  Input: 1 24 1  Output: 34   
 A positive integer is called a palindrome if its representation in the  decimal system is the same when read from left to right and from right  to left. For a given positive integer K of not more than 5 digits,  write the value of the smallest palindrome larger than K to output.  Numbers are always displayed without leading zeros.   Input    The first line contains integer t, the number of test cases.  Integers K are given in the next t lines.     Output   For each K, output the smallest palindrome larger than K.    Example  Input: 1 808  Output: 818   
 Given two binary strings, A (of length 10) and B (of length 5),  output 1 if B is a substring of A and 0 otherwise.    Input  The first line contains the number of test cases n. This is followed by n lines each consisting of pairs of binary strings A and B separated by a single space.    Output  output 1 if B is a substring of A and 0 otherwise.    Example  Input: 1 1010110010 10110  Output: 1  
 Ramesh is contemplating putting a new flooring throughout his house, but he has an important constraint: no tiles must be cut in the process of tiling any room. The floor of every room must be completely tiled, and all tiles in a particular room must be orientated the same way. This will make it easier for him to count tiles in any room that he is in because he won't have to estimate, and subsequently, add fractions of tiles into the total. Of course Willard is quite happy to put different tiles in each room to make counting them more interesting. Fortunately, the dimensions of every room in Ramesh's house are integral(interger) number units on each side and every room is a perfect rectangle. As well, Willard has found a tile manufacture that offers a variety of tile sizes, all of which, by coincidence are also an integral(integer) number of units on each side. Of course, the tiles are rectangular. The manufacture, who offers the different sizes for aesthetic reasons, and not to satisfy the somewhat compulsive behaviors of the likes of Willard, is somewhat taken aback b y Ramesh's request that the manufacture guarantee that a particular size of tile will exactly cover a room (i.e., the whole floor is covered and no tile is cut).However, the manufacturer is business minded and asks you to write a simple computer program. This program will help them match tile sizes up for each room in Ramesh's house and thereby meet his request.   Input  The first line contains the number of test cases. Following lines represent a single room in the house and a possible tile to be used in that room. Each line contains 4 integer values. The first two values are the dimensions of a room and the last two values are that of a tile. No room is larger than 250 X 250, no tile is larger than 50 X 50 and Ramesh's house has no more rooms than 100.   Output  Each line represents the answer for a particular room(the first line for the first room, the second line for the second room etc.). If the room can be exactly tiled with the tiles of the given dimension then the line would consist of the word "yes" else "no".   Example  Input: 1 50 70 2 3  Output: no

  All of you know about Fibbonacci series. It is a series where F(n)=F(n-1)+F(n-2) and F(0)=F(1)=1; Now, when the professor was teaching Fibbonacci series, then a student had mistakenly copied the co-efficients and the starting values wrong. He wrote F(n)=2*F(n-1)+3*F(n-2); and F(0)=2 and F(1)=5; Now, he was getting the series all wrong. Anyway, he decided to name this series as 'False Fibbonacci Series' and he is now interested in finding the Nth term of this fibbonacci series. Now, he asks you for help and you being his friend, agree on helping him. Now find the Nth term of this 'False Fibbonacci Series'. As the answer can be big, print it modulo 10^9+7.    Input The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.

The series goes like 2,5,16,47. 2 is the 0th term, 5 is the 1st term and so on. 
  In the country of Numberia, there is a city called Primeland. Sherry is one of the rich inhabitants of the city, who likes to collect coins of various denominations. Coins in primeland are little strange , they are only available in prime denominations (i.e as coins of value 2,3,5 etc.).Sherry is taking a tour of the country but as he visits people ask him for change, unfortunately Sherry took coins of only two kinds of denominations(the coins are of Primeland), he has already made a lot of such changes but then he wonders what is the maximum amount which he can't give change for using the coins he has.Remember he has coins of only two different denominations and has infinite number of them..    Input First line of input will contain number of testcases,T.Following T lines will contain two integers c and d separated by a space denoting the denominations which sherry has while he is on the tour, both c and d are guaranteed to be prime.    Output For each of the T testcases output one number per line the maximum amount which sherry can't afford to give change for.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 2 ≤ c,d ≤ 10^6     Example Input: 2 3 5 2 3  Output: 7 1    Explanation For Test Case 1 : We see that 2 cannot be paid using coins of value 3 and 5. In fact we can pay the following series of numbers using coins of value 3 and 5. 3,5,6,8,9,10.....and so on. Clearly we cannot make change for 1,2,4,7. Out of these numbers 7 is maximum therefore 7 is the correct answer. Basically find the list of numbers for which change can't be made using the two coins given in the input and print the maximum of those numbers as your answer.

Petr is fond of many colours and so he decided to colour many sketches which he has made during his free time. There are N sketches made and K colours available. He can colour each sketch in any colour possible. Obviously he wants to add variety to the sketches, by making a deep contrast between them. So he decides to colour them making sure that no two adjacent sketches are of same colour as well as 1st and last sketch do not have same colour, 2nd and 2nd last do not have same colour , 3rd and 3rd last and so on. Find out the number of ways in which he can colour all the sketches. Each way is different in which different colour is used for that sketch. As the answer can be very large , find it modulo 1000000007.   Input The first line is T, which is the number of test cases. Each test case consists of N and K which is number of sketches and colours.   Output For each test case, find out the number of ways possible mod 1000000007.   Constraints: 1 ≤ T ≤ 100000 1 ≤ N,K ≤ 10^5   Example Input: 2 2 2 3 2 Output: 2 0

Two friends Alice and Bob were once quarreling among themselves as to who will get hold of the box of chocolates brought by their aunt. Alice, shrewd and cunning as she is, makes a plan to stop this issue and get hold of the box. She challenged Bob a problem which he has to solve then and there only in front of her. The problem is stated very simply as: Given an array of N non - negative integers  ai, and a number K, Bob can remove elements from either side of the array, i.e either from first or last, such that the resultant array satisfies the condition that max(ai) - min (ai) = K. He has to minimize the number of elements removed and hence find the length of the resultant array. The resultant array must obey the condition above after removing elements from the sides. If there is no length which satisfies above then print "0" (quotes for clarity). Input The first line contains T which denotes the number of test cases. Then for each test case we have 2 lines, N and K. Then the next line has N space separated integers ai. Output For each test case print the corresponding answer. Constraints 1 ≤ T ≤ 5 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 0 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9 0 ≤ K ≤ 10^9 Example Input: 2 4 4 2 3 4 6 3 3 1 2 3 Output: 4 0   Explanation: The first example, Bob doesn't need to remove anything as the whole array satisfies it. The second example, even if Bob removes everything, there is no possibility hence the remaining length is 0.

Rohan and Digits Rohan is very fond of digits (0-9). He has a maths project at school and was asked to bring something cool. So he thought of cutting out digits in a piece of chart paper and coloring them with different colors.While he was doing this, he noticed that, for digit 0, he had one hole in the chart paper. A hole can be of any shape. So, 0,4,6,9 all has one hole. 8 has two holes. Rest of the digits don't have holes. Rohan was thinking of writing some computer program to enhance his programming skill. But he needs to verify his solution. Help him. Now, as a programmer what you have to do is pretty simple. Given a specific number of holes x, you have to print the smallest integer having x holes in it. Note that this number should not have any leading zeros.  INPUT The first line contains an integer x, which represents number of holes  CONTRAINTS :   0 <= x <= 510   OUTPUT : For each test case, print the smallest integer containing exactly x holes in it. Note: Output can be very very long.  SAMPLE TESTS: INPUT-1:  0  OUTPUT-1: 1 INPUT-2:  1  OUTPUT-2: 0 INPUT-3:  5  OUTPUT-3: 488  Explaination for sample test case 3 : 4 has one hole, 8 has two holes. So total holes = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. 
Nikhil loves to play FlappyBirds (who doesn't!). He plays it on his brother Nitin's mobile since he doesn't own one. One day, as usual, Nikhil comes to ask Nitin if he can play the game. Nitin challenges Nikhil to write code for a puzzle he's been trying to solve for last three days. If Nikhil solve's it, he can play. But alas! Nikhil is not an expert programmer like you. He needs your help. Help Nikhil play FlappyBirds! The puzzle is simple. You have a 4 x 4 grid. Some of the cells in the grid are black and some white. 'b' represents black and 'a' represents white. Eg.             babb            bbbb            aaaa            aabb  The task is to change the color of at-most one cell to the other color (ie. a -> b, b -> a) so that you can form a 2 x 2 grid, with all cells of the same color.  INPUT  Input has four lines, containing four characters each. If the j-th character of the i-th line is 'b', that cell is black, and so on.  OUTPUT Print "POSSIBLE" (without the quotes) if it's possible to complete the task and "NOT POSSIBLE" (without the quotes) otherwise.   Sample Test: Sample Test 1 Input    bbbb  abaa  bbbb  aaaa  Sample Test 1 Output POSSIBLE Sample Test 2 Input    bbbb  aaaa  bbbb  aaaa  Sample Test 2 Output NOT POSSIBLE  Explanation for Sample Test 1 : If we re-paint the 1st cell at 2nd row, we can get a 2 x 2 grid of all cells 'b'. 
 Lazy Puzzle Aashish was sitting in a park with Chirag. Aashish wanted to prove Chirag about his puzzle solving skills and asks Chirag to give him a puzzle.  Chirag being a lazy person gives Aashish a lazy puzzle to solve. He gives him a sequence of n digits and asks him to make a number from these digits with each of the digit d used exactly once and all of the digits in the sequence should be used. The number should be such that it should have the smallest number of factors among all the numbers which can be generated using these digits. Leading zeros can be skipped and should not be printed in the output. If there is a tie among the numbers then give the smallest number among them. Help Aashish solve the puzzle.  CONSTRAINTS :   1<=n<=5  0<=d<=9  There will be at least one non zero digit in the sequence   SAMPLE TESTS: INPUT1:   	2 4  OUTPUT1: 24  Note for INPUT1: Among 24 and 42, 24 has the least number of factors(1,2,3,4,6,8,12,24).

Cersei And Her Energy Game Cersei Lannister likes to play difficult games but this Energy Game is little too difficult for her ,so you have to help her out. There is a one-dimensional road. The road is separated into N consecutive parts. The parts are numbered 0 through N-1, in order. Cersei is going to walk from part 0 to part N-1. Cersei also noticed that each part of the road has a color: either red, green, or blue. Part 0 is red. Cersei is going to perform a sequence of steps. Each step must lead in the positive direction. That is, if her current part is i, the next step will take her to one of the parts i+1 through N-1, inclusive. Her steps can be arbitrarily long. However, longer steps are harder: a step of length j costs j*j energy. Additionally, Cersei wants to step on colors in a specific order: red, green, blue, red, green, blue, ... That is, she starts on the red part 0, makes a step to a green part, from there to a blue part, and so on, always repeating red, green, and blue in a cycle. Note that the final part N-1 also has some color and thus Cersei must reach it in a corresponding step.  INPUT: First line consist of 't' number of test cases. The next  't' lines, each line has a string representing the road (each string has 'N' elements) . For each i, element i of string is the color of part i: 'R' represents red, 'G' green, and 'B' blue.  CONSTRAINTS: Following holds for each string in input:  string will contain between 2 and 15 characters, inclusive. each character of string will be either 'R' or 'G' or 'B'. The first character of string will be 'R'.  1<= t <=30   OUTPUT: If Cersei can reach part N-1 in the way described above, print the smallest possible total cost of doing so. Otherwise, print -1.

 After getting placed you went to a party, after the party you got very HIGH. So out of fun you collected all the N (numbered 0 to N-1) dustbins of your hostel and kept them in front of your room. You also bought infinite number of balls, Then initially you added some balls in each dustbin. Now being really high you started these three tasks 1) You can empty the whole dustbin(D). 2) You can add M number of balls to K^th dustbin 3) You want to know the total number of balls from i^th dustbin to j^th dustbin (both inclusive).   Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.  Then T test cases follow, each test case will start with integer N and Q, the number of dustbins and number of tasks. Then in the next line, you will have n integers giving the initial number of balls in each dustbin (which will be less than 1000). Then Q lines follow, each of the Q lines will contain two or three integers, the first of them will be the task type If task type is 1, then 1 will be followed by single integer(D), the dustbin to be emptied. If task type is 2, then 2 will be followed by two integers(K and M), specifying that M balls are to be added to the K^th dustbin. If task type is 3, then 3 will be followed be two integers(i and j), range for which the total count of number of balls is to be retrieved.   Output For each test case,  if the task type is 1, then output the number of balls that have been removed from that dustbin to make it empty and if task type is 3 then output the total number of balls from ith dustbin to jth dustbin.

Chef while sitting at a coffee shop sees a girl making horizontal and vertical lines on a rectangular sheet of paper and then doing some counting. Chef being a maths freak, gathers courage and walks up to the girl to inquire what she is upto. The girl tells Chef that she has been given an arduous task of making M and N number of horizontal and vertical lines respectively on the sheet of paper and find the total number of quadrilaterals formed by it. Chef being from engineering background, knew a shortcut to solve this. So he tries to impress the girl, by telling her that he will make her task easy. All she has to do is to tell him the number of horizontal and vertical lines and Chef will tell her the number of quadrilaterals formed. If the Chef succeeds, the girl would go on a date with him.   Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each test case contains two space separated integers M and N, where M is the number of horizontal lines and N is the number of vertical lines.

You have a tree consisting of n vertices. You want to color each vertex of the tree in one of the k colors such that for any pair of vertices having same color, all the vertices belonging to the path joining them should also have same color. In other words, for any two vertices u, v with same color, all the vertices in the path joining them should also have color same as that of the u (or same as v, as u and v have same color).  Find out possible number of ways in which you can color the tree satisfying the above property. As the answer could be large, print your answer modulo 10^9 + 7.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. For each test case, first line contains two space separated integers n, k denoting number of vertices in the tree and total number of colors, respectively Each of the next n - 1 lines contain two space separated integers ui, vi, denoting that there is an edge between vertices ui and vi in the tree.  Output For each test case, output a single line corresponding to number of ways of coloring the tree.

Note that you can't color the tree in {1, 2, 1} as the vertices in the path connecting vertex 1 and 3, (i.e. 1, 2, 3) don't have same color. You can see that the color of 2nd vertex is not same as that of 1st and 3rd. In the second example, Only possible coloring you can do is to color all the vertices with color 1.

Aman loves solving English puzzles. His teacher taught him a new topic today called Contiguous Words. A contiguous word is a word in which all the occurrences of each letter of the word is together (i.e. no same letter should be separated by one or more other letters). For example, "aaabb" and "abc" are contiguous word. "bitotsav" is not a contiguous word since the 't's don't occur together. For the weekends the teacher gave Aman a homework on contiguous word. The homework is as follows: The teacher divided contiguous word into several parts. Aman has to form the original contiguous word and print it. If more than one contiguous word can be formed print "MORE THAN ONE". If a contiguous word cannot be formed from the given parts print "NOT POSSIBLE" (all quotes for clarity). Input Specification  First line will contain the no. of test cases T. Each test case contains two lines of input. The first line contains the no. of parts K. The second line contains K strings separated by a single space, denoting parts.   Output Specification  If only one contiguous word can be formed print the word. If many such words can be formed print "MORE THAN ONE". If no such contiguous word can be formed print "NOT POSSIBLE".   Constraints  1<=T<=300 1<=K<=50 Each part will contain between 1 to 20 characters, inclusive. Each character of the parts will contain only lowercase letters (a-z).   Sample Input   4 3 zzzz zz z 2 ro ar 3 ro a r 2 ac cca   Sample Output   zzzzzzz arro MORE THAN ONE NOT POSSIBLE  
The chef has just finished baking several pies, and it's time to place them on cooling racks. The chef has exactly as many cooling racks as pies.  Each cooling rack can only hold one pie, and each pie may only be held by one cooling rack, but the chef isn't confident that the cooling racks can support the weight of the pies. The chef knows the weight of each pie, and has assigned each cooling rack a maximum weight limit. What is the maximum number of pies the chef can cool on the racks?  Input: Input begins with an integer T≤30, the number of test cases. Each test case consists of 3 lines. The first line of each test case contains a positive integer N≤30, the number of pies (and also the number of racks). The second and third lines each contain exactly positive N integers not exceeding 100. The integers on the second line are the weights of the pies, and the integers on the third line are the weight limits of the cooling racks.  Output: For each test case, output on a line the maximum number of pies the chef can place on the racks.  Sample input: 2 3 10 30 20 30 10 20 5 9 7 16 4 8 8 3 14 10 10   Sample output: 3 4  
It's placement time at IISc! All students are busy studying for interiews and preparing their resumes. Lalit is also appearing for the placements. He has made a list of all companies along with their salaries, in the order of their date for placement(i.e the order in which the companies are going to come for placements,the salaries can be totally random). Being more mathematically oriented, he has also compiled the probabilities of his getting selected by each company. The placement process is as follows. Any student can write as many companies as he wants, as long as he is not selected by any company. Once he is selected by some company, his placement ends, and he cannot write any more companies. Lalit wants to devise a strategy such that he would write only those companies such that his expected salary is high. His strategy should take into consideration his chances of getting into a particular company and whether it is safe to not sit for a company in case he wishes to apply for a higher paying company. You must help Lalit decide which companies he should write, and which he shouldn't, in order to get the highest expected salary.    Input The first line of input contains 'T', the number of test cases (1 ≤ T ≤ 1000). This is followed by T test cases. Each test case consists of a blank line followed by three lines. The first line contains a single number 'N', the number of companies (1 ≤ N ≤ 100000). The next line consists of 'N' integers separated by spaces, which are the salaries of the companies, in order. The third line consists of 'N' floating point numbers separated by spaces, which are the probabilities of Pratik's getting selected by the companies, in order.    Output The output should consist of 'T' lines corresponding to the 'T' test cases. Each line should contain one floating point number, accurate to 6 decimal places, which is the best expected salary.   Example  Input: 2  2 10000 20000 0.5 0.3  3 40000 10000 20000 0.6 0.3 0.8    Output: 8000.000000 30400.000000  
Pratik has built a line follower bot. A line follower is essentially a robot which can follow a white line and the participant is graded based upon how effectively his robot performs the task at hand. Pratik decided to enter a Robotics contest to see how his bot fared over the others. The contest however had another small task that the bot was required to perform. The arena on which the robot was to be judged was a small 2-D matrix or grid with a black background and the lines of the grid were either red or white in color. The white lines formed a closed path, i.e. it always ended at the starting point, and no two white lines intersected. The robot was required to follow only the white lines and count the number of squares enclosed within this area. Pratik noticed red dots at the intersection of any two lines. These red dots were the corners of the squares in the grid. Pratik realized that his bot could still win the contest if he can write an extra piece of code which takes in the directions followed by his bot as input and calculates the number of squares enclosed. He reconfigured his bot such that it reported the direction in which it was travelling as and when it detected a red dot. So the input from the robot was of the form North, South, East, West. The dots were unit length apart. Help Pratik win this contest by figuring out an algorithm which takes in these sequence of steps and gives out the total area enclosed within this path.     Input The first line of input contains 'T', the number of test cases (1 ≤ T ≤ 1000). This is followed by 'T' test cases. Each test case consists of one line containing a string (of length upto 100000) which is the sequence of steps ('N', 'S', 'E' or 'W') taken.   Output The output should consist of 'T' lines corresponding to the 'T' test cases. Each line should contain one number, which is the area enclosed by the walk.   Example  Input: 3 ENWS ENWWSSEN NENESSWSSWWNEN   Output: 1 3 6  
Girish has recently joined IISc. Being a highly enthusiastic student he wants to attend as many classes as possible. He has prepared a list of classes he wants to attend along with their timings.

CUO01 - EASY Sorting   Problem description. Given an array containing a permutation of 1 to n, you have to find the minimum number of swaps to sort the array in ascending order. A swap means, you can exchange any two elements of the array. For example, let n = 4, and the array be 4 2 3 1, then you can sort it in ascending order in just 1 swaps (by swapping 4 and 1).     Input Input description. Input starts with an integer T (<= 100), denoting the number of test cases. Each case contains two lines, the first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100). The next line contains n integers separated by spaces. You may assume that the array will always contain a permutation of 1 to n.   Output Output description. For each case, print the case number and the minimum number of swaps required to sort the array in ascending order.  Example Sample input 1 4 4 2 3 1 sample output Case 1: 1 
50 POINTS   Each of you probably has your personal experience of riding public transportation and buying tickets. After a person buys a ticket (which traditionally has an even number of digits), he usually checks whether the ticket is lucky. Let us remind you that a ticket is lucky if the sum of digits in its first half matches the sum of digits in its second half.  But of course, not every ticket can be lucky. Far from it! Moreover, sometimes one look at a ticket can be enough to say right away that the ticket is not lucky. So, let's consider the following unluckiness criterion that can definitely determine an unlucky ticket. We'll say that a ticket is definitely unlucky if each digit from the first half corresponds to some digit from the second half so that each digit from the first half is strictly less than the corresponding digit from the second one or each digit from the first half is strictly more than the corresponding digit from the second one. Each digit should be used exactly once in the comparisons. In other words, there is such bijective correspondence between the digits of the first and the second half of the ticket, that either each digit of the first half turns out strictly less than the corresponding digit of the second half or each digit of the first half turns out strictly more than the corresponding digit from the second half.  For example, ticket 2421 meets the following unluckiness criterion and will not be considered lucky (the sought correspondence is 2 > 1 and 4 > 2), ticket 0135 also meets the criterion (the sought correspondence is 0 < 3 and 1 < 5), and ticket 3754 does not meet the criterion.   You have a ticket in your hands, it contains 2n digits. Your task is to check whether it meets the unluckiness criterion.    Input The first line contains an integer n . The second line contains a string that consists of 2n digits and defines your ticket.    Output In the first line print "YES" if the ticket meets the unluckiness criterion. Otherwise, print "NO" (without the quotes).    Constraints  1 ≤  n  ≤ 100     Example Input: 2 2421  Output: YES   
250 POINTS   Bhuvesh takes out his Snakes and Ladders game and stares at the board, and wonders: If he had absolute control on the die, and could get it to generate any number (in the range 1-6) he desired, what would be the least number of rolls of the die in which he'd be able to reach the destination square (Square Number 100) after having started at the base square (Square Number 1)?  Rules  Bhuvesh has total control over the die and the face which shows up every time he tosses it. You need to help him figure out the minimum number of moves in which he can reach the target square (100) after starting at the base (Square 1). A die roll which would cause the player to land up at a square greater than 100, goes wasted, and the player remains at his original square. Such as a case when the player is at Square Number 99, rolls the die, and ends up with a 5. If a person reaches a square which is the base of a ladder, (s)he has to climb up that ladder, and he cannot come down on it. If a person reaches a square which has the mouth of the snake, (s)he has to go down the snake and come out through the tail - there is no way to climb down a ladder or to go up through a snake.   Input  The first line contains the number of tests, T. T testcases follow. For each testcase, there are 3 lines. The first line contains the number of ladders and snakes, separated by a comma. The second is a list of comma separated pairs indicating the starting and ending squares of the ladders. The first point is the square from which a player can ascend and the second point is his final position. The third is a list of comma separated pairs indicating the starting and ending (mouth and tail) squares of the snakes. the first point is the position of the mouth of the snake and the second one is the tail. Multiple comma separated pairs of snakes and ladders are separated by a single space.     Output Output description.  For each of the T test cases, output one integer, each of a new line, which is the least number of moves (or rolls of the die) in which the player can reach the target square (Square Number 100) after starting at the base (Square Number 1). This corresponds to the ideal sequence of faces which show up when the die is rolled.     Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ Number of snakes, Number of ladders  ≤ 15     Example Input: 3 3,7 32,62 42,68 12,98 95,13 97,25 93,37 79,27 75,19 49,47 67,17 5,8 32,62 44,66 22,58 34,60 2,90 85,7 63,31 87,13 75,11 89,33 57,5 71,15 55,25 4,9 8,52 6,80 26,42 2,72 51,19 39,11 37,29 81,3 59,5 79,23 53,7 43,33 77,21  Output: 3 3 5   
Problem description: After failing to destroy the Republic with the 'Starkiller', Kylo Ren now wants to complete his mission with a new weapon. He wishes to use the mighty weapon 'Deathstar' to destroy the planets of the Republic. There are  n planets in the Republic, each present at a 2D coordinate (x,y). He has only one charge left in his 'Deathstar'. He can place it at any coordinate and fire it, destroying all planets which are at a distance of  M or less from the Deathstar. He needs to find a position to place the Deathstar so that atleast n/4 planets are destroyed on its detonation. Help him defeat the Rebels.  Input First line contains n and  M, the number of planets in the republic and the annihilation radius of Deathstar. Each of the next  n lines contains two integers x and y, the coordinates of the i'th planet.  Output Print space separated coordinates x and y, a location of the Deathstar such that it destroys atleast ceil(n/4) of the Republic's planets. If there are several such positions, any position will do. If no such position exists, output "Impossible" (without the quotes).  Constraints  1 ≤ n ≤ 100000 1 ≤ M ≤ 10000 -M ≤ x, y ≤ M     Example Input: 4 10 1 1 2 2 -3 4 -10 -10  Output: 0 0    Explanation Placing the Starkiller at (0,0) destroys all planets except the last one. 
Problem description: Sonu got bored of playing Solitaire all day, and has invented a new game of cards that he can play by himself.

Galileo's latest project involves determining the density of stars in certain regions of the sky. For this purpose he started looking for datasets online, and discovered a dataset on Newton's blog. Newton had decomposed the night sky into a Voronoi tessellation with the generators arranged in a grid. He has stored the number of stars in a Voronoi cell at a position in a matrix that corresponds to the position of the generator in the grid. This dataset does not directly help Galileo, because he needs to be able to query the number of stars in a rectangular portion of the sky. Galileo tried to write a program that does this on his own, but it turned out to be too slow. Can you help him?  Input Format The first line contains two integers n and m that denote the height and width of the matrix respectively. This is followed by  n lines each containing m integers each. The line following this would contain a single integer t, the number of queries to be run. Each query line consists of 4 integers px, py, qx, qy. The first two integers denote the row and column numbers of the upper left corner of the rectangular region, and the second pair of numbers correspond to the lower right corner.  Output Format For each query output a single line containing the number of stars in that rectangular region.  Example Input:  3 3 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 3 3 2 1 3 3 3 1 3 3   Output:  10 90 60 30

Given two times when seen on a digital clock, count the number of moments between these two times (both start and end time included) when the time was a palindrome. A digital clock shows time in the format HH:MM:SS (hours:minutes:seconds). For example, 2:40:38 pm is represented as 14:40:38.   Input The first line contains q queries. This is followed by q lines each containing two time strings, t1 and t2, which are 6 digit integers that represent times shown by a digital clock. It is ensured that t1 and t2 are valid times.   Output  Each output on a new line.     Constraints  1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5 t1 and t2 are of the form HH:MM:SS t1 occurs on or before t2     Example Input: 4 00:00:01 00:00:01 09:09:09 13:34:57 11:11:11 11:11:11 02:38:15 03:01:16  Output: 0 22 1 3    Explanation Case 1: Only 1 moment is considered in this case, i.e., 00:00:01. We can clearly see that 00:00:01 is not a palindromic string. Case 4: Between 02:38:15 and 03:01:16, there are 3 moments that are palindromic strings. They are 02:44:20, 02:55:20 and 03:00:30.   Note that the time as seen on a digital clock should appear as a palindrome. 1 is a palindrome, but 00:00:01 on a digital clock is not.

POINTS - 40 Harsh’s brother gifted him a big pack of Parle-G, but it’s too much for him. He doesn’t want to eat them all so to decide which out of them he will eat, he came up with an interesting way. Harsh arranges n biscuits in a line, placing each piece vertically upright like dominoes. In the beginning, he simultaneously pushes some of the biscuits either to the left or to the right.  After each second, each domino that is falling to the left pushes the adjacent biscuit on the left. Similarly, the biscuits falling to the right push their adjacent biscuits standing on the right. When a vertical biscuit has biscuits falling on it from both sides, it stays still due to the balance of the forces. The figure shows one possible example of the process.  Finally in the end, Harsh will eat all those biscuits that are left standing. Given the initial directions Harsh has pushed the biscuits, find the number of the biscuits he will eat. Input The first line contains a single integer n (1≤n≤400), the number of the biscuits in the line. The next line contains a character string of length n.  The i-th character of the string si is equal to •	"L", if the i-th biscuit has been pushed to the left; •	"R", if the i-th biscuit has been pushed to the right; •	".", if the  i-th biscuit has not been pushed.

The next line contains n integers, indicating the positions x1,x2, …xi,…xn of each troop (where 0 ≤ xi ≤ 100). The end-of-input is marked by a test case with D = n = −1.   Output For each test case, print a single integer indicating the minimum number of missiles needed.   Example  Input: 0 3 10 20 20 10 7 70 30 1 7 15 20 50 -1 -1   Output: 2 4  
Aman has a hardware store in Una. One day when he went down to the store room to fetch a box of nails. He found that the price tag had faded out. The first and the last digits of the price were not readable. Although, the number of nails in the box could be read clearly. The box read, 72 nails, Rs. _679_  What were the two faded digits, and what was the price of one nail?  Aman’s friend Arnab has great knowledge of computer programming. So Aman approached him.  He wants him write a program that solves the general version of the above problem:  N nails, Rs. _XYZ_  The total number of nails, N, is between 1 and 99, including both. The total price originally consisted of five digits, but we can see only the three digits in the middle. We assume that the first digit is nonzero, that the price of one nail is an integer number of rupees, and that all the nails cost the same price. Given N, X, Y, and Z, write a program that guesses the two faded digits and the original price. In case that there is more than one candidate for the original price, the output should be the most expensive one. That is, the program is to report the two faded digits and the maximum price per nail for the nails    Input The input consists of T test cases. The number of test cases ( T ) is given on the first line of the input file. The first line of each test case contains an integer N (0 < N < 100), which represents the number of nails. In the following line, there are the three decimal digits X, Y, and Z, separated by a space, of the original price $_XYZ_.  Output For each test case, your program has to do the following. For a test case, there may be more than one candidate for the original price or there is none. In the latter case your program is to report 0. therwise, if there is more than one candidate for the original price, the program is to report the two faded digits and the maximum price per turkey for the turkeys. The following shows sample input and output for three test cases.   Example  Input: 3 72 6 7 9 5 2 3 7 78 0 0 5   Output: 3 2 511 9 5 18475 0  
  You work at the prestigious atom-synthesis lab of DTU. You have been asked to make a new compound with N atoms and N+1 bonds, as according to a new theory these type of compounds are supposed to be more stable. However you are interested in synthesizing only the most stable compound.You may assume that an atom can bond to any number of other atoms.Also an atom may bond to itself. The stability of the compound is defined as the number of atoms in the shortest cycle in bond structure of the compound. Given N find the stability of the most stable compound that can be formed. Since the answer can be large output the answer modulo 1000000007    Input The first line contains an integer denoting the number of test cases , T. Each of the following T lines will contain an integer N indicating the number of atoms.  Output For every test case output the maximum stability that can be achieved modulo 1000000007.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^18     Example Input: 2 1 2  Output: 1 2    Explanation Example case 1. If there is only one atom, the atom may form two bonds with itself. In that case the stability will be 1 Example case 2. If there are two atoms, the atoms may form triple bonds between them. In that case the stability will be 2

Now you sell broomsticks of various lengths. You initially do not have any brooms.You decide to roam about in the city finding brooms and selling them. During each of the n days of your work as a brooms seller one of the following two events will happen:  1) You may find a broom of length L.You may or may not keep it.  2) You may have a customer ask for a broom of length L.You sell broomsticks by the length.Hence if you have the required broom of length L you can sell it in L rupees. The only problem is that you have a bad memory hence cant remember the sizes of more than 1 broom hence you never keep more than 1 broom with yourself. Now if you are given the events of those n days in advance, write a program to figure out the maximum amount you can earn..    Input The first line contains an integer n denoting the number of days.Each of the next n lines contain the description of the event on the particular day. If you find a broom of length L it contains "found" followed by a blank space and then the integer L.If you have a customer demanding broom of length L then it contains "demand" followed by a blank space and then the integer L..  Output Output the maximum amount of money that you can earn in rupees if you know the input schedule of events in advance.  Constraints  1 ≤ n ≤ 10000 1 ≤ L ≤ 100000     Example Input: 4 found 3 found 4 demand 3 demand 4  Output: 4    Explanation If you choose to keep the broom of length 4 and sell it you can make a profit of Rupees 4 which is also the maximum profit that can be made 
Crazy Boy had a tough Math exam in school today. On returning home, he realizes that he made a crucial error in the paper. In all the problems which involved calculating the determinant of a matrix, he forgot to multiply the minors with the sign term (-1)^(i + j), which resulted in wrong cofactors, and thus the wrong determinant. On further thought, he finds this slight error quite interesting and decides to calculate this new value obtained by skipping the sign term, for arbitrary matrices. Write a program that calculates it for him and makes his task easier.  Input The first line contains an integer N, the size of the square matrix. Lines 2 to N+1 contain N space separated integers each, denoting the values A[i][j] (j'th number in the i'th row)  Output Output the result modulo 10^9+7.  Constraints 1 <= N <= 20 -10^9 <= A[i][j] <= 10^9  Example Input: 22 -3-8 -1 Output: 22Input3 1 2 34 0 6-1 2 8Output88

A string X is a multiple of string Y if X consists of one or more copies of Y concatenated together. For e.g. 'abab' and 'ab' are multiples of 'ab'. Crazy Girl is interested in some specific properties of strings and needs to find multiples of a smaller string in a bigger string, but it is getting too cumbersome to do for large texts. Given two strings B and A, she wants to find all the substrings of string A which are multiples of string B and cannot be extended further to the left or right and are of maximal length. Help her by writing a program to automate the task. Output the location of the multiples of string B in the form of pairs (a, b) where a denotes the starting position of the multiple in string A (1 - based) and b denotes the number of times string B is repeated in the multiple.  Input The first line contains the string A and the second line contains the string B.  Output Output the required pairs (a, b) in decreasing order of a and output -1 if string B is not a substring of string A.  Constraints 1 <= |A| <= 10^6 1 <= |B| <= |A|  The strings A and B consist only of lowercase letters 'a' - 'z'  Example Input: aabaabaaabaaaba Output: 4 21 1Explanation:The pairs (8, 1) and (4, 1) are not reported because they can be extended further to the left and right respectively to form a multiple with two copies of string B. 
  There are a lot of hills on the surface of Mars, and you have information about the heights of N of those hills located one after the other. Your supervisor is now interested in finding the number of distinct heights of hills in arbitrary ranges. Your task is to answer his queries.   Input  The first line contains an integer N, the number of hills. The next line contains N integers, denoting the heights of the hills. The hills are numbered from 1 to N and the i^th integer ai denotes the height of the i^th hill. The next line contains an integer Q, the number of queries to answer. The next Q lines contain two integers each, xi and ri, where ri denotes the ending location of the range of hills for the i^th query. Let Qi be the answer to the i^th query, then the value of li+1, the starting location of the range of hills for the next query, is obtained by adding xi+1 to Qi. Q0 = 0 li = xi +  Qi-1 (for i ≥ 1)   Output  Output Q integers, where the i^th integer denotes the answer of the i^th query, i.e. number of distinct heights among the hills in range [li, ri].

 Crazy Bob came across a set of n transformers that are all faulty. Crazy bob decided to fix it in a crazy way. The n transformers are of 2 types. The first  kind can be fixed in a single attempt with probability A% and the second kind can be fixed in a single attempt with probability B%. You are given a string composed of characters 'A' and 'B' to denote which type of transformers each one is.  As always, Bob wants to show off his transformer fixing skills in a crazy way. While atleast one of the transformer is mal-functioning, he randomly chooses a set of k transformers and attempts to fix all of them. The transformers that are already working (in the set of chosen k) remain working. Of the chosen transformers that are still mal-functioning, the transformers that are of type A get fixed with probability A% and the transformers of type B get fixed with probability B%.  You are asked to find the expected number of steps Bob takes to fix all the transformers. One step is a selection of k random transformers from n.   Input  The first line of the input consists of the number of testcases T (T ≤ 200). Each of the test case starts with 4 integers n, k, A, B which denote the number of transformers to be repaired, the number k crazy-bob chooses at each iteration. A and B are the probabilities in percent. Constraints: 1 ≤ n ≤ 40, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, 1 ≤ A ≤ 99, 1 ≤ B ≤ 99,   Output  Output one number for each line - the expected number of iterations crazy-bob needs to perform before all the transformers are repaired. Your answer will be considered correct if the absolute difference between your number and the correct number is Example   Input: 4 2 1 99 99 AA 1 1 99 99 A 2 1 40 60 AB 2 1 100 100 AA  Output: 3.0303030303 1.0101010101 6.3333333333 3.0000000000  Explanation:  In the third test case, Bob randomly chooses one of the transformers (with 1/2 probability each) and fixes them. Thus he is left with fixing 1 transformer. Let x be the expected number of moves before he can fix the 1 transformer. So the answer is 1+x. To calculate x, at the next step, he  randomly chooses any  of the transformers (with 1/2 each). If he chooses the fixed  transformer, he has wasted the move and is back to x. If he chooses the faulty one, he has fixed both the transformers. Hence x = 1+1/2(x) or x = 2. The required answer is 1+x = 3. 
There are N cells in a circle numbered 1 to N in that order. Cell i is adjacent to cells (i-1) and (i+1) and cells 1 and N are also adjacent. You can cut the circle between two indices and you have to make two such cuts so that the circle breaks in to two arcs, with each cell in one of them. Each arc should have at least one cell in it. Given a circular array of N cells, find the number of ways in which you can break it in to two arcs such that sum of values in the cells in the two arcs are same.

 Congratulations!!! You have been selected as a contestant on the show, Programmer's Jackpot tonight. For one of the rounds in the show, you face a problem as defined below :  "For any positive integer 'X' , the sum of digits called as digit-sum of 'X', is defined as the sum of 'X' itself and its digits. When 'Y' is the digitsum of 'X' , we call 'X' a encore of 'Y'. For example, the digit-sum of 245 is 256 (= 245 + 2 + 4 + 5). Therefore, 245 is a encore of 256. But there are some numbers which do not have any encores, and some numbers have more than one encore. For example, the encores of 216 are 198 and 207."  Your task for this round is to write a program to find the smallest encore of the given integer.   Input  Your first line of input consists of 'K' (1 ≤ K ≤ 50) test cases. The number of test cases 'K' is given in the first line of the input followed by a blank line. Each test case takes one line containing an integer N , (20 ≤ N ≤ 100,000).   Output  The output of your program will print exactly one line for each test case. The line is to contain a encore of N for each test case. If X has multiple encores, print the smallest. If X does not have any encores, print "NONE". The following shows sample input and output for three test cases.   Sample Input: 3  216 121 2005  Sample Output: 198 NONE 1979 
 Everyone knows that electricity travels faster than anything. But we can delay an electric signal if we can make it pass through a grid of dense and resistive wires. So, this is your objective in this problem. You are given a square grid consisting of numbers. The numbers in the grid are the seconds by which an electric signal can be delayed if it is made to pass through that particular block in the grid (Be careful...Some blocks can actually increase the speed of the grid!!). You can reflect the electric signal from one block to only 3 other blocks as follows:1. to the block immediately below.2. to the block diagonally below left. (i.e. one down and one left)3. to the block diagonally below right. (i.e. one down and one right) What you need to do is to find the maximum delay that can be introduced in the electric signal. The constraints are that the signal can start at any block belonging only to the top row. And can end at any block only at the bottom row.   Input  The first line contains the number of test-cases followed by a blank line. The test cases won't exceed 50 neither would be less than 1. The first line of each input begins with the dimension of the grid. From the next line, the actual grid is provided as an input, the blocks in a row separated by a space and the new row on the new-line. There is a blank line between two consecutive inputs. Consider all the inputs as Integers (in accordance with the "int" in C language on a 32-bit system).   Output  The delays introduced in the electric signal for each input should be printed on a new-line.   Sample Input: 1  3 2 3 1 4 5 6 -1 -2 5  Sample Output: 14

 Two employees of a multinational company plan a conspiracy against the management . The major problem in their plans to take place is regular and secret communication. One of them comes up with a common but insecure method of encrypting text .What he does is to permute the letters of the alphabet. In other words, each letter of the alphabet is consistently replaced in the text by some other letter. To ensure that the encryption is reversible, no two letters are replaced by the same letter.You have been appointed by management to decrypt several encoded lines of text, assuming that each line uses a different set of replacements, and that all words in the decrypted text are from a dictionary of known words.   Input  The first line of the input consists of the number of test cases (within 1 and 50) followed by a blank line. The test case consists of a line containing an integer 'n', followed by 'n' UPPERCASE words, one per line, in alphabetical order. These 'n' words compose the dictionary of words which may appear in the decrypted text. Following the dictionary is the input text. There are no more than 1,000 words in the dictionary. No word exceeds 16 letters. The encrypted lines contain only UPPERCASE letters and spaces and do not exceed 80 characters in length. Finally every test case is separated by a blank line.   Output  Decrypt each line and print it to standard output. If there are multiple solutions, any one will do. If there is no solution, replace every letter of the alphabet by an asterisk.

 Crick and Watson was the duo who discovered the Double Helix model of the DNA with its "AT GC" pairing. Now while they were working on their project, they came across an intriguiging problem. The problem was that they found many combinations of the "AT"s and "GC"s in the DNA of the same organism. To their relief, this list was exhaustive. And now, they are stuck with the problem to construct the complete DNA of the organism from the combinations that they found. The problem is that, the combinations that they found ARE be a proper subset of the master DNA Model. So now, your job is to help the legendary duo in constructing the master DNA of the organism from the given combinations. The constraint being that the length of the master DNA model should be minimum.   Input  The first line of the input would consist of the number of test cases (within 1 and 20) followed by a blank line. The first line of each test case would consist of the number of "ATGC" Combination strings (not exceeding 20 and atleast 2) followed by the combination strings on each newline. Finally, there is a blank line between each two consecutive test cases. Consider that all the string input is in UPPERCASE. The input is in the priority order i.e. the importance order of the combination strings. Consider the order of importance of the combination string input ONLY if you get two master DNA strings of the same length.    Output  For the output, the master DNA model for each test case is expected on a newline. The output is also expected in UPPERCASE only.

In “Blackjack”, a popular card game, the goal is to have cards which sum up to largest number not exceeding 21. John came up with his own version of this game. In John's game, cards have positive integers written on them. The player is given a set of cards and an integer M. He must choose three cards from this set so that their sum comes as close as possible to M without exceeding it. This is not always easy since there can be a hundred of cards in the given set.  Help John by writing a program that finds the best possible outcome of given game.  Input The first line of input contains an integer N (3 ≤ N ≤ 100), the number of cards, and M (10 ≤ M ≤300 000), the number that we must not exceed.  The following line contains numbers written on John's cards: N distinct space-separated positive integers less than 100 000.  There will always exist some three cards whose sum is not greater than M.  Output The first and only line of output should contain the largest possible sum we can obtain.  Example  Input: 5 21 5 6 7 8 9  Output: 21  Input: 10 500 93 181 245 214 315 36 185 138 216 295  Output: 497 
I guess the most visited site of the past 3 months is www.cricinfo.com. First World Cup Cricket, then Australia tour to Bangladesh and now IPL T20. I believe there are lots of cricket fans among you. So I do not need to describe the game rule. But for the purpose of this problem here is short description of scoring. Any rule out of this problem description is not applicable for this problem. For this problem we will use only the following outcomes in a ball:   .cricinfotable td {    border: 1px solid #000;    padding:3px; }   Possible Outcome in a Ball Runs Is the Ball valid?   . (dot) 0 Yes   1 1 Yes   2 2 Yes   3 3 Yes   4 4 Yes   6 6 Yes   Wd 1 No   1Wd 2 No   2Wd 3 No   4Wd 5 No   Nb 1 No   1Nb 2 No   4Nb 5 No   6Nb 7 No   W 0 Yes    (Wd stands for Wide, Nb for No Ball and W for Wicket)  In cricinfo we always watch the score card. In cricket an over consists of 6 valid balls. A score card of an over may look like below:   1 . W . Wd Nb . 6   In this over there were 1 wicket and 9 runs. In the last over of second innings of a match, a team requires N runs to win. You are to output number of ways of the outcome of the over. Note that, as you are watching second innings of the match, so it may be possible that he can score N runs in first 4 balls and win the match. That means, it is not necessary to play an entire over to score N runs. Also suppose you do not know how many wickets are already gone. So it may also be possible that after a few wicket falls they are all out. Also note that, if a team scores greater or equal to N runs the team wins and does not play any ball.  Input First line contains number of test case T (T <= 10000). For each test a line contains N (1 <= N <= 10000).  Output For every test case, output the case number and number of ways of outcome of the last over where the team needs N runs to win. As the answer can be very big, so output in mod 10000007.  Example  Input: 1 1  Output: Case 1: 946

Sak and Pre are the two little sisters :) They love to play games with each other. Yesterday, Pre was stumbling online and she came across a new game called “Stone-Queen”. She immediately told about it to Sak, so she could play it with her. Stone-Queen is a two player game. The game starts with a pile of stones. Each player on his turn can subtract a “queen” number of stones from the pile and the subtracted stones are discarded from the game. A queen number is defined as a number which is either a prime or it has exactly two distinct prime factors. The loser is the player who cannot make a move. Sak is very intelligent, she figured out the winning strategy after a number of plays. But Pre is not able to figure out the winning strategy and so she is losing every time. Can you help Pre find out who wins the game given the initial number of stones N in the pile? Assume that both players play optimally    Input First line contains T, the number of test cases. Next T lines contains T test cases, each of which is in the form of first_player N”, where first_player stands for the player who starts the game and N represents the number of stones in pile initially.    Output Output T lines, each containing the name of player who wins the game.   Constraints 1 ≤ N ≤ 100000 1 ≤ T ≤ 10000    Example  Input: 3 Sak 3 Pre 1 Pre 4   Output: Sak Sak Pre  
 Turtur has started preparation for All Champions Mathematics Contest going to be held in Feb. this year. Although he is very good at mathematics, but his weakest among all topics is Number Theory. So he has been studying various Number Theory problems from past few days. He came across one of the problems called Excessivity of a number problem. Excessivity of a number is defined as the product of Summation excess function of every prime below or equal to that number. Summation excess function for a prime number is defined as sum of Excess function of all positive powers till power K of that prime number. Excess function of a number is defined as the sum of all divisors of that number (including 1 and itself) minus that number itself.  Excess(x) = sum of divisors of "x" – x. SummationExcess(P,K) = Excessivity(N,K) =  Turtur has found a very nice solution for this problem for some values of N & K. But since he is weak in Number Theory, he is unsure of his results and he wants to crosscheck his answers for given values of N & K. Since this result can be pretty large, just tell him the Excessivity(N,K) modulo 10^9+7.    Input First line consists of T the number of test cases. Each of the next T lines contains two integers N and K.    Output Output T lines each containing the Excessivity(N,K) modulo 10^9+7.   Constraints  1<=N<=10^6 1<=K<=10^9 1<=T<=10  Example  Input: 2 2 3 5 2  Output: 11 140 
City of Romini is one of the well planned cities of the world. Why? Because road network at Romini is great. The roads in Romini are built in a grid like fashion. Some roads in Romini have stall-walls from which people cannot pass through. One such arrangement of Romini grid road network is given in a figure below   The above network has 5 east to west roads and 3 north to south roads. “#” represents stall-walls. Stall-walls are only present at the intersection point of any two roads.  Nooji is spending her holiday in City of Romini. She was amazed by the transport system of Romini. They have a very weird rule of charging fare from commuters. For a travelling distance of any units in either a horizontal direction or a vertical direction, without a stall-wall in between source and destination, they charge 1 Rupa. So suppose Nooji wants to travel from S to D2 in above grid network system, she will only have to pay 1 Rupa. But if she wants to travel between S and D1, she will be charged 3 Rupa because she cannot commute through stall-wall and so she will have to go south first one unit (and pay 1 Rupa for it), then travel 3 units east (and pay 1 Rupa for it) and then finally travel 1 unit north to reach D1 (and pay 1 Rupa for it). So in total she will have to pay 3 Rupa.  She is so confused with this system! Being a travel planner for her, can you plan her travel between given source and destination so that she has to pay minimum?    Note  If Nooji cannot reach destination from source, print 0 as answer.   Input First line contains T, the no. of test cases. Each test case starts with two integers M and N in the first line, the dimensions of grid road network. Next line contains the integer coordinates of source for Nooji. Next line contains integer coordinates of destination for Nooji. Next M lines contain N characters in each line, the description of Grid road network. Note that all coordinates are 0 indexed based.   Output Output T lines each containing the minimum amount Nooji will have to pay for travelling.   Constraints  N<=100 M<=100 T<=100  Example  Input: 2 4 4 1 1 2 2 .... ..#. .#.. .... 3 5 1 2 0 4 ..##. ...#. .....   Output: 4 3 
 Silly is the chief of the secret department that works on Encryption techniques. YooTi works under Silly in that department. Silly is working on a new project. The project often requires the Exclusive-OR maximum to be found out on a set of integers with respect to another given integer called the query integer. So every time a query integer comes up to Silly, he asks YooTi to find out the Max (Ai xor B) where Ai is an integer from the set A and B is the query integer. YooTi is frustrated now because Silly gives too many query integers and she has to search out the whole set to find the answer. Can you help YooTi with this?   Input  First line contains N, the number of integers the set A. Next line contains N space separated positive integers. The value of each integer will not exceed 1000000. Next line contains Q, the number of query integers. Next Q lines contain the query integers B, one per line.    Output Output  Q lines 'corresponding to each query containing a single integer, the max(B xor A1, B xor A2,.......,B xor An).  Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 100000 1 ≤ Q ≤ 10000 1 ≤ Ai ,B ≤ 1000000    Example  Input: 5 5 8 12 20 18 4 1 10 20 16  Output: 21 30 28 28  
The legendary Sherlock Holmes needs your help in solving a case. He has been trying to solve the case of The Lost Number for a long time and using his exceptional skills, has been able to discover all N parts of the number. He also knows that the Lost Number is the arrangement of these N parts, that results in the numerically maximum number. Since he is very busy with other cases, he needs you to use your coding skills to  help him find The Lost Number. Given N numbers K1 K2 K3…Kn, output the biggest number that can be formed by joining these N numbers.  Input First line of the input contains the number of test cases T. For each test case there are 2 lines of input- The first line contains an integer N. The second line contains N space separated numbers Ki.  Output For each test case output a single line containing the maximum number that can be formed.  Constraints 1<=T<=20 1<=N<=100 1<=K [i]<=10^18  Example  Input: 3 3 4 1 8 2 231 942 2 59 542  Output: 841 942231 59542  Explanation for the second test case: 231 and 942 can have 2 possible arrangements 231942 and 942231. Since 942231>231942, the correct answer is 942231. 
Irene Adler is furious with Sherlock Holmes, as he is always busy with his work. So Sherlock decides to impress his lady love by buying her some gifts. He knows that he will have to buy at least K gifts. Miser that he is, he decides to go to the gift shop, and buy the cheapest K gifts available. The shopkeeper on seeing the famous detective enter his shop, decides to test his intelligence. He organizes all the gifts in the shop in N lines, each line having M gifts. To further add to Sherlock’s misery, he encloses the gifts in each row in a transparent tube, and tells him that the gifts are accessible only from the ends i.e. he can only pick a gift only if there is no gift to its right or to its left. He asks Sherlock to pick one gift at a time and challenges him to minimize the total cost of the K gifts. Sherlock, happy to have a challenge even in this boring task of buying gifts, accepts his challenge happily. Now he needs your help to pass the shopkeeper’s challenge and save some money. Given the cost of each gift in the N*M grid, find the minimum cost in which he can buy at least K gifts.  Input The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains 3 integers N,M and K. The next N lines contain M integer each, the cost of the items.  Constraints 1<=T<=5 1<=N<=100 1<=M<=1000 1<=K<=1000 1<=C<=100000  Output For each test case output a single line containing the minimum cost of K gifts.  Example  Input: 2 2 2 3 6 3 1 9 2 4 5 2 1 10 5 20 1 50 1  Output: 10 19 
Sherlock Holmes was trying to solve another murder case. He found a box that can be unlocked only by forming a pattern on it. Box has a matrix of LEDs of N x M on the top and K switches which can toggle some LEDs on the box. Sherlock Holmes being very smart already knew the pattern that has to be formed using the LEDs to unlock the box. He found this task a bit tedious so asks you for help. Given the size of the matrix (N x M), list of K switches and with each switch a list of position(x,y) of LEDs (0 based index) that will be toggled on turning on that particular switch, you need to tell whether pattern can be formed or not  Input First line of input contains no. of test cases T. And first line of each testcase contains N,M (the size of the matrix) and K (the no. of switches). Then K lines follow, first integer of each line is P (no. of LEDs it can toggle) and then follow 2*P integers denoting the x and y coordinates of the LED (like x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3 …..xp yp) Then follows the N X M matrix representing the final pattern. Each cell of the matrix will be either 1(ON) or 0(OFF)  Output Output of each test case will be a line containing “Yes” or “No” (quotes for clarity), “Yes” if the pattern can be formed “No” if it cannot be.  Constraints 1<=T<=100 1<=N,M<=20 1<=K<400 Note: All the LEDs are off initially  Example  Input: 1 5 5 4 4 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 8 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 2 1 2 2 2 3 2 4 8 2 1 2 2 2 3 2 4 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 4 3 1 3 2 3 3 3 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0  Output: Yes 
James Moriarty planted few bombs all over the city. But sadly there is only one bomb defusing squad, and is at a fixed position (X,Y). Sherlock Holmes was able to find out the positions of all the bombs. So all the bombs are to be disarmed in order to save the city. Since this is a very dangerous task thus no body volunteered. Sherlock is initially at position (X,Y) and can carry only one bomb at a time.  He has to bring all the bombs to the bomb defusing squad. Obviously he wants to do this task as soon as possible. Given the position of the Squad and position of all the bombs, you need to tell the minimum distance that Sherlock Holmes has to travel to save the city.  Input First line contains test cases T<=400. Then first line of each test case tells the no. of bombs N ( 3<=N <=1500) in the city. Next line contain the position of squad X Y ( X,Y <=100). Next N lines denotes the position of bombs- xi yi (xi,yi<=100).  Output For each test case output the minimum distance that Sherlock Holmes will travel.  Note: Bomb Squad is fixed and can not move. Initially Sherlock Holmes is standing with the squad. All the positions are integers. Minimum Distance between two points x1 y1 and x2 y2 is | x1-x2 | + | y1-y2 |.  Example  Input: 1 3 3 4 5 6 2 1 2 3  Output: 20 
Sherlock Holmes is chasing a cab driver and he(Holmes) is carrying a gun with which he can shoot the . cabbie. Both Sherlock Holmes and the cab driver are initially in the first cell (1,1) and the Jail is at (N,M). Sherlock Holmes will shoot the cab exactly one time whenever they both are in same cell i.e. whenever they are in the same cell, the strength of the car reduces by 1. The cabdriver’s car has strength equal to K i.e. after exactly K shots car will break down. So in order to save the pain of taking the cab driver to the police, he decided to break down his car at (N,M) i.e. he will take his last shot at (N,M). The size of the grid is N x M and none of them can go out of the grid. Also both the cab driver and Sherlock can either go to the left or down (i.e if one is at (x,y) then he can either go to (x+1,y) or to (x,y+1) ). Both Sherlock Holmes and the cab driver are travelling at the same speed. Given the size of the grid and the strength of the car, you need to tell the no. of ways Sherlock could have stopped the cabbie. Note: They are always together in the first and last cell. Two ways are different if path taken by at least one of them different in both ways.  Input First line of input contains T, the no. of testcases. Each test case contains one line containing 3 integers N M and K separated by a space.  Output Output of each test case is a single integer denoting the no. ways. Since this number can be very large, output the number after taking mod with 1,000,000,007 (10^9 +7)  Constraints 1<=T<=1000 1<=N,M<=50 0<=K<=100  Example  Input: 5 2 1 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 Output: 1 0 2 2 12 
  Your friend has recently started playing Battlefield, and is very impressed by the dynamics of the game. However, he's still a noob.  One of the things that he's struggling with is the bullet drop over long distances, while shooting with sniper rifles. You decide to help him out by creating an overlay game mod, which tells him exactly how far up to aim in his reticle to account for the bullet drop over various distances.  The drop is not noticeable till a distance of 100 meters, and after that the bullet drops 0.1 centimeters for every 20 meters. Given x, the distance between your friend and the enemy camper, output y, the deviation due to the bullet drop.   Input  The first line of the input contains an integer N, denoting the number of instances of the problem to solve. The next N integers denote x, the distance in meters.   Output  For each of the N instances, output y, the bullet drop in centimeters. y should have an absolute or relative error of less than 10^-6.   Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤  10^6 1 ≤ x ≤  10^8   Example  Input: 5 100 120 140 200 103  Output: 0.000000 0.100000 0.200000 0.500000 0.015000  
  Given a string, your task is to encrypt it. The encryption should be done using the following algorithm:  First, Swap the two halves of the given string.  If the string is of odd length, the character in the middle remains at its position. For example, the string "abcde" is converted to "decab", and the string "abcd" is converted to "cdab".  Then, for each character x of the resultant string, perform the following operations  Find the positional value of the character x. Let the positional value of x be p.  The positional value is the position in which the character appears in the English alphabetical sequence. For example, the positional value of "a" is 1, "b" is 2, "c" is 3 and so on. c. The character x is to be replaced by (p%10).f((p/10)+1), where "." has been used as a concatenation operator and function f(n) returns the nth position alphabet.   You may assume that the characters in the given string would only include lower case English alphabets.    Input The first line of input would consist of T, the number of test cases. T lines follow each consisting of a string that is to be encrypted.    Output For each test case output the corresponding encrypted text.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 1000     Example Input: 2 geucoders codechef  Output: 4a5a8b9b5b7a5a1c3a 3a8a5a6a3a5b4a5a   
Problem Statement Burnout, a popular gaming arena in Manipal, has come up with new charging schemes for all the students that game there. Since there are different types of gamers, they are always seeking for packages that are best suited for them. To have an edge over their newly arising competitors, Burnout provides various packages. Two of the most popular packages are:   Respawn Frag  Respawn charges every 30 minutes at a rate of Rs.10. That means if you play for 29 minutes or less, you will be charged with Rs.10. If you play for 30 to 59 minutes, you will be charged with Rs.20 and so on. Frag charges every 60 minutes at a rate of Rs.15. That means if you play for 59 minutes or less, you will be charged with Rs.15. Similarly, if you play for 60 minutes to 119 minutes, you will be charged with Rs.30 and so on. Given a list of durations that students have played for, can you determine the package that is cheaper?     Input The first line of input is an integer T, denoting the total number of test cases. Each case starts with a line containing an integer N. followed by a list of N durations (In minutes) in next line. Each duration is an integer in the range [1, 2000] which will be separated by a single space character.  Output For each case, output the case number first. Then output the name of the cheaper package followed by the corresponding cost in Rupees. If both package gives the same total cost, then output both the names (Respawn preceding Frag) followed by the cost. Look at the output and sample input for details.

Problem Statement   You are walking on the streets of New York when the famous illusionist David Blaine comes up to you. He is holding an ordered deck of 10 cards numbered 1 to 10 with card 1 at the top and card 10 at the bottom. He gives the pack of cards to you. He asks you to throw away the top card and move the card that is now on the top of the deck to the bottom of the deck and to keep doing this as long as there are at least two cards in the deck. When you are left with the last card in your hand he takes a minute and then says 4. To your amazement when you turn the card over, it is 4. How does he do it? Write a program to predict the last card when there are n cards in the ordered deck.   Input Each line of input (except the last) contains a positive number n. The last line contains 0 denoting the end inputs.  Output . For each number from input produce one line of output giving the last remaining card.  Constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000    Example Input: 8 15 23 9 0   Output: 8 14 14 2     Note : The reference for this problem has been taken from : UVa online Judge  
On a wonderful rainy day, a little champ was wandering in the street. He was so sad because he had no power to fight against the monster, meanwhile there was a magical rain with power-boosters, the value of each power booster is a positive number. The product of power boosters is a constant. Let us consider a1, a2, a3…..,an are the powers of the power-boosters a1*a2*a3….. *an =k.

 Bruce the miner works as a slave in a diamond mine, and now the mine is starting to fall apart. After helping his friends evacuate the mine, he thinks it is the perfect time to make some profit and escape from his oppressive masters.  His plan is to re-enter the mine with the excuse of helping more people, take as much diamonds as he can and exit the mine before it falls apart without being seen. Then, he will escape far away and live peacefully in a Caribbean island with all his diamonds. However, the mine will fall apart in L minutes, so he needs help in determining the maximum number of diamonds he can take and return to the entrance before the mine falls apart.  The mine is structured as N chambers connected by N-1 corridors. Each corridor connects two different chambers and takes a specific number of minutes to be traversed. Also, it is known that there is exactly one path between each pair of chambers in the mine. The chamber 0 represents the entrance to the mine. Miner Bruce can take as much diamonds as he wants from the chamber where he is instantly.  Input  The first line contains an integer T, which specifies the number of test cases. Then, T test case descriptions will follow.  Each test case will start with a line with two positive integers, N and L, whose meanings were described previously. The next line will contain N integers Di, specifying the number of diamonds on each chamber. The next N - 1 lines will contain three integers Ai, Bi and Ci each, which indicates that the chambers Ai and Bi are connected by a corridor that takes Ci minutes to be traversed.  Output  For each input case you must print the string "Case #i: ", where i is the test case number, starting from 1, followed by the maximum number that Bruce the miner can recover without being trapped inside the mine.   Example  Input 2 5 7 7 3 7 8 6 0 1 1 0 2 1 0 3 1 0 4 1 6 25 5 8 3 3 10 7 0 1 4 3 0 3 2 3 2 5 2 3 4 5 4  Output Case #1: 28 Case #2: 28   Constraints   1 ≤ T ≤100  2 ≤ N ≤100  1 ≤ L ≤200 Ci will be between 1 and 100, inclusive, for each i between 1 and N-1, inclusive.

Problem text... Mr. G. works as a tourist guide. His current assignment is to take some tourists from one city to another. Some two-way roads connect the cities. For each pair of neighboring cities there is a bus service that runs only between those two cities and uses the road that directly connects them. Each bus service has a limit on the maximum number of passengers it can carry. Mr. G. has a map showing the cities and the roads connecting them. He also has the information regarding each bus service. He understands that it may not always be possible for him to take all the tourists to the destination city in a single trip. But Mr. G. finds it difficult to find the best route himself so that he may be able to take all the tourists to the destination city in minimum number of trips. So, he seeks your help.  Input Input description... The input will contain one or more test cases. The first line of each test case will contain two positive integers N (11) is the limit on the maximum number of passengers to be carried by the bus between the two cities. City numbers are positive integers ranging from 1 to N. 2 5 1 4 7 3 6 30 15 60 20 30 20 10 35 25 40 the (R+1)th line will contain three integers S, D and T representing respectively the starting city, the destination city and the number of tourists to be guided. The input will end with two zeroes for N and R.  Output Output description... For each test case in the input output the minimum number of trips required on a separate line.  Example  Input: 7 10 1 2 30 1 3 15 1 4 10 2 4 25 2 5 60 3 4 40 3 6 20 4 7 35 5 7 20 6 7 30 1 7 99 3 2 1 2 15 2 3 10 1 3 30 0 0  Output: 4 3  
Problem text... Many persons are familiar with the Roman numerals for relatively small numbers. The symbols i, v, x, l and c represent the decimal values 1, 5, 10, 50 and 100 respectively. To represent other values, these symbols, and multiples where necessary, are concatenated, with the smaller valued symbols written further to the right. For example, the number 3 is represented as "iii", and the value 73 is represented as "lxxiii". The exceptions to this rule occur for numbers having units values of 4 to 9, and for tens values of 40 or 90. For these cases, the Roman numerals representations are "iv" (4), "ix" (9), "xl" (40) and "xc" (90). So the Roman numeral representations for 24,39,44,49 and 94 are xxiv, xxxix, xliv, xlix and xciv respectively. The preface of many books have pages numbered with Roman numerals, starting with "i" for the first page of the preface, and continuing in sequence. Assume books with pages having 100 or fewer pages of preface. How many i, v, x, l and c characters are required to number the pages in the preface? For example, in a five page preface we'll use the Roman numerals i, ii, iii, iv and v, meaning we need 7 i characters and 2 v characters.  Input Input description... The input will consists of a sequence of integers in the range 1 to 100, terminated by a zero. For each integer, excepts the final zero, determine the number of different types of characters needed to number the prefix pages with Roman numerals  Output Output description... For each integer in the input, write one line containing the five counts in the order i, v, x, l, c.  Example  Input: 2 20 99 0  Output: 3 0 0 0 0 28 10 14 0 0 140 50 150 50 10  
Problem text... A dancing square is a “transparent” n x n matrix whose components are "painted" with a uppercase x (x) or a period (.). A dancing square dances by spinning 90 clockwise or counterclockwise, and or flipping about a centered horizontal or vertical axis When dancing squares are dancing it can be quite challenging to determine which are identically painted and which are distinct. Write a program which inputs an original dancing square, then inputs one or more additional dancing squares and determines for each one if it is identical- i.e. can be obtained from original by some sequence of spin and/or flips, or is distinct- i.e. cannot be obtained from the original by sequence of spins and/or flips.  Input Input description... The first line of standard input contains the dimension n>=1 of all dancing squares which follow. The subsequent lines of input contain at least two dancing squares, each preceded by blank line and consisting of n lines containing n component characters.  Output Output description... For each dancing square in the standard input following the first one, output a line containing "identical" or "distinct", indicating whether it is identical to or distinct from the first one.  Example  Input: 3 x.x x.. xx. xxx ..x x.. xxx .. x x. x  Output: Square 2 is identical to square 1. Square 3 is distinct from square 1. 
 Multiplication of natural numbers in general is a cumbersome operation. In some cases however the product can be obtained by moving the last digit to the front.  Example: 179487 * 4 = 717948  Of course this property depends on the numbersystem you use, in the above example we used the decimal representation. In base 9 we have a shorter example:  17 * 4 = 71 (base 9)  as (9 + 7) * 4 = 7 * 9 +1  Input Input description... The input for your program is a textfile. Each line consists of three numbers separated by a space: the base of the number system, the least significant digit of the first factor, and the second factor. This second factor is one digit only hence less than the base. The input file ends with the standard end-of-file marker.  Output Output description... Your program determines for each input line the number of digits of the smallest first factor with the rotamultproperty. The output-file is also a textfile. Each line contains the answer for the corresponding input line.  Example  Input: 10 7 4 9 7 4 17 14 12  Output: 6 2 4  
You have been selected to write the navigation module for Bot. Unfortunately, the mechanical engineers have not provided a lot of flexibility in movement; indeed, the PropBot can only make two distinct movements. It can either move 10 cm forward, or turn towards the right by 45 degrees. Each of these individual movements takes one second of time.  Input  Your module has two inputs: the Cartesian coordinates of a point on the plane that the PropBot wants to get as close to as possible, and the maximum number of seconds that can be used to do this. At the beginning of the navigation, the robot is located at the origin, pointed in the +x direction. The number of seconds will be an integer between 0 and 24, inclusive. Both the x and y coordinates of the desired destination point will be a real number between -100 and 100, inclusive. The first entry in the input file will be the number of test cases, t (0 < t < 100). Following this line will be t lines, with each line containing three entries separated by spaces. The first entry will be the number of seconds PropBot has to get close to the point. The second entry is the x-coordinate of the point, and the third entry is the y-coordinate of the point.  Output Your program must return the distance between the goal point and the closest point the robot can get to within the given time. Your result should include at least one digit to the left of the decimal point, and exactly six digits to the right of the decimal point. To eliminate the chance of round off error affecting the results, we have constructed the test data so the seventh digit to the right of the decimal point of the true result is never a 4 or a 5.  Example  Input: 2 24 5.0 5.0 9 7.0 17.0   Output: 0.502525 0.100505 
For the purposes of this problem, we will assume that every page in an book is numbered sequentially, and that the first page is numbered 1. How many digits would you need to use to number the pages of a 10 page book? Pages 1 to 9 would require 1 digit each (total 9), and page 10 would require 2 digits. This makes 11 digits. Similarly, a book of 34 pages would require 59 digits. Can we work backwards? If you are told that a book requires 13 digits to number its pages, can you work out how many pages the book has? I hope so, because that is all you have to do for this problem. Each line in the input file represents the number of digits used in numbering a book. Your answer will be the number of pages the book has. If the number supplied cannot possibly be valid, your answer should be "Impossible!" Beware that books can be quite large, and the number of digits required for a given book can reach 2,000,000,000.    Input Each line in the input file contains a single integer, between 1 and 2,000,000,000, representing a number of digits used in numbering the pages of a book. A single # on a line indicates the end of input.   Output Output for each input number must be on a single line. If the input value is valid, output the number of pages in the book. Otherwise, output "Impossible!"   Example  Input: 11 13 59 60 1999999998 #   Output: 10 11 34 Impossible! 234567900   
--I just bought Leonardo's secret notebook! Rare object collector Stan Ucker was really agitated but his friend, special investigator Sarah Kepticwas unimpressed. --How do you know it is genuine? -- Oh, it must be, at that price. And it is written in the da Vinci code. Sarah browsed a few of the pages. It was obvious to her that the code was a substitution cipher, where each letter of the alphabet had been substituted by another letter. --Leonardo would have written the plain-text and left it to his assistant to encrypt, she said. And he must have supplied the substitution alphabet to be used. If we are lucky, we can find it on the back cover! She turned up the last page and, lo and behold, there was a single line of all 26 letters of the alphabet: QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJKLZXCVBNM -- This may be Leonardo's instructions meaning that each A in the plain-text was to be replaced by Q, each B withW, etcetera. Let us see... To their disappointment, they soon saw that this could not be the substitution that was used in the book. Suddenly, Stan brightened. -- Maybe Leonardo really wrote the substitution alphabet on the last page, and by mistake his assistant coded that line as he had coded the rest of the book. So the line we have here is the result of applying some permutation TWICE to the ordinary alphabet! Sarah took out her laptop computer and coded fiercely for a few minutes. Then she turned to Stan with a sympathetic expression. -- No, that couldn't be it. I am afraid that you have been duped again, my friend. In all probability, the book is a fake. Write a program that takes a permutation of the English alphabet as input and decides if it may be the result of performing some permutation twice.  Input The input begins with a positive number on a line of its own telling the number of test cases (at most 500). Then for each test case there is one line containing a permutation of the 26 capital letters of the English alphabet.   Output For each test case, output one line containing Yes if the given permutation can result from applying some permutation twice on the original alphabet string ABC...XYZ, otherwise output No.   Example  Input: 2 QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJKLZXCVBNM ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ  Output: No Yes  
  Given a string, identify the numbers and add those numbers and display the result    Input The first line contains a single integer T <= 40, the number of test cases. T test cases follow.

Output For each test case, output a single line containing the number of  alphabets that are repeated in the corresponding text.   Example Input: 3 aalmlc aPlmFl XcCnLb  Output: 2 1 1  
  Now a days it is possible to access particular website without typing it's full name. This helps in reducing the typing time. So in this you are given a website name as input and you have to cut short it's name and print the shoretd length of the website. The shortened version of the website name will be such that a user   won't have to type 'www.' to open a website anymore. You don't need to type vowels Though, you still need to type '.com' to open a website. Obviously, this means you can type the name of a website faster and save some time.     Input The first line contains T, the number of test cases. The second line contains the name of websites, as a string.  Output You have to print the ratio of characters you would have typed in shortest form to it's full form. Constraints: 1 <= T <= 100 1 <= Length of the website <= 200   Example Input: 2 www.google.com www.yahoo.com  Output: 7/14 6/13 
 For Turbo C++ Users : Read the following document before attempting the question :   Problem description.  The Skrulls are attacking our planet! The only way to stop them is to break into their weapons system and disable it. The password to disable the system is written on the machinery itself (in an encrypted form, obviously). Fortunately enough, you (Carol) know how to decrypt it:   You are given a list of 'N' integers. You need to select some elements from this list so that the product of the chosen numbers is biggest possible. At least 1 element has to be selected. Let this be 'X'. Now since 'X' may be too big, we want the remainder of X when it is divided by 1000000007 (ans % 1000000007).  Note about ‘modulo’:  The modulus operator (%) gives the remainder of division of 2 numbers. a % b = the remainder of division with a as ‘dividend’ and b as ‘divisor’. For eg. 5%3 = 2, since on dividing 5 by 3, we get 2 as remainder. Most languages support the % operator as the modulus operator. (to find modulus of x over y, just do z = x%y) Since we can’t really calculate the whole product and then take modulo, we take modulo on each step so as to keep the intermediate answer small by exploiting this property (a*b) % m = ((a%m)*(b%m))%m. To check overflow, you should use long data types instead of int data types (wherever reqd. and available).  If x<0 , x%m = (x+m)%m   Input First line contains 'T', the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains 'N', the number of elements in the original list. The next line contains 'N' elements of that list.  Output For each test case, print the required answer on a new line MODULO 1000000007.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 30 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6     Example Input: 1 4 -9 -11 771 23  Output: 1755567    Explanation We select all 4 numbers to yield the maximum product.

Format it like:  1 <= |S| <= 100000 1 <= Q <= 100  1 <= |T| <= 1000 All characters in the input are lowercase 'a'-'z'.     Example Input: aabcab 2 ac d  Output: 2 -1. 
 Ace has a team consisting of N players. He calls a subset of this team to be good if the subset has two or more players. He denotes all the good teams as S1 , S2 , S3 , ... , S2^N -N-1. Now he represents the GCD of the players of each good team Si as Gi. As you know Ace does not like to loose matches in COUNTER STRIKE and he can only win with the team having maximum Gi. Help Ace to find the maximum Gi .  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of players in the team. The second line contains N space-separated integersA1, A2, ..., AN denoting the players of the team.

Maximum gcd is 2 for the subset {2, 4} Example case 2. Maximum gcd is 12 for the subset {12, 36, 48}  
Shinchan is new to COUNTER STRIKE and he cannot differentiate between players of Terrorist and Counter Terrorist. Since he is new to COUNTER STRIKE so he used to kill his team members as he couldn't recognize them. Everyone got frustrated with him. One day he came up with a formula to recognize players by their user names.  This is his method: if the number of distinct characters in one's user name is odd, then he is a Counter Terrorist, otherwise he is a Terrorist. You are given the string that denotes the user name, please help Shinchan to recognize the players by his method.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Next T lines will contains a non-empty string, that contains only lowercase English letters(i.e. 'a' to 'z') — the user name.  Output  For each test case, output a single line containing "Terrorist" or "Counter Terrorist".     Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 400 1 ≤ length of user name ≤ 10^5     Example Input: 4 ace shars blizzard sak  Output: Counter Terrorist Terrorist Counter Terrorist Counter Terrorist    Explanation Example case 1. There are 3 different characters {a, c, e} which is Odd. Therefore, player is Counter Terrorist. Example case 2. There are 4 different characters {a, h, r, s} which is Even. Therefore, player is Terrorist. 
As you know in COUNTER STRIKE each player can belong to either Terrorist or Counter Terroritst. Let T denotes player belong to Terrorist and C denotes player belongs to Counter Terrorist. You are given a String S of length N-1, and it consists only of the letters C and T. You need to rearrange the numbers from 1 to N(including 1 and N) and save it an array X such that  if S[i] = T  -->  X[i] > X[i+1]    if S[i ] = C  --> X[i] < X[i+1] As there can be many such permutations, you need to print the lexicographically  largest permutation.  Input The only line of input contains a String S  Output The output contains N space separated integers(i.e. permutation of N numbers as described above).  Constraints 1 ≤ length of String ≤ 10^5    Example Input: CCCCCT  Output: 2 3 4 5 6 7 1    Explanation Example case 1. The lexicographically largest permutation that satisfies the given condition is: 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 
Finally Shinchan and Ace won all the matches of COUNTER STRIKE but they have forgotten to do their homework. Help them to finish their homework as it is already too late. You are given a weighted tree with W nodes. Nodes are numbered from 1 to W. For each node, you need to print the sum of distance of the nodes to all other nodes. Mathematically, for each node w, print the value of the expression Distance from node w to 1st node + Distance from node w to 2nd node +..... + Distance from node w to Wth node  Input Format The first line contains T, the number of test cases. For each test case, there are multiple lines. The first line contains W, the number of nodes in the tree. The next W−1 lines describe the tree; each line contains 3 integers X, Y, and Z, which denote that there is an edge from X to Y with weight Z.

Input First line of input contains t, the number of test cases. The next 't' lines contain n, the number that is given to Popeye by Olive. 0 0  Output Output would be a single number, that would be the number of values given to Popeye that can be expressed as a sum of two cubes.  Example  Input: 5 40 35 53 65 27  Output: 3 
Besides numbers Alice also likes to play with cubes of letters. She has infinite supply of the cubes with every lowercase Latin letter written on it. So she often builds the towers from her cubes. Specifically, there are N initially empty towers of cubes. Step-by-step, Alice picks a cube and puts it to the top of some of the towers. Sometimes she becomes curious about how many towers contain some of her M favorite words (not necessarily real English words). Alice considers that a tower contains a word in case this word can be read on some consecutive "subtower" of this tower in up-down direction. For example, if Alice puts cubes with letters a, b, c, d (in this order) to the top of the tower, then the tower contains words cba or dc and doesn't contain words abcd, e. But now the towers has grown very large, so Alice asks you to help her. There will be three types of queries given to you:  0 X C: put the cube with letter C to the top of the X^th tower. 1 L R P: find the number of towers in the range [L, R] which contain the P^th favorite word. 2 L R P: find the number of ways to pick a tower in the range [L; R] and then to read an occurrence of the P^th favorite word at this tower. Two ways are considered different, if the tower or if the topmost cube position of the occurrence are different.  Please help Alice.  Input The first line of the input contains three space-separated integers N, M and Q denoting the number of towers, the number of Alice's favorite words and the number of queries respectively. Each of the following M lines contains a lowercase Latin letters string wi, denoting the i^th favorite word of Alice. Each of the following Q lines contains a query in one of the formats described above.  Output For each query of the type 1 or 2, output the answer on the separate line.  Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ Q ≤ 2 × 10^5 1 ≤ X ≤ N 1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ N 1 ≤ P ≤ M ≤ 65536 1 ≤ sum of |wi| ≤ 65536 All wi's are different. C is a lowercase Latin letter wi contains only lowercase Latin letters There will be no more than 65536 queries of the type 0.   Example Input: 3 2 10 a ab 0 1 a 1 1 2 1 0 2 a 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 2 0 1 a 2 1 3 1 0 1 b 1 1 2 2 2 2 3 1  Output: 1 2 0 3 0 1  Explanation  In the second query the only tower containing the word a is the tower 1 In the fourth query the towers containing the word a are towers 1 and 2 In the fifth query there is no even a single tower containing the word ab In the seventh query there are two ways to read the word a at the tower 1 (starting at the topmost or at the bottommost cube), one way to read the word a at the tower 2 (since this tower consists only of one cube with letter a) and zero ways to read the word a at the tower 3 (since it's empty) In the ninth query there is no way to read the word ab from any tower. Please pay attention that if we try to read a two-letter word from the top of the first tower, we will get ba and not ab In the tenth query the only tower containing the word a is the tower 2, and since it consists only of one cube with letter a, there is surely only one way to read this word  
The EEE classroom is quite an explosive class. The explosiveness depends on the type and number of students present in the class. Specifically, the explosiveness doubles every time a new person enters the class and finds at least one member of his gang already present in the class.  Given the details of the class gangs, print the minimum possible explosiveness of the class mod 1000000007.   Input The first line of the input contains two integers, N the number of students present in the class and M . The next M lines contain 2 integers A and B such that student number (A and student number B belong to the same gang.  Output Print the minimum possible explosiveness of the class mod 1000000007 by optimizing the entry sequence of the students. The initial explosiveness of the class is  1 . Only one student enters the class at a time and all the n students must attend the class (Attendance shortage is a big issue here).  Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 1000000 0 ≤ M ≤ (N*(N-1))/2 1 ≤ A, B ≤ N   Example Input: 5 3 1 2 2 3 5 4 Output: 8  Explanation Example case 1.  Let the entry sequence be 5 1 2 3 4. When 5 enters the class, the explosiveness doesn't change. Same is the case with 1 as no member of his gang is present. 2 enters and finds 1 so the explosiveness doubles to 1*2 = 2. 3 doubles it again to 2*2 = 4. Finally 4 enters and finds 5 so the explosiveness doubles again to 2*4 = 8. Therefore the answer is 8 % 1000000007 = 8.

Here's a challenge that's a bit more mathematical in nature. Write a program that determines the number of trailing zeros at the end of X! (X factorial), where X is an arbitrary number. For instance, 5! is 120, so it has one trailing zero. (How can you handle extremely values, such as 100!?)    Example  Input:  An integer e.g 5!  Output:  No of trailing zeros in answer, 5! Is 120 so it has one trailing zero  
Earlier days, in BUEST, salary to teachers is given in the form of special coins named as BUEST coins. Any teacher could exchange it with the bank into three coins n/,n/3/n/4. But since in the world, it will be very difficult with those decimals to purchase things so simply bank rounds off the values. As the institute has foreign collaboration with universities, so in a faculty exchange program if a teacher goes to Japan, then he could exchange BUEST cons with Yen. Suppose you have one BUEST coin. What is the maximum amount of yen can get to survive in Japan.   Input The input will contain several test cases. Each test case is a single line with a number n. it is is the number written on your coin   Output For each test case output the singles line, containing the maximum amount of Japanese Yen a teacher can make.   Example  Input:  12 2  Output:  13 2

While Tom Cruise(Cage) fighting in the movie "Edge of Tomorrow", he finds himself in a modern lab, where he needs to kill the brain of a mutant species Omega. The DNA of the Omega is made up of characters of A, T, G and C like ours. He has certain enzymes which will cut and remove certain parts of this DNA. The mutant being an intelligent species, is able to reform its DNA, even after a piece of DNA is removed.  You will be given a DNA sequence, and few enzymes. Suppose, a DNA sequence goes like this : ATGCTGCTATGCATGCAGTGACT, and you are given enzymes which can remove AT and GC sequences. Thereby, you need to remove all occurrences of AT from the DNA first and then reform the DNA and apply the next enzyme to remove all occurrences of GC. The output of the problem would be the string you get at last reforming the pieces which are not removed by these enzymes. Input The first line of input consists of an integer n that denotes the number of enzymes. The second line has the DNA sequence. The next n lines has the input B1, B2, B3... Bn. Output For given input DNA sequence, output a single line containing the final reformed DNA that is formed by repeatedly removing all the occurrences of B1, B2, B3... Bn from A. In case the DNA is completely consumed print 0 to indicate that there is no DNA left.  Constraints  1 <= n <= 10  Example  Input: 2 ATACGCATGACGATGCATGCAGCAT ATA GC   Output: CATGACGATATAAT  Input: 3 ATGCATGCATCGACTCAGCATCAGCATCGACTA TG GC AT  Output: ACACCGACTCACACGACTA 
  Reeti has just started learning how to code. As is the case with many programmers, one begins understanding algorithms with the help of pseudocode. Reeti has just started looking at some basic algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Binary Search etc. However, being a person with AOCD (Algorithmic Obsessive Compulsive Disorder), she does not rest until she has rigorously analysed the algorithm she is learning.   Now, she is looking at an algorithm to find the minimum element in an array. This is the pseudocode she is dealing with : 1.   int N; 2.   input N 3.   int arr[1:N]; 4.   for i=1...N: 5.       input arr[i] 6.   int min = INFINITY; 7.   for i=1...N: 8.       if(arr[i]<min) 9.           min = arr[i];   Reeti has just completed a course on Probability and Statistics, and being curious she decides to analyse the algorithm from a probabilistic point of view. She decides to ensure that the array arr is a randomly picked from the set of permutations of numbers 1,N. Her question is, what is the expected value of the number of reassignments to variable min i.e the number of times line 9 is executed.  Input  The first line of input is the number of test cases T.  The next T lines consist of a single integer N, i.e the size of the array for that test case.  Output  For each test case, print the expected value of the number of reassignments to min, with exactly 3 digits after the decimal point(rounded).  i.e Even if the answer is a whole number, print it as 5.000 Example  Input:  2 1 3    Output: 1.000 1.833   Explanation Example case 1. In the first test case, there is only 1 possible array. And we get one reassignment. So expected value is 1/1 = 1.  In the second test case, there are 6 possible arrays. In sorted order of arrays (descending), number of reassignments are 3,2,2,2,1,1. So expected value = 11/6 = 1.833 (3 decimal places)  
  Venkatesh the coder has come up with an idea to rank his fellow coders. His idea is to use the first name of the coders and rank them according to his own ranking algorithm.  Suppose the first name of some coder is "duk"(Venkatesh does not like capital letters). Venkatesh then wrote all permutations of the letters of "duk" in descending order.  ukd, udk, kud, kdu, duk, dku.  Now he numbers each permutation serially from 1. The serial number alloted to "duk" is his rank. Here "duk" gets a number "5" according to this algorithm.  However, the job is not done. Venkatesh needs to enter the details of this coder in an excel sheet in the column corresponding to this number. Columns in an excel  sheet are numbered alphabetically (in upper-case) as A,B,C,D.....Z,AA,AB......and so on. For example, the row corresponding to this number would be 'E'.  Assume that an excel sheet can have a large number of columns i.e column numbers like AAA,GHTY,KIUGH are possible.  Kindly help Venkatesh to find out which column to store his fellow coder's name in.  Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T(1<=T<=10) denoting the number of test cases.  The next T lines will be a string of lower-case characters representing a coder's name, for which you need to find out the column id.  Length of string will not exceed 10 characters. Output  For each name, you need to print a string of upper-case alphabets corresponding to the column, where the name of the coder will be placed according to this algorithm. Example  Input: 2 duk abcde    Output: E DP   Explanation Example case 1. "duk" as shown above gets alloted a rank of 5. "abcde" will be the last element in the listing, so will be assigned a rank of 120; which when converted will fall into column DP. 
 With her new hair-style, Penny has to listen to all the comments of Sheldon Cooper. She (God knows why) challenged Sheldon Cooper for a match of Chess. Penny wants to defeat Dr. Sheldon Cooper in the game of chess. Although, she tried very hard, she is in a situation and wants your help. It is your duty to help Penny. The situation goes like this. Penny has only "King" left with her, while Sheldon has a King, a Queen, a Rook and a Bishop. You are given a situation of a chess board as input. Sheldon has given Penny a CHECK, you need to tell Penny, whether this is the end of the game or she still has a chance. In case, she still has a choice, ensure she is safe in the next step too.  P.S. All rules of chess apply here. The death of a King is considered as end of the game. You can also refer to  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess for the rules. Input A description of the 8X8 chessboard grid is given. Empty boxes are shown as "_", Penny's King is shown by P, Sheldon's king is shown by S, and the queen, rook and bishop are shown by Q, R and B respectively. Output Print CHECKMATE! if its a checkmate, else print NOT YET!. Consider each and every possible ways, and remember ALL rules of Chess applies here. Example  Input: ____B___ ________ __Q_____ ________ ____P_S_ _R______ ________ ________  Output: NOT YET!  Input:  ________ ________ ___S____ ______B_ Q__P___ _R______ ________ ________  Output: CHECKMATE! Explanation Example case 1. Penny can still move her King to either one step Up or one step to left. So, this isn't a checkmate. 
  Ayan's favourite musical instrument is the keyboard. He practices regularly as well, you can hear him playing even at 3 or 4 in the night. Unfortunately, he got into a fight in his room and his keyboard was damaged beyond repair. However, being a rich fellow he quickly ordered another one. But this time he felt a bit adventurous. He decided to buy a circular keyboard i.e keys are arranged in a circle. This funky keyboard has only 12 keys though - C,C#,D,D#,E,F,F#,G,G#,A,B and S. Since the layout is quite different to what he is used to, he needs to relearn basics of music theory again. Firstly, a semitone is the distance between any two keys. So there are 3 semitones between D and F, and 2 semitones between S and C# (remember it is circular!) He knows a chord is an unordered set of three or more than three keys. However, Ayan wants to start slow and considers only triads - chords of size 3. Triads come in two varieties - major and minor. In a major triad the number of semitones between the first and second key is 4, and between the second and third - 3. Minor triads on the other hand have 3 semitones between the first and second keys, 4 semitones between the second and third one. For example, D F# A is a major triad, while D F A is minor. Ayan needs your help classifying some basic triads. Kindly help him.   Input  The first line of input is the number of test cases T (1<=T<=25).  The next T lines contain three characters corresponding to the musical keys on the circular keyboard.  Note that # keys will be given as small letters and normal keys as capital letters. So C# will be given as c, while D will remain D.  It is guaranteed that the triads will be either major or minor.  Output  For each test case, print "Major" or "Minor" in a separate line, depending on whether the given triad is major or minor. Example  Input:  2 E G S S d f    Output: Minor Major   Explanation Example case 1. E and G have a 3 semitone gap, while G and S have a 4 semitone gap. So Minor.  S and D# have a 4 semitone gap (remember circular) and D# and F# have a 3 semitone gap. So Major.  
  Aakash Chan the builder is given the task of constructing an expensive hotel in Bakerstreet. He is given N pillars to start with. To make the hotel look good all the N pillars should be of the same height. You can either decrease or increase the height of a pillar. To change the height of  the i th pillar, where 1<= i <= N, by 1 unit(you can either increase its height or decrease it) you must pay cost[i] golds. *see example cases for clarification* You must help Aakash by printing the height at which all the pillars must be set to, such that the overall construction cost is minimized.

  You have a N x M matrix of cells. The cell (i, j) represents the cell at row i and column j. You can go from one cell (i, j) only down or right, that is to cells (i + 1, j) or (i, j + 1). But K cells are blocked in the matrix(you can’t visit a blocked cell). You are given coordinates of all these cells. You have to count number of ways to reach cell (N, M) if you begin at cell (1, 1). Two ways are same if and only if path taken is exactly same in both ways.   Input First line consists of T, denoting the number of test cases. Each test case consists of N, M and K in single line.

A cyclist, bored of congested roads, decides that she no longer wants to go the shortest route from her hostel to the college. She has decided that it is safer to follow routes with bicycle lanes. Roads have cycle lanes in both directions - however, they have gaps in their cycle-lane coverage. For this question, you are given a network of roads. With each road, there is a score, of the percentage of its length supporting a bicycle lane. You can assume that the percentages are unique floating-point values. The "safety-factor" of a path from hostel to college is the least score of a road on that path. You have to compute the path from hostel to college, with the largest safety-factor.  Input The input consists of several lines. The first line is a number saying how many networks are present in the input. This is followed by lines describing each network. The first line of each network has a single number (let’s call it v) -- the number of vertices in the network. This is followed by a number of lines, each describing a road. Each road is  given as three numbers separated by spaces - the first two being the nodes connected by the edge, and the third a floating-point number representing the percentage of cycle-lane coverage (between 0 and 100, inclusive). The end of the list of roads for a network is denoted by three "-1"s in a line. The college is always assumed to be node 1 and the hostel is always assumed to be the node with the highest index. There is at most one road between any pair of vertices. There is certainly at least one path that connects the hostel and the college.  Output The output should have several lines. The i-th line describes the safety factor of the i-th network in the input. The output should be within 10^-6 of the answer.

Keyboard typing is the main source of our input to the computer. We use keyboard for textual inputs. But to err is human. Suppose that in typing a document the user makes a mistake. He types a letter to the right of the actual character letter on the keyboard. Write a program to take the user string as input and display the actual correct string. Note: Apply the required constraint.   Example  Input: Sdfghj Output: Asdfgh  
Magic matrix is a square matrix of odd number of rows and columns. The noticeable thing in this is that the sum of all the numbers either row wise, column wise or diagonally equals to the same digit and each number can be used just once in this matrix. Write a program to develop a magic matrix of resultant sum 57.   Example   Output: 22  15  20 17  19  21 18  23  16   
GUI matters greatly to the user but another major concern is the security of the information. There are a lot of ways to implement security of data. Of these one method is the replacement cipher text generation method. In this each character is replaced by a particular other character and the text is modified. Write a program to display a text box on the screen and every input character given by the user should be displayed as ‘*’ mark. The program should meet the following constraint The working of enter, backspace should be as usual. After pressing enter, the password is encrypted using replacement cipher text generating and saved in the file named “pass.txt”. *********   Example  Input abcdefghi  Output: bcdefghij

 A tutorial for this problem is now available on our blog. Click here to read it. Being in love with number theory, Johnny decided to take a number theory course. On the first day, he was challenged by his teacher with the following problem: given a number N, compute the product of its positive divisors. Johnny is desperate to impress his new teacher so he asks you for help. In this problem, the divisors of N do not include the number N itself. For example, if N=12, the divisors of N (excluding N) are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. Thus, the product of divisors is 1x2x3x4x6=144. Since the result may be very large, if the result has more than 4 decimal digits, Johnny only needs to compute the last 4 digits of it.  Input The first line contains t, the number of test cases (about 300,000). Then t test cases follow. Each test case contains a single integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 500,000) whose product of divisors needs to be computed.  Output For each test case, print a single line containing the corresponding result of that test case.  Example  Input 6 3 4 12 25 957 10000  Output 1 2 144 5 7493 0000

 Problem Description Utkarsh is on his way to Q shrines on the X axis. The ith Shrine is present at X=Li. For each shrine, Utkarsh will start at X=0 and move forward with the help of an array A of size N which will help him to reach the shrines. To move forward he must choose an index 1<=i<=N which allows him to jump A[i] units forward in the positive X axis. Utkarsh hates forgetting the past so he has an initially empty stack S to help him remember which indices of the array he chose. More specifically whenever he chooses index i of A, he pushes i at the top of the stack S. Utkarsh will only be able to enter the ith shrine if he is at X=Li and  |S|>0 . However, the converse is not true, i.e., Utkarsh may choose to not enter the shrine even if the above conditions are satisfied. Since Utkarsh is getting thinner nowadays, he would be able to carry stacks of size at most K. Utkarsh wonders how many different stacks can he have when he enters the ith shrine. (Two stacks are considered different iff they have different sizes or they contain different index value at some position) Output the answer modulo 10^9+7 for each shrine. Output 0 if he cannot enter the ith shrine.   INPUT First line contains N and K. Next line contains the array A. Next line contains Q. Next line contains all the Li.

Under the moon light, over the smooth dark water surface, Titanic was sailing along. Quite beautifully, wih sparkling light, it seemed to be flying. But air does not have ice bergs. A sudden crashing sound and a piece of ice floating by. But the depth is far greater than what it looks on the surface. Our ship is hit and has taken serious damages. The iceberg has damaged one of the sectors in the lowermost level. ( Where were the Lookers looking from the Look Out?? !! )  The captain has assigned you the job of finding the total time in sinking of the ship. The ship is considered sunk only when all the sectors at all levels are drowned completely in water.  A ship is represented in sectors as below:  + + + + +  + + + +   + + +  n is the number of sectors in the topmost level, k is the number of levels.  The first(topmost) level contains n sectors, 2nd contains n-1 sectors, and the k-th(lowermost) sector contains n-k+1 sectors. Water starts getting into a sector only when one(or both) of the following conditions are met: * a neighbor of the sector is completely drowned. * both the sectors under a sector are completely drowned.     +  a  +      b  c   Here, "a" will drown when both "b" and "c" are completely drowned. OR either of the neighbors ( + ) are completely submerged into water.  Input The first line contains the number of test cases (about 10). t test cases follow. For each test case, the first line contains three integers n( ≤ 1000), k( The next k lines contain the integers denoting the time taken for the sectors in k-th level to drown completely.

The Titanic ship is sinking. The nearest ship has answered the SOS call, and come to rescue the people. Everyone is anxious to get to safety. Unfortunately, the new ship may not have enough room to take everyone to safe land. This adds to the anxiety of people.  To avoid stampede, there has to be some rescue plan. You are made incharge of this. You have to make sure that as many people are safe as possible. Given the capacity of the ship, that is, the number of people that can board the ship, you have to calculate how many men, women and children can be sent to safety.  The following rules apply:  * The foremost priority is safety for children, but there must be atleast one adult (a man or a woman) for every four  children sent to the rescue ship. For upto four children, one adult, for five to eight children, 2 adults, and so on.  * Next priority is for women, but there must be at least one man for every two women. For upto two women, one man, for three to four women, two men, and so on.  Input First line contains the number of test cases (t less than 10000) The next t lines contain four integers (each between 1 to 10000 inclusive) each separated by a single space. The integers represent the capacity of the rescue ship, number of men on TITANIC, number of women and number of children, in this order.  Output Display t lines, each line has three space separated integers denoting the number of men, women and children put to safety, in this order.  Example  Input: 3 17 5 10 19 18 2 6 10 20 5 2 23  Output: 2 2 13 2 4 10 2 2 16   Explanation: Explanation for case 2: Since only 2 men are present, the number of women can not be more than 4.  
The captain of the ship TITANIC is a little .... off the track. He needs to select the crew for the ship. But everyone seems to be eligible. So to test their intelligence, he plays a game.  The contestants have to stand in a line. They are given the numbers in the order in which they stand, starting from 1. The captain then removes all the contestants that are standing at an odd position.  Initially, standing people have numbers - 1,2,3,4,5... After first pass, people left are - 2,4,... After second pass - 4,.... And so on.  You want to board the ship as a crew member. Given the total number of applicants for a position, find the best place to stand in the line so that you are selected.  Input First line contains the number of test cases t (t ≤ 10^5). The next t lines contain integer n, the number of applicants for that case.

The scheme as stated by chef’s friend is as follows:  There are different types of items available for the sale. A person can buy a number of these items. From the items that will be purchased, the type of item which has the most frequency was found out and that particular frequency was recorded. Now, if this recorded number is a prime number, then half of the items of the item type that has a prime number frequency will be given as free and if the recorded number is a composite number, then half of the items of the item type that has a composite frequency will be given as free. You need to help the chef’s friend in finding the final bill generated after all the deductions according to the scheme as stated above. You need to do this for a number of test cases. The cost of each item is $1. The items are depicted with use of characters (a-z, A-Z ), i.e., the items of same type are depicted with the same character. For an odd number, say n the value of n/2 is the value obtained after passing n/2 through the greatest integer function. For example:  11/2 will be 5.   Input The first line contains the number of test cases t, that is, the number of people who purchase from the garage sale. The first and the only line of each test case contains a string s, the items purchased (containing a-z, A-Z ) by a person. .   Output The output for each test case contains an integer in a separate line denoting the total amount paid by the person after the deductions being made according to the garage sale.   Constraints 1<= t<= 100 1<=|s|<=10000  Example Input: 3 abcdefghig aabbccddddef Aabcdef  Output: 9 10 7   Explanation Example case 1. The frequency of 'g' is maximum, i.e., 2. The frequency of only 'g' is prime so half of items of type 'g' will be free. So, 1 item will be free.  Example case 2. The frequency of 'd' is maximum, i.e., 4, which is a composite number. The frequency of only 'd' is composite so half of items of type 'd' will be free. So, 2 items will be free.

We are all familiar with the Sheldon's spot. For all those, who don't know about it, Sheldon's Spot is a place in Sheldon and Leonard's apartment which Sheldon has claimed as his own. Sheldon defines his seat as "It is the singular location in space around which revolves my entire universe." Sheldon relates his spot to himself in mathematical terms in "The Cushion Saturation": "In an ever-changing world it is a single point of consistency. If my life were expressed as a function on a four-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, that spot, at the moment I first sat on it, would be (0,0,0,0). We are only concerned with the first two dimensions in this cartesian coordinate system that represents the plane in which Sheldon and people around him are walking. Sheldon is intitally standing on his spot, this represents the point (0,0) in the plane. He is playing paint ball with his friends in this plane. He has a mission, in which, he needs to get to a coordinate (x1,y1) in the same plane. There are n other coordinates in this plane which he can use as intermediate points on his way to get to the point (x1,y1). If he is moving from point A to point B, then he has to walk along the line segment joining these points. To move S units in this coordinate system, sheldon has to spend S*S Cal of energy. He wants the energy used to be minimum. You task is to find a path such that the energy expenditure is minimum. After this print the minimum amount of energy needed.   Input The first line of input contains 3 integers, n, x1, y1. Here n is the number of coordiantes in the plane and (x1,y1) is the destination point. After this n lines follow, each containing 2 integers, x and y. All these (x,y) pairs are n coordinates in the plane as stated in the problem statement.

Po - the Panda, is the chosen dragon warrior who is destined to bring peace in the universe. He fights evil Kung Fu Masters. He is amazingly witty, but wittier is his master, Master Shifu, who taught him the strongest move he knows, THE WUXI FINGER HOLD. But little does his master know that his skills are not the secret to his power, but chocolates, which his daddy makes for him. But now, there is trouble in the paradise. Tai Lung has come to defeat the dragon warrior, and to prepare Po, his daddy needs chocolates. But unfortunately, the stock of ingredients to make the chocolates has finished. So daddy rushes to the market to buy the ingredients. In the market, there is only one shop, and taking benefit of this thing, the shopkeeper charges hefty! There are a total N ingredients in the shop, each with a cost Ci. There is an infinite supply of each ingredient in the shop. The battle will last D days, so each day, daddy buys a contiguous subset of the ingredients defined by index L and R(1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ N). Daddy buys all ingredients, one each, from index L to R(inclusive).Now the problem is the calculation of the total cost of the ingredients. The shopkeeper's formula for deciding the total cost of the ingredients is as follows:Let there be K different ingredients with cost C, so the cost with the normal calculation for all these ingredients should be K*C, but according to the shopkeeper, the cost of these ingredients is K*K*C.You need to find out the total cost for each day.    Input First line of the input will contain two integers N and D, the number of ingredients and the number of days respectively.

Devu has an array A consisting of N positive integers. He would like to perform following operation on array.  Pick some two elements a, b in the array (a could be same as b, but their corresponding indices in the array should not be same). Remove both the elements a and b and instead add a number x such that x lies between min(a, b) and max(a, b), both inclusive, (i.e. min(a, b) ≤ x ≤ max(a, b)).   Now, as you know after applying the above operation N - 1 times, Devu will end up with a single number in the array. He is wondering whether it is possible to do the operations in such a way that he ends up a number t.   He asks your help in answering Q such queries, each of them will contain an integer t and you have to tell whether it is possible to end up t.   Input There is only one test case per test file. First line of the input contains two space separated integers N, Q denoting number of elements in A and number of queries for which Devu asks your help, respectively Second line contains N space separated integers denoting the content of array A. Each of the next Q lines, will contain a single integer t corresponding to the query.

  Rohan, a young scientist, has developed a new programming language. In his new language, he has developed a special type of operator which he has termed as digit-wise operator. The language is in its Beta phase, so as of now, there are only two digit-wise operator which are + and *. The digit-wise operator + performs digit wise addition, while * performs digit wise multiplication. They work almost the same as bitwise operator work, differing only in the aspect that instead of working on bits, they work on digits of integers, also it outputs only the last digit of the result and the digit is printed in words (where all character are in lower case English alphabets).

Each line of test case contains two space separated integers followed by a space, and then, the operand i.e. one of the digit-wise operator (+ or *).  Output For each test case, output the result that has been asked for in the problem statement.    Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 1000 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ B ≤ 10^5     Example Input: 2 1324 3950 + 6139 3850 *  Output: four two seven four eight eight five zero   
For any positive integer, we define a digit rotation as either moving the first digit to the end of the number (left digit rotation), or the last digit to the front of the number (right digit rotation). For example, the number 12345 could be left digit rotated to 23451, or right digit rotated to 51234. If there are any leading zeros after digit rotation, they must be removed. So 10203 could be left digit rotated to 2031, then left digit rotated again to 312. Given an integer N, determine the largest integer that can result from performing a series of one or more digit rotations on N.  Input Input will begin with an integer T (at most 1000), the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a positive integer N<100000000 (10^8) on a line by itself.  Output For each test case, print the largest integer that can result from performing one or more digit rotations on N.  Sample Input 6 12345 54321 10901 211011 7 90   Sample Output 51234 54321 11090 211011 7 9 
  Brock likes competitive programming very much. Therefore he decided to take training from Ash, one of the best coaches in India. Ash used to give an assignment to his students every day. He was known for his difficult problems and only the best of his students could solve those problems. It was Brock's first day in the camp and he wanted to impress his Coach by solving the problem. But after spending 6 hours on the problem, Brock wants help from you. Help Brock solve the problem which goes as follows.  You have n dishes and m ingredients given. Dishes are numbered from 1 to n.Each ingeredient can be represented as an english lowercase alphabet(a to z).  Each dish can contain only one ingredient. Some of the dishes already contains an ingredient and some of them doesn't which is represented by a '?'. Now you have to add any of the m ingrediemts to this unknown dish(unknown dish will be represented by '?'. Multiple dishes may have the same ingredient. You are also given Q restrictions of the form (x y) where each restriction reperesents that dish x and dish y should have the same ingredient in it.(1-based index) You have to tell the number of ways to add ingredients to unknown dishes so that all the Q restrictions are followed. As number of ways can be very large answer it as modulo 1000000007. Two ways are considered different if there is at least one dish with different ingredient. If it is impossible to satisfy all Q conditions output -1.     Input First line will contain n and m (number of dishes and number of ingredients). All the dishes are numbered from 1 to n and ingredients from 1 to m where m<=26 Next line will follow a string representing n dishes where each character will be lowercase english alphabet or a question mark('?'). Next line will contain an integer Q, number of restrictions. Next Q lines will follow pairs of integers x y.The ingredient in dish x and y should be same.  Output Output a single line containing number of ways to fill ingredients in unknown dishes satisfying given Q restrictions. Output your answer by taking modulo with 1000000007. If it is impossible to get such configuration then output -1. For better understanding look at the explanation given below.    Constraints Example 1 Input: 5 3 ababc 1 1 3  Output: 1  Example 2 Input: 5 4 ab?b? 1 1 3  Output: 4  Example 3 Input: 5 3 a?cb? 2 1 3 2 5  Output: -1    Explanation Example case 1. The only valid final form is "ababc". So number of ways will be 1. Example case 2. The valid forms are: "ababa","ababb","ababc","ababd" Example case 3. No valid configuration can be formed as position 1 and 3 should be same but they are already given some different ingredients 
Papa Smurf is trying his hands on a new type of dish named IngrediMix. The process of preparation of this dish requires N ingredients (namely a0, a1, a2,... aN-1) to be mixed together in one bowl. Every ingredients has a nutritional value (v0, v1, ..., vN-1) associated with it. The process of creation of dish continues until we have all ingredients mixed in one single bowl. In each step, we follow any one of the following steps a) Select one of the unselected ingredient, ar, and put it in a new bowl. The nutritional value of this bowl will be vr. b) Select one of the unselected ingredient, ar, and put it in a bowl already containing ingredient ar-1 (or ar+1). If the ingredient ar and ar-1 (or ar+1) has additive binding, then the nutritional value of the bowl is increased by vr. If they have multiplicative binding, then the nutritional value of the bowl is increased by the factor of vr. c) Select any two bowls A and B, such that if Bowl A has ingredient ar, then Bowl B must have ingredient ar-1 (or ar+1). Merge Bowl B into Bowl A. If the ingredient ar and ar-1 (or ar+1) has additive binding, then the nutritional value of the bowl A is increased by the nutritional value of bowl B. If they have multiplicative binding relation, then the nutritional value of the bowl A is increased by the factor of nutritional value of bowl B. Papa Smurf wants to mix the ingredients in such a manner such that the final dish has maximum nutritional value. Help him.  Input The first line of input contains a single number, T, number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains an integer N, total number of ingredients. Then in second line, we have N space separated integers (v0, v1,..., vN-1) representing the nutritional value of ingredients. In third line we have a string S containing N-1 characters, representing the binding relation between ingredients. If S[i] = 'a' then, there is an additive binding relation between ingredient ai and ai+1. If S[i] = 'm', then we have a multiplicative binding relation between ingredients ai and ai+1.  Output For each test case, find the maximum nutritional value Papa Smurf can get for his dish. As this number can be very large, print the answer modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7).  Constraints 1 ≤ T ≤ 10 2 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^5  Example  Input: 1 5 1 2 3 4 5 amam  Output: 105   Explanation The following procedure describes the mixing process to be adopted by the Papa Smurf. 1. Ingredient a0 (v0 = 1) is taken in bowl A. Ingredient a1 (v1 = 2) is added to it to yield a mixture having nutritional value 3 since the binding is additive in nature. 2. Ingredient a2 (v2 = 3) is taken in bowl B. Ingredient a3 (v3 = 4) is added to it to yield a mixture having nutritional value 7 since the binding is additive in nature. 3. Now ingredient a4 (v4 = 5) is added to bowl B and the nutritional value of this bowl changes to 35 as a3 and a4 has multiplicative binding relation. 4. Now the mixture in bowl B is added to the mixture in bowl A to get a final mixture, having nutritional value of 105. As bowl B has ingredient a2 and bowl A has ingredient a1, and they have a multiplicative biding, the nutritional values of both bowls are multiplied. 5. Dish preparation process stops as bowl A has all ingredient and it can be easily verified that this is the highest nutritional value possible with the given order of ingredients.

As we all know, Dhoni loves drinking milk. Once he and Sir Jadeja were invited in the inauguration of a Dairy company in Ranchi.  The company had arranged  n   jars of milk from various breeds of cows , jar number  i  containing  a[i]  litres of milk. Since Dhoni loves driking milk more than Sir Jadeja, so Kohli suggested a plan for them. His plan was that each time Dhoni will choose a jar containing the maximum amount of milk. If this jar has less than  k   litres of milk or if Dhoni has already drunk more than  m  number of times from this jar, then the milk contained in the jar will be drunk by Sir Jadeja. Sir Jadeja will drink all the milk left in that jar. Otherwise Dhoni will drink exactly k  litres of milk from the jar and put it back at its position. Dhoni will do so until he has given all jars to Sir Jadeja.  You have to calculate how much milk Sir Jadega will get after Dhoni satisfies his hunger modulo 1,000,000,007.

Not long after their country lifted the World Cup, the people of Nobitaville decided to organize a Victory Marathon for celebrations. While other preparations were in order, Mr.Doraemon, who happened to be a very moody person, made it clear by announcing that he would let the Marathon take place only if Jerseys were distributed among people in some sort of order. He added that the richest person should get the smallest Jersey Number and the next richest person, the second smallest jersey number, and so on and so forth. If this order would be taken care of, the mayor would happily let the people enjoy the Marathon, else everybody would be sent back home. The people are really looking forward to enjoy the Marathon but are quite worried about this wish of the mayor and hence, need your help. Jerseys have already been distributed among the people. You need to check whether the Marathon will take place or not, so that if not, the people can reshuffle the jerseys and fulfill the mayor's wish.  Input The first line of Input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains an integer N, denoting the number of people participating in the Marathon. This is followed by two lines, each containing N number of entries. The first line contains N  distinct numbers, denoting the Jersey Number of the people( Ai ). The second line contains N numbers, denoting the wealth of the people( Bi ), with ith wealth corresponding to the ith person, mentioned in the previous line.  Output If the Jerseys have been distributed in the order the Mayor demands, print "YES" and if not, print "NO" (without quotes).  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ Ai ≤ 10^9 1 ≤ Bi ≤ 10^9   Example Input: 2 5 2 3 5 1 4 600 400 100 2000 250 4 7 9 11 12 6000 7000 4000 102  Output: YES NO   NOTE: Jersey Numbers will not be provided in non-decreasing fashion. 
Problem Statement One of the most popular games played in bitotsav gaming events is DOTA. Ezalor, Keeper of the Light is a great dota hero, but playing this hero needs good codediction and he needs you to help him with this. Ezalor has a powerful spell called illuminate, which attacks all the hero dealing them a lot damage in a straight line. The guy playing this hero has decided to cast illuminate only in direction parallel to axes of the rectangular dota map. Think of dota map as a rectangular gird of rows and columns(1<=R<=40, 1<=C<=40).Each cell in the map consists either an ally or an enemy. The spell of ezalor is 1 unit wide and he can control the length of the spell. Each 'illuminate' spell can be cast only alligned parallel to one of the sides of the map. Ezalor doesnt want to affect the game of other ally heros so he would always make sure that his spell is not casted on the cell of any ally. Ezalor wishes to minimize the number of spells he has to cast, so that every enemy is hit atleast once, an enemy can be hit with the spell more than once. You have to compute the minimum no of spells required. Input Specification  t number of the test cases. Each test case begins with a line containing two space separated intergers R and C, then R lines follows. each line has a string of C characters with '*' recodesenting an enemy and '.' recodesenting an ally.   Output Specification  For each test case output a single line containing an integer recodesenting the number of spells Ezalor needs.   Sample Input  2 3 4 **** *.*. *.** 4 2 *. *. .* .*   Sample Output  4 2  
The palindrome is a string that can be read the same way from left to right and from right to left. For example, strings "aaaaa", "1221", "bbaabb" are palindromes, however the string "chef" is not a palindrome because if we read it from right to left, we will obtain "fehc" that is not the same as "chef".  We call a string a "double string" if it has an even length and the first half of this string is equal to the second half of this string, for example "abab" is a double string because the first half "ab" is equal to the second half "ab", however the string "abba" is not a double string because the first half "ab" is not equal to the second half "ba". The empty string "" is a double string, and its length is 0.  Chef doesn't like palindromes, however he likes "double strings". He often likes to change the order of letters in some palindrome and sometimes to remove some symbols from it. Now he wonders: if a palindrome of length N is given, what is the maximal possible number of characters in a "double string" that can be obtained by removing and changing the order of symbols in it?   Input Several test cases are given. The first line of the sample input contains an integer T - the number of test cases. Then, T lines follow. Each line consists of a single integer N - the length of a palindrome.  Output For each test case output a single integer - answer to the problem.   Constraints 1<=T<=10000 1<=N<=1000000000   Example  Input: 2 2 4  Output: 2 4 
     Children         are taught to add multi-digit numbers from right-to-left one digit at a time.         Many find the "carry" operation - in which 1 is carried from one digit position         to be added to the next - to be a significant challenge.  Your job is to         count the number of carry operations         for each of addition problem so that educators may assess their difficulty.       Input   Each line of input contains two unsigned         integers less than 10 digits.   The last line of input contains 0 0.       Output   For each line of input except the last         output the number of carry operations that would result from adding the two         numbers, in the format shown below.       Sample Input   123 456   555 555   123 594   0 0       Sample Output   No carry operation.   3 carry operations.   1 carry operation.     
 Ali knows how to count, but he is now learning how to             write numbers. As he is a very good student, he already learned 1, 2, 3 and 4.             But he did not realize yet that 4 is different from 1, so he thinks that 4 is             another way to write 1. Besides that, he is having fun with a little game he             created himself: he make numbers (with those four digits) and sum their values.             For instance:   132 = 1 + 3 + 2 = 6   112314 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 9   (Remember that Ali thinks that 4 = 1)       After making a lot of numbers in this way, Ali now             wants to know how much numbers he can create such that their sum is a number n.             For instance, for n=2 he noticed that he can make 5 numbers: 11, 14, 41, 44 and             2 (he knows how to count them up, but he does not know how to write five).             However, he cannot figure it out for n greater that 2. So, he asked you to help             him.       Input:   Input will consist on an arbitrary number of sets.             Each set will consist on an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 1000. You must read             until you reach the end of file.       Output:   For each number read, you must output another number             (on a line alone) stating how much numbers Ali can make such that the sum of             their digits is equal to the given number.       Sample Input   2    4      Sample Output   5    13 
 Have you ever played Minesweeper? It’s a cute little             game which comes within a certain Operating System which name we can’t really             remember. Well, the goal of the game is to find where are all the mines within a             MxN field. To help you, the game shows a number in a square which tells you how             many mines there are adjacent to that square. For instance, suppose the             following 4x4 field with 2 mines (which are represented by an * character):   *…   ….   .*..   ….       If we would represent the same field placing the hint             numbers described above, we would end up with:   *100   2210   1*10   1110       As you may have already notice, each square may have             at most 8 adjacent squares.       Input:   The input will consist of an arbitrary number of             fields. The first line of each field contains two integers n and m (0<n, m<=100)             which stands for the number of lines and columns of the field. Each safe square             is represented by an “.” Character (without the quotes) and each mine is             represented by an “*” character (without the quotes). The first field line where             n=m=0 represents the end of input and should not be processed.       Output:   For each field, you must print the following message             in a line alone:   Field #x:   Where x stands for the number of the field (starting             from 1). The next n lines should contain the field with the “.” Characters             replaced by the number of adjacent mines to that square. There must be an empty             line between field outputs.       Sample Input   4 4   *…   ….   .*..   ….   0 0       Sample Output   Field #1:   *100   2210   1*10   1110 
 A paper cube can be made up from six paper squares.             Given an projection (map) of the cube, you are to determine its correctness. A             projection is correct, if a cube can be made up from it.        Input:   First line contains the number of test cases. Each             test case contains a projection represented as 6*6 grid containing 6 ones and 30             zeros, separated by spaces. 1s represent the paper squares. All squares are             placed immediately to each other, so that each square is connected with at least             one other square. Each test case is separated by an empty line.       Output:   For each test case, your program should print             “correct” if cube can be made up from the given projection, or “incorrect”             otherwise.       Sample Input   1   0 0 0 0 0 0   0 0 0 1 0 0   0 0 0 1 0 0   0 0 1 1 1 0   0 0 0 1 0 0   0 0 0 0 0 0           Sample Output   correct     
 Given a M by N grid of letters, (1<=M,N<=50), and a             list of words, find the location in the grid at which the word can be found. A             word matches a straight, uninterrupted line of letters in the grid. A word can             match the letters in the grid in the grid regardless of case (i.e. upper and             lower case letters are to be treated as the same). The matching can be done in             any of the eight directions either horizontally, vertically or diagonally             through the grid.       Input   The input will contain one or more test cases. The             first line of each test case begins with a pair of integers, M followed by N,             1<=M,N<=50 on a single line. The next M lines contain N letters each; this is             the grid of letters in which the words of the list must be found. The letters in             the grid may be in upper or lower case. Following the grid of letters, another             integer K appears on a line by itself (1<=K<=20). The next K lines of input             contain the list of words to search for, one word per line. These words may             contain upper and lower case letters only (no spaces, hyphens or other             non-alphabetic characters).The input will end with two zeroes for M and N.        Output                             For each word in the word list, output a pair of integers representing the             location of the corresponding word in the grid must be output. The integers must             be separated by a single space. The first integer is the line in the grid where             the first letter of the given word can be found (1 represents the topmost line             in the grid, and m represents the bottommost line). The second integer is the             column in the grid where the first letter of the given word can be found (1             represents the leftmost column in the grid, and n represents the rightmost             column in the grid). If a word can be found more than once in the grid, then the             location which is the output should correspond to the uppermost occurrence of             the word (i.e. the occurrence which places the first letter of the word closest             to the top of the grid). If two or more words are uppermost, the output should             correspond to the leftmost of these occurrences. All words can be found at least             once in the grid.

      When displaying a collection of rectangular windows, a             critical step is determining whether two windows overlap, and, if so, where on             the screen the overlapping region lies. Write a program to perform this             function. Your program will accept as input the coordinates of two rectangular             windows. If the windows do not overlap, your program should produce a message to             the effect. If they do overlap, you should compute the coordinates of the             overlapping region (which must itself be a rectangle).          All coordinates are expressed in "pixel numbers",             integer values ranging from 0 to 9999. A rectangle will be described by two             pairs of (X, Y) coordinates. The first pair gives the coordinates of the lower             left hand corner (XLL, YLL). The second pair gives the coordinates of the upper             right hand coordinates (XUR, YUR). You are guaranteed that XLL<XUR and YLL<YUR.       Input                                The             first line will have a number N (0<N<=100) with the number of test cases. Each             test case will consists of two lines each containing four numbers. The first             line contains the integer numbers XLL, YLL, XUR and YUR for the first window.             The second contains the same numbers for the second window.        Output   For each test case, if the two window do no overlap,             print the   Message "No Overlap". If the two windows do overlap, print 4             integer numbers giving the XLL, YLL, XUR and YUR for the region of overlap.              Note that two windows that share a common edge but have no other point in common             are considered to have "No Overlap".       Sample Input   2   0 20 100 120   80 0 500 60   10 10 20 20   30 30 40 40       Sample Output   80 20 100 60   No Overlap      
   Apple         Trees     Apple trees in a garden form a rectangular grid. A         group of monkeys lives on these  trees. Not more than one monkey lives in each tree. A         monkey feels happy to believe that it is  the lord of all apple trees it views from the top of         the tree it lives in. However, as the trees are  of different heights a monkey can view trees that are         not obstructed from its view by other  trees. A monkey that views the maximum number T of         trees is a lord of lords. The undisputed  monarch is the lord of lords that lives in the highest         tree. In case two or more lord of lords  have the claim to be the monarch then monarchy is         disputed.  Assume that the ground of the garden is plane;         vertical straight lines represent trees;  trees are at a distance of unity row-wise or         column-wise; and the height of each tree is an  integer in the unit of the distance. A tree of height         zero in a position indicates absence of a  tree on that position. Visibility of a tree R from the         top of a tree P depends on heights and  locations of P, R and other trees. A tree R is         invisible from the top of a tree P if and only if  there exists a visible tree Q that lies on the         vertical plane containing P and R and is located  between P and R so that the top of R is either on or         below, the line joining tops of P and Q.  Write a program to locate the undisputed monarch,         given heights of all trees.            Input  The input may contain multiple test cases.  For each test case, the first line gives two integers         m and n representing respectively  the total number of rows and columns of trees in the         garden. Each of the next m lines  contains n integers representing heights of trees in a         row. The jth integer in the ith row  represents the height of the tree in ith row and jth         column of the garden. Assume that the  garden contains no more than 200 trees.  The input terminates with an input 0 as the first         input for a test case.                 Output  For each test case output three integers r, c and T in         one line. Integers r and c  represent the location of the undisputed monarch,         where r is the row number and c is the  column number of the tree on which the monarch lives.         In case monarchy is disputed, both r  and c are zero. The integer T represents the total         number of trees visible to a lord of lords.

  Bio-HRQ-Comparator     Bio-HRQ-Comparator is a fully automatic         computer based neurological scanning  system that scans brains of three persons         simultaneously and ranks them 1, 2, 3 with respect  to their HRQ (Human Resource Quotient) for         a given activity. Bio-HRQ-Comparator has three  specially designed chairs each fitted with         brain scanning devise. Exactly three persons are to  sit on the chairs and just think         independently and simultaneously on the best possible solution  of a given problem related to an activity         for which HRQ is tested. The thinking process  continues for a specified duration of time         that is dependent on the complexity of the given  problem. Bio-HRQ-Comparator captures the         thinking process and ranks them with respect to  their HRQ without any further scrutiny.         Through rigorous testing and analysis, ranking by Bio-  HRQ-comparator has been found to be so         precise that no two ranked persons are identified  to have different rank order or found to         have the same HRQ.  The system has the potential to replace         the traditional method of selection of  candidates through interview, where the         basic problem is to arrive at total ordering and  ranking of a given set of n (assume n≤ 20)         candidates with respect to their HRQ for a specific  job. It is proposed to select arbitrarily         k sets of three candidates each and rank candidates in  each set using Bio-HRQ-comparator hoping         that total ordering and ranking of candidates can  be done successfully. However it is not         always possible to arrive at total ordering and ranking  of all n candidates using arbitrarily         selected k sets of candidates.  You are required to write a program that         either ranks all n candidates, if possible,  using the k results obtained so far or         determines the minimum number m of additional Bio-  HRQ-comparator testing required for         determining the total ordering and ranking of all n  candidates. In case m additional testing         are required, the program should identify m sets of  three candidates each, for additional         Bio-HRQ-comparator testing. Assume for simplicity that  a candidate is not required to appear more         than twice for additional testing.   Input  Input may contain multiple test cases.         Each test case contains two lines.  The 1st line gives n and a string of n         letters. Each letter in the string identifies a  candidate and letters appear in an         arbitrary order.  The 2nd line gives k results of         Bio-HRQ-comparator testing. The first field is the integer  k and it is followed by k strings of three         letters each representing k results. The three letters in  a string appear in order of ranks 1, 2 and         3 of candidates represented by the letters.  Input terminates with a line that contains         0 (zero) as the first and the only character.   Output  For each test case, print output in one         line.  The first field in the line gives the         integer m. If m is equal to 0 then a string of n letters  follows it; the string represents the         total rank order of all n candidates.  Otherwise m strings each of length three         follow the integer m. Each string contains  either three letters or two letters         followed by an asterisk (*). Each letter identifies a specified  candidate while an asterisk represents an         option to have any candidate. Letters in a string  appear in alphabetic order and strings         appear in lexicographic order.

           Alphabets                       You are provided a set of characters forming an alphabet, arranged in increasing         order of their weight. Write a program to sort a set of strings in ascending         order using the provided alphabet. The sorted output is to be displayed on the         screen.               Input:           First line contains the number of test cases. Each test case is separated by an         empty line. Each test case contains the following inputs:   Size of alphabet  Characters in alphabet  Strings to be sorted                Output:           For each test case, display the input strings in ascending order. Output of each         test should be separated by an empty line.               Sample Input           2           26           ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ           ABCD           ABCFX           ABCE                       26           ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA           ABCD           ABCFX           ABCE               Sample Output           ABCD           ABCE           ABCFX                       ABCFX           ABCE           ABCD 
           Fibonacci                       Recall the definition of the Fibonacci numbers:                       f1           f2           fnn-1+fn-2        (n>=3)                       Given two numbers a and b, calculate how many Fibonacci numbers are in the range         [a,b].               Input:           The input contains several test cases. Each test case consists of two         non-negative integer numbers a and b. Input is terminated by a=b=0. Otherwise,         a<=b<=10^100. The numbers a and b are given with no superfluous         leading zeros.               Output:           For each test case output on a single line the number of Fibonacci numbers fi         with a<=fi<=b.               Sample Input           10 100           1234567890 9876543210           0 0               Sample Output           5           4 
           Politics                       Leaders of N political parties agree to have a conference to resolve a political         issue through discussion. However due to animosity between parties and leaders,         some of the leaders may dislike sitting next to leaders specified by them. The         problem is to determine, if possible, sitting arrangements on the table, so that         a leader is not required to sit next to another leader disliked by him/her.         Leaders are identified by integers 1,2,..,N. It may be noted that if a leader         ‘i’ dislikes sitting next to another leader ‘j’, then the leader ‘j’ may not         necessarily dislike sitting next to leader ‘i’. However in such a case ‘i’ and         ‘j’ cannot sit next to each other because ‘i’ dislikes ‘j’.                       An arrangement is represented by a sequence of N integers 1,2,…,N indicating the         relative position of each leader. In case of more than one arrangement, the         arrangements are to be printed in lexicographic order.           Write a program to print all possible sitting arrangements for the conference.               Input:           The input may contain multiple test cases. The first line of each test case         contains the case number ‘c’ and the total number of leaders N where N will be         less than 100. Each of the next N lines contains N 0’s or 1’s. If the value in i^th         row and j^th column contains 1, then the i^th leader cannot         sit with j^th leader. This is true for all I,j=1,2,…,N. The input         terminates with a single 0 in the last line.               Output:           For each test case, print the case number ‘c’ and the total number of possible         arrangements ‘k’ in first line with a single space between them. Each of the         next k lines prints an arrangements in lexicographical order separated with a         single space.               Sample Input           1 5           11010           01001           00100           10010           01011           2 6           101100           010001           101000           100110           001011           010011           0   Sample Output           1 0           2 2           1 5 2 3 4 6           1 5 2 4 3 6 
           Palindrome                               A simple recursive method to generate a numeric palindrome from any         number is to reverse its digits and add it to the original. If the sum is not a         palindrome (which means, it is not the same number from left to right and right         to left), repeat this procedure. For example for 195:       195 + 951 = 786       786 + 687 = 1473       1473 + 3741 = 5214       5214 + 4125 = 9339         Resulting palindrome      In         this particular case the palindrome 9339 appeared after 4th addition. This         method leads to palindromes in a few step for almost all of the integers. But         there are interesting exceptions. 196 is the first number for which no         palindrome has been found. It is not proven though, that there is no such a         palindrome.               Your         task is to write a program that gives the resulting palindrome and the number of         iterations (additions) to compute it. All tests data in this problem will have         an answer, will be computable with less than 1000 iterations (additions), which         will yield a palindrome that is not greater than 4,294,967,295.       Input                                 The first line will have a number N (0<N<=100) with the number of test         cases, the next N lines will each have a number P to compute its palindrome.               Output                    For each of the N numbers you will have to write a line with the minimum         number of iterations (additions) to get to the palindrome and the resulting         palindrome separated by one space.     Sample Input  3  195  265  750     Sample Output  4 9339  5         45254  3 6666       
When         displaying a collection of rectangular windows, a critical step is determining         whether two windows overlap, and, if so, where on the screen the overlapping         region lies. Write a program to perform this function. Your program will accept         as input the coordinates of two rectangular windows. If the windows do not         overlap, your program should produce a message to the effect. If they do         overlap, you should compute the coordinates of the overlapping region (which         must itself be a rectangle).                       All coordinates are expressed in "pixel numbers", integer values ranging         from 0 to 9999. A rectangle will be described by two pairs of (X, Y)         coordinates. The first pair gives the coordinates of the lower left hand corner         (XLL, YLL). The second pair gives the coordinates of the upper right hand         coordinates (XUR, YUR). You are guaranteed that XLL<XUR and YLL<YUR.       Input                          The first line will have a         number N (0<N<=100) with the number of test cases. Each test case will consists         of two lines each containing four numbers. The first line contains the integer         numbers XLL, YLL, XUR and YUR for the first window. The second contains the same         numbers for the second window.               Output           For each test case, if the two window do no overlap, print the             Message "No Overlap". If the two windows do overlap, print 4 integer numbers         giving the XLL, YLL, XUR and YUR for the region of overlap.  Note that two windows that share a         common edge but have no other point in common are considered to have "No         Overlap".     Sample Input  2  0 20         100 120  80 0         500 60  10 10         20 20  30 30         40 40     Sample Output  80 20         100 60  No         Overlap          
                        A tourist came to Lahore to visit some cities but he         has short time to do so. He decided to go to Islamabad through a longest path so that he can visit         maximum area on his way to Islamabad.         Write such an algorithm which finds longest path between two cities.               Input                You will get the total number of cities         (0<city code<10).    You will be given two 2D arrays. First         row of the first array contains codes of those cities which are directly         connected to the first city. The second row of the first array contains codes of         those cities which are directly connected to the second city and so on.    In second array the distance between two         cities is placed at the            corresponding location as the destination city in the first array.           Single city should not be repeated in the longest path.   Output           The output will contain the path from source city to destination city           with maximum distance for each source         and destination city.   Sample Input           5 // number of cities           2 3 4                  // start of first 2D array           1 4 5           1 4 5           2 3 1           2 3           4 9 17                 // start of second 2D array           4 9 13           9 15 20           9 15 17           13 20           5 3                     // source and destination cities           1 4           4 3           0               Sample Output           5 2 1 4 3                 // path from city 5 to 3 with maximum distance           1 3 5 2 4           4 2 5 3 
           Array                       You are given a 2D array, initially equal to 0. The next input line contains an         integer with a Capital character H (Horizontal) or V (Vertical) or S (Square).                       You have to read a input line and follow the following criteria:  -                For every input, you have to start from the last row and first column of the         array. Start moving upward until you find an appropriate position to set the         input there. If you don’t find a position in that column, then move to next         column at the last row, and so on.  -                If the input line contains 2H, then at the position where you find two         horizontal elements containing 0, stop there and place 1 in those elements         positions.  -                If the input line contains 2V, then at the position where you find two vertical         elements containing 0, stop there and place 1 in those elements positions.  -                If the input line contains 2S, then at the position where you find two         horizontal and two vertical (a square of two elements) elements containing 0,         stop there and place 1 in those elements positions.  -                If you cannot find a position that fits the given input, simply ignore that         input.               Input                The first input line contains two         integers i.e. the size of the 2D array. The maximum size of the 2D array will be         25x25. The next lines contain input to be set in the 2D array. The input will         end on the line containing a single 0.                           Sample Input           8 8           2H           2V           3S           2S           2H           3H           0   Sample Output           11000000           11000000           11100000           11100000           11100000           11110000           11100000           11000000 
      Child’s Play     Anu is a little girl who has an extraordinary skill in playing with         numbers. You give her a set of nonzero  positive integers with or without repetitions and tell her to generate all         possible distinct nonzero positive integers  by retaining / adding / subtracting any combination of the given integers.         She can do so instantly.  For example if you give her the three integers 2, 8, 3 then in a moment she         will tell you that a total of 11  integers can be generated. In fact, the 11 integers are the following: 1,         2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 13.  You are required to write a program that equals the skill of Anu.   Input  The input may contain multiple test cases.  The first line of each test case gives two integers: the case number c and         the total number k (< 15) of  integers given to Anu. The next line gives k integers in any order. A blank         character separates two consecutive  integers in input.  The input terminates with an input 0 for c.   Output  For each test case print output in one line, giving the case number c and         the total number of integers that  can be generated.

 ACM International Collegiate     Programming Contest, Asia-Amritapuri Site, 2012 Denethor's Decryption of Dequeue permutations  'Though the Stewards deemed that it was a secret kept only by themselves, long ago I guessed that here in the White Tower,     one at least of the Seven Seeing Stones was preserved. In the days of his wisdom Denethor did not presume to use it, nor to challenge Sauron,     knowing the limits of his own strength. But his wisdom failed; and I fear that as the peril of his realm grew he looked in the Stone and was deceived:     far too often, I guess, since Boromir departed. He was too great to be subdued to the will of the Dark Power, he saw nonetheless only those things which     that Power permitted him to see.' - Gandalf.  Sauron and Saruman have been communicating from large distances using the Seeing Stones. Denethor, with great difficulty has been able to break into their channel of communication using his strength of will. Despite this however, it seems that their communication has been encrypted. Gondor's spies in Isengard have found out the encryption algorithm they use and have reported back to Denethor.  The algorithm is as follows : We refer to a dequeue as a double-ended queue. We define a "dequeue permutation of N" as a permutation of 1 to N that can be got by starting from a dequeue having elements 1, 2, 3, ..., N (in that order with 1 at the front and N at the back) and performing any sequence of N pop_front() or pop_back() operations.   Note that not all permutations of 1 to N are dequeue permutations. For example, with N = 3, you have 3-1-2, 1-3-2 etc. as dequeue permutations whereas 2-1-3, 2-3-1 aren't (you can't have 2 right at the beginning since its not at any end of the dequeue).  If Sauron wants to encrypt the number K and send it to Saruman, he would instead send the K'th lexicographically smallest (0-based indexed) dequeue permutation of N. That is, if Sauron wanted to send '0' to Saruman, he would just send 1-2-3-...-N (since this is clearly the smallest lexicographic dequeue permutation of N).  Sauron is transmitting the size of his army to Saruman, so that they can coordinate an attack on the Men of Rohan and Gondor. Since Sauron's will is so powerful, Denethor is able to get only vague glimpses of the numbers, and he is able to remember only the first half (floor(N/2) elements) of the permutation. Further, since these images are so vague, his understanding of the numbers happens out of order. For example, Denethor may understand that the 5th number of the permutation is 4, and later on only understand that the 3rd number was 3.   Help him estimate the minimum and maximum possible size of Sauron's army (value of K), given the number N, and incremental understanding of the first half of the permutation, not necessarily in order.  NOTE 1: Since the values to be output can be rather large, output the values modulo 1,000,000,007.  NOTE 2: It may be the case that Denethor's understanding of the permutation is flawed. If it is not possible to have a dequeue permutation satisfying all the conditions seen so far, output -1.  NOTE 3: A permutation p1 is lexicographically smaller than p2 if at the first position where they differ, p1's value is smaller than p2's.  Input (STDIN):  The first line consists of the integer T, the number of test cases. Each test case begins with a single integer N. This is followed by exactly floor(N/2) lines containing 2 integers each: i and j, denoting that Denethor has understood that the i'th element (1-based) of the supposed permutation is j.  Output (STDOUT):  For each testcase, output exactly floor(N/2) lines, one for each (i,j) pair. If the recollections till now cannot all be feasible, output '-1' on a line. Else output two space-separated integers: the minimum and the maximum possible value of Sauron's army, K, that are consistent with all the observations seen so far. Between successive test cases, there should not be any blank lines in the output.  Constraints:  1 <= T < 3  2 <= N <= 100,000 1 <= i <= floor(N/2) 1 <= j <= N All (i, j) pairs are distinct. And for two pairs (i1, j1) and (i2, j2), you have that i1 != i2 and j1 != j2.  Sample Input:   2 3 1 3 32 1 1 3 2 2 32 4 4 5 5 6 6 7 7 8 8 9 9 10 10 11 11 12 12 13 13 14 14 15 15 16 3  Sample Output:   2 3 0 73741816 536870912 805306367 536870912 805306367 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1  Notes/Explanation of Sample Input:   For the first test case, for N = 3, there are 4 dequeue permutations, lexicographically ordered as 1-2-3, 1-3-2, 3-1-2, and 3-2-1. Denethor sees the first number of the dequeue permutation as 3, and concludes that the permutation can be either 3-1-2, or 3-2-1. In the second test case, we see that (a) the 1st number is 1. (b) the 3rd number is 2 ... this means that the 2nd number has to be 32. (c) the 2nd number is 32 ... this does not add any new information. (d) the 4th number is 4. But this is not possible, since the 4th number can now either be 3 or 31.  Hence it is inconsistent (and none of the further observations can make it consistent). Also notice that in the 2nd test-case, the values have been output modulo 1,000,000,007. 
 Problem description. Sumit is enjoying his vacations alone in a 2D world (yes, he knows magic), until his GPS tracker stopped working. The great thing about his GPS tracker is that it sends the direction of his traveled path from the starting of his adventure to his best friend. Being his best friend, find Sumit's direction with respect to his starting position. It is sure that Sumit's final position doesn't coincides with his initial position.  Input  First line of input will contain an integer T , implying the number of testcases in the subtask.  Following T lines will contain distinct string S containing only following letters 'N' , 'S' , 'E' and  'W' , implying the four directions.   one of the example of the input string S is "NEWNEWS", which means that Sumit first moved one unit north and after moving one unit north he moved one unit to the east and after moving one unit to the east he moved one unit to the west ....so on and so forth....       Note:The directions are according to the geographical North , means if he moves EAST by one unit and after that again moves EAST by one unit, his final direction will be EAST (2 units) and  not  SOUTHEAST.  Output  For each test case, output a single line containing the final direction of Sumit. Output directions can be : "NORTH" , "SOUTH" , "EAST" , "WEST" , "NORTHEAST" , "NORTHWEST" , "SOUTHEAST" and "SOUTHWEST" .  Note:Only these 8 directions should be printed(without " ") and all letters should be uppercase.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ length of S ≤ 50   Example Input: 3 NEW NNSSE NE  Output: NORTH EAST NORTHEAST   Explanation move       Direction after move Testcase 1: N               NORTH E               NORTHEAST W              WEST  Testcase 2: N               NORTH N               NORTH(2 unit) S               NORTH(1 unit) S               NORTH(0 unit) , or, same as initial position.

 Problem Statement Bruce being very fond of Rachel, asks her out for 28th Feb, National Science Day. (Yeah! What a nerd :p) Not sure of her plan for the weekend, she asks him to do something extra-ordinary to prove his love. Rachel says "Bruce, today I want the Batman to be the Spiderman!".  Now given a vertical wall of NxM blocks, each block having some difficulty level. Batman has to climb the wall up from (0,0) to any block in the topmost layer. Not being as efficient as Spiderman, Bruce tries the greedy way out, from each block he can go up in any of the 3 available blocks (For any block the maximum possible blocks can be 3, diagonally left, just above and diagonally right), so he will always choose the block with the least difficulty. In case of two blocks with same difficulty, he always chooses the Leftmost one.   Batman can face a max difficulty of K units. Now your task is tell whether Bruce will get a date with Rachel or not.   Input   First line T, the number of test cases. Each test case consists of:  First line N M K, the dimensions of wall W and the Maximum difficulty Bruce can bear. Then a NxM matrix showing the difficulty levels of all the blocks. N lines each with M entries.  There will be a blank line after each test case   Output   For each test case print in a new line, "Yes" if he can climb the wall with given K tolerance.   print "No" otherwise.   Constraints    1 <= T <= 100  1 <= N, M <= 100  1 <= K  <= 10^18  0 <= W[i][j] <=10^9    Example Input: 2 4 3 9 2 2 1 2 3 2 3 1 5 3 2 1  4 3 7 2 2 1 2 3 2 3 1 1 3 2 1  Output: Yes No   Explanation Example case 1. from (0,0) difficulty=3, he will climb to (1,1) then to (2,0) then (3,0) incurring a total of 3+1+2+2=8 <9 so he will be able to impress her. :)   Case 2: But in the second case, it exceeds his limit. Note that He has to start frm the lower-leftmost block only.  
An old Gardner came to Little Vitaly's Garden and gave her a rooted tree T and an integer d. Each node of the rooted tree has a weight Ai. Each Ai belongs to a set of positive integers. Assume the tree is rooted an node indexed 1.  The old Gardner defines a path as a sequence of nodes  < v0, v1, v2, ..., vk >  where k ≥ 0. The weight of a path is the sum of node weights for all nodes in the path. Old gardner loves progressions and various kind of manipulations of mathematical series.   A path is said to be a geometric path if Depth(vi+1) = Depth(vi) + d^i .   A function f(u) is defined as sum of weight of all geometric paths starting from u. He asks little Vitaly to find sum of function f(u) modulo 10^9 + 7 for all nodes u where u belongs to [1, N].  The Depth of a node is the number of edges from the node to the tree's root node.    Note : Vi+1 has to be in subtree of node Vi.  Input  The first line of Input contains N and d denoting number of nodes and the ratio respectively. Next line contains N single space separated integers denoting the weights of the respective nodes.  Next N - 1 lines contain two integers  u and v denoting the edge between node u and node v.     Output  A single integer denoting sum of weight of all geometric paths.     Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 2 ≤ d  ≤  10 1 ≤ Ai ≤ 10^5  1 ≤  u , v ≤ N     Example Input: 6 2 2 4 8 16 32 64 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 6  Output: 466    Explanation Example case 1. The paths in the sample test case are - <1>, <2>, <3>, <4>, <5>, <6>, <1,2> ,<2,3>, <3,4>, <4,5>, <5,6>, <1,2,4>, <2,3,5> and <3,4,6>.   The sum of weights = 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + (2 + 4) + (4 + 8) + (8 + 16) + (16 + 32) + (32 + 64)     +  (2 + 4 + 6) + (4 + 8 + 32) + (8 +16 + 64) = 466.

   Background  During a plain crash every person died other than one. When he woke up he found himself in Bermuda triangle. No one was there to help him, but luckily he found a map of an archipelago in crashed plain’s garbage which consists of grid squares with characters, where '#' indicates land and '.' indicates water. Two land squares belong to the same island if they are neighboring grid squares, which means their x coordinates and y coordinates differ by at most 1. To escape from this island he have to find the near by island so that he can get back to his home. Help him to find the number of islands shown in the map.   Input:  The first line of the input contains a number which indicates the number of test cases to follow. Each test case starts with a line containing two numbers n and m, the number of rows and the number of columns of the grid, respectively.

  Energy Drinks  Chef has made an energy drink, where 1 bottle of drink gives a person energy to move a single step. He has organized a game in which at each step, a certain number of bottles are kept. The no. of bottles at each step represent the maximum no. of steps he can go forward from that position.You can’t carry bottles from one step to other i.e. if number of bottles at a step is 3 then you can drink 0, 1, 2 or 3 bottles, if you drink 3 you have to take a jump(move) of 3 steps, you can’t drink 2 bottles and carry 1 to the other step.If the no. of drinks at a step is 0, than he cannot go further. His motive is to reach his destination by optimizing his drinking in such a way that he has to make minimum no. of moves. The person knows the no. of bottles kept at each step. 1 move represents moving from 1 drinking position to the next.   Input:  The first line contains a positive integer T representing no. of test cases. Each test case begins with a single positive integer N representing the no. of steps from beginning to the final position including both. The second line of each test case consists of a group of non-negative integers separated by space, which represent the no. of bottles kept at each step.

 Background  Bob is a child who loves challenges. Once he went to a Labyrinth which was a net of paths. Tasks of labyrinth was to enter from one corner and come out from diagonally opposite corner. There were many confusing paths to complete this task, but Bob decided to pass labyrinth from the shortest path. Now your task is to help Bob by finding the shortest path from top left corner to right bottom corner of labyrinth.  Input:  First line contains number of rows(N) in Labyrinth, after this line, each of next N lines describe a row of labyrinth. There will be no more than 80 columns and no more than 80 rows and shape of labyrinth must be rectangular (not necessarily a square). Each position of the row is one of two characters. A '0' means you may move onto that position. A '1' means that space is occupied by a wall. You are allowed to move in any direction (up, down, left, right, diagonal) provided that the square you move into isn't a '1'. You always start in the upper left hand corner of the Labyrinth. The exit is always at the lower right hand corner of the labyrinth. There will always be at least one path from top left corner to bottom right corner.   Output:  The output is the shortest number of squares you must step in to pass through the labyrinth.

 Problem You are living in 2050, People do not work any more. Only surrogates (clone having same features & DNA characteristics)  work for every individual. Government is substituting man labor by surrogates. Every person can control his own surrogate from his home and paid for his services one of the criminal master mind hacked into Government system and started producing multiple surrogates for a single person in Dolgeville, a small town in Texas. These multiple surrogates released in Dolgeville by that criminal. So now it might happen that there are 6 identical person named Hugh F. Bumblebee: the original person and its 5 copies. The Federal Bureau of Unauthorized Surrogates (FBUS) charged you with the task of determining how many copies were made from each person To help you in your task, FBUS have collected a DNA sample from each person. All surrogates of the same person have the same DNA sequence, and different people have different sequences (we know that there are no identical twins in the town, this is not an issue).  Sample Input The input contains several blocks of test cases. Each case begins with a line containing two integers: the number of people(n) and the length of the DNA sequences(m). The next n lines contain the DNA sequences: each line contains a sequence of m characters, where each character is either 'A', 'C', 'G' or 'T'. The input is terminated by a block with n = m = 0 .  Output For each test case, you have to output n lines, each line containing a single integer. The first line contains the number of different people that were not copied for surrogate. The second line contains the number of people that were copied only once (i.e., there are two identical copies for each such person.) The third line contains the number of people that are present in three identical copies, and so on: the i -th line contains the number of persons that are present in i identical copies. For example, if there are 11 samples, one of them is from John Smith, and all the others are from copies of Joe Foobar, then you have to print '1' in the first and the tenth lines, and '0' in all the other lines.  Constraints Number of people(n) in input must be 1 &lt n &lt 20000 Length of the DNA sequences(m) 1 &lt m &lt 20  Example Input:  9 6 AAAAAA ACACAC GTTTTG ACACAC GTTTTG ACACAC ACACAC TCCCCC TCCCCC 0 0 Output:  1 2 0 1 0 0 0 0 0  
   Background  During the  Electricity cutoff in United States  this winter (caused by low leves of  the hydro dams), a  scheme was developed to turn off the Electricity to areas of the country in a particular sequence, totally fair, manner. The country was divided into N regions (LA  was region number 1, and NYC number 13). A number ,k, would be picked `at random', and the Electricity would first be turned off in region 1 (clearly the fair at starting point) and then in every k'th region after that, wrapping around to 1 after N, and ignoring regions already turned off. The problem is that it is perfectly fair to turn off  electricity of NYC in  last (because, the Electricity headquarters are situated there), so for a given N, the `random' number k needs to be carefully chosen so that region 13 is the last region selected. Write a code that will take a input number of regions and then find out the smallest number k that will ensure that NYC (region 13) can have electricity  while the rest of the country is in electricity cutoff.   Input In each line input consists of a integer N (greater than or equal to 13) and input will be terminated by a line containing 0.   Output  Output may have a single line or a series of lines, one for each line of the input. Each line will consist of the number k according to the above scheme.  Constraints  Number of regions (13<=N<=100)   Sample Input  17 18 0 Sample Output 7 17   
 Problem Michal Scofield  and Lincon burrow are two brothers. By a murder allegation Lincon Burrow  was sentenced to  jail. Michal Scofield  some how came to know that his brother is not guilty and he don’t have time to file case against the allegations as his brother is going to sit on death chair soon enough. So he made a plan for Prison break before handing himself over to police in a robbery allegation he made tattoos on his whole body a way of encrypting messages. He decided secretly on the number of columns and write the message (letters only) down the columns, padding with extra random letters so as to make a rectangular array of letters. For example, if the message is “There’s no place like home on a snowy night” and there are five columns, Michal would write down  t o i o y h p k n n e l e a i r a h s g e c o n h s e m o t n l e w x  Note that Michal Scofield  includes only letters in between the tattoos and writes them all in lower case. In this example, Michael used the character ‘x’ to pad the message out to make a rectangle, although he could have used any letter. Michael then tattooed them by writing the letters in each row, alternating left-to-right and right-to-left. So, the above would be encrypted as  toioynnkpheleaigshareconhtomesnlewx  At the time of the break he forget  something about encryption .Your job is to recover for Michal the original message (along with any extra padding letters) from the encrypted one.  Input The first line have a integer T number of test cases. Input for each test case will consist of two lines. The first line will contain an integer c indicating the number of columns used. The next line is a string of up to 200 lower case letters.  Output Each input set should generate one line of output, giving the original plaintext message, with no spaces.

One of the most fundamental concepts learnt by a novice programmer is generation of Fibonacci Series. The Fibonacci Series is known to be of the form 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13... etc. Usually a recursive approach to solve the problems is applied. The problem with the usual recursive approach is that multiple calls are made to calculate the same number, which makes it time in-efficient. This algorithm runs in time theta(n). However, if you use either a Dynamic Programming approach or Memoization Technique, we can develop an algorithm that computes the nth Fibonacci number using at most O(log n) arithmetic operations. Your task is to write a program, using Dynamic Programming or Memoization or otherwise that computes the nth Fibonacci Number in  O(log n). The series need not begin from 0 1. Problem Setter:  Input The input will contain the number of test cases 'T' an integer. The next 'T' line contain 3 unsigned integers A, B and N (in each line) where A and B are respectively the first and the second term of the Modified Fibonacci series and N is the Nth term to be calculated.  Limits are as follows - 0 < A, B, T     Output You have to print the Nth Fibonacci term for each test case in the new line.

Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) is the fourth revision in the development of the Internet Protocol (IP) and it is the first version of the protocol to be widely deployed. Together with IPv6, it is at the core of standards-based internetworking methods of the Internet. IPv4 addresses may simply be written in any notation expressing a 32-bit integer value, but for human convenience, they are most often written in dot-decimal notation, which consists of the four octets of the address expressed separately in decimal and separated by periods.  IPv4 Addresses have been divided into 5 classes as follows: Class A : 1.0.0.0 - 126.255.255.255 Class B : 128.0.0.0 - 191.255.255.255 Class C : 192.0.0.0 - 223.255.255.255 Class D : 224.0.0.0 - 239.255.255.255 Class E : 240.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.254 You task is to write a  program which takes an IP address as input and prints the Class to which it belongs. Problem Setter:  Input The input will contain the number of Test Cases 'T' where 0< T   Output You have to print the class of the given IP address in new line. Print 'Invalid' incase where the IP Address does not belong to any class.  Example  Input: 192.168.102.11 10.87.78.0 189.09.89.98 225.78.98.89 25.98.268.09 0.0.0.0  Output: Class C Class A Class B Class D Invalid Invalid 
Ancient Indian Mathematicians like Bhaskaracharya, knew the Pythagoras Theorem even before Pythagoras was born! Though they called it with a different name. They identified the theorem and used them widely as a set of 3 numbers a, b,c such that a*a + b*b = c*c. We'll call this set as 'TriMurthy'. TriMurthy contains 3 numbers which can be integer, decimal , positive, or even negetive). Any TriMurthy of the form a,b,c represent a right angled triangle which Base = a; Height = b; Hypotenuse = C. We find that cosA = a/c. Hence any TriMurthy represents an angle A. A 'TriMuthy' is called a 'Vishesh TriMurthy' if its elements are whole numbers and have no common factor. For example 3,4,5 and 24,7,25 are Vishesh TriMurhty, however, 6,8,10 is not a Vishesh TriMurthy (though is is TriMurthy)  because 2 is a common Factor.  Your task is to determine whether a TriMurthy is a Vishesh TriMurthy or Not.  Problem Setter:  Input The input contains 3 integers a,b,c in each new line. The number of test cases is not specified. Input Ends with End of File.  Output You have to print YES if a given TriMurthy is a Vishesh TriMurthy otherwise print NO for each set of a,b,c in new line.  Example  Input: 3 4 5 4 3 5 24 7 25 6 8 10 9 12 15  Output: YES YES YES NO NO  
Double Near Palindromes C-3PO is an expert in pretty much every language. His conversation with R2-D2 are always fun to observe un that R2-D2 speaks in Droid, C-3PO speak in English, and they understand each other perfectly! Anyway, humans and droids both enjoy playing word games. A palindrome is a word or sequence of one or more letters that reads the same forwards and backwards. A near palindrome is a word or sequence that can be changed to or kept a palindrome by changing exactly one letter to a different letter. For example, BAT is a near palindrome, since changing the T to a B would make the word a palindrome: BAB. PEEP is not a near palindrome: although PEEP is palindrome, changing any letter would remove its palindrome status.A double near palindrome is a word or sequence that consists of two near palindromes concatenated together. For example, BATMAN is a double near palindrome, since BAT and MAN are both near palindromes. Given a list of words, you are to determine which words are double near palindromes and which are not. Input The input consists of one or more words. All words (except the last) will be inclusively between 1 and 25 letters long and will consist of entirely of capital letters. The last word will be *END* and is not be processed; it simply indicates the end of the input. There may be any number of spaces and characters before, after, and between words. Output The output cases are to appear in the same order in which they appear in the input. For each input case, you are to print either w is a double near palindrome. or w is not a double near palindrome. whichever is appropriate, where w is the input word. Exactly one should follow each output case (meaning there should be no blank lines in the output).  Sample Input: BATMAN CONSTANTINOPLE *END*  Sample Output: BATMAN is a double near palindrome. CONSTANTINOPLE is not a double near palindrome.  Time limit : 1s Source limit: 50000B 
PRIME TRIPLES The theorem of Pythagoras was known long before Pythagoras (who lived c540 B.C.), the earliest statement of it being in the Indian Sulbasutras dated c800 B.C. The dimensions of Altars in India were based on Triples. Triples are sets of three numbers(integer, decimal , positive, negetive). Any Triple of the form a,b,c represent a right angled triangle which Base = a; Height = b; Hypotenuse = C. We find that cosA = a/c. Hence any triple represents an angle A. A Prime Triple is Triple if its elements are whole number and have no common factor. Forexample 3,4,5 and 24,7,25 are Prime Triples, however, 6,8,10 is not because 2 is a common Factor. Your task is to determine whether a Triple is Prime or Not. ©Vishal Gupta Input: Input contains a number of test cases. Each test case contains of one line containing 3 Integers a,b,c   Output: Print YES for Prime Triple and NO if non-prime triple.   Sample Input: 3 4 54 3 524 7 256 8 10   Sample Output: YESYES YES NO   
Tree   A fraction tree is an infinite binary tree defined as follows:   1.      Every node of tree contains a fraction 2.      Root of tree contains the fraction 1/1 3.      Any node with fraction i/j has two children : left child with fraction i/(i+j) and right child with fraction (i+j)/j 3.   For example, for a fraction tree up to 3 levels, we number the nodes according to increasing levels ( root is at level 1) and at any same level , nodes are numbered from left to right. So first node holds the fraction 1/1 , second one holds 1/2 , third one holds 2/1 fourth one holds 1/3 and so on. Your task is simple. Given a number n , you are to find the fraction at the nth node.   Input: Every line of the input contains a single number n. You are to find the fraction at nth node of fraction tree. Input file terminates with a 0 which is not to be processed.  Output: For each input ,  print numerator and denominator of the lowest form of the fraction seperated by a / Output of each case to be done in seperate lines.   Sample Input: 1 2 3 7 0   Sample Output: 1/1 1/2 2/1 3/1   Constraints : 1<=T <=30000 1<=N<=10^10   
The IP Address Class defines the number of networks and IP addresses that are available to an organization for use. An IP Address is comprised of 32 bits (4 octets)  of information. The IP address is working with two pieces of information: the network ID and the host ID. Based on the number of network and hosts the IP Addresses  have been divided into different classes – A, B, C, D & E.  Currently the NetTech team is conducting its certification course at BIT Mesra. Ayush Kedia  is a first year student and has little knowledge of networking. However the test is coming up and he needs your  help to top the list. He has a list of IPs which has to be classified based on the IP Addresses. Your job is to write a program that will print the class of the given  IP Address. Problem Setter: Vishal Gupta  Input: The input contains a series of IP addresses, each beginning in a new line.   Output: For each IP Address print the class of the IP Address each in a single line. Print ‘Invalid’ for any invalid entry.   Input: 192.168.102.11 10.87.78.0 189.09.89.98 225.78.98.89 25.98.268.09 0.0.0.0  Output: Class C Class A Class B Class D Invalid Invalid  
 If a positional numeral system is used, a natural way of multiplying numbers is taught in schools as long multiplication, sometimes called grade-school  multiplication: multiply the multiplicand by each digit of the multiplier and then add up all the properly shifted results. It requires memorization of the  multiplication table for single digits.  This is the usual algorithm for multiplying by hand in base 10. Computers normally use a very similar shift and add algorithm in base 2. A person doing long  multiplication on paper will write down all the products and then add them together; an abacus-user will sum the products as soon as each one is computed.  Your task is to write a program that multiplies two arbitrary precision signed integers.  Note that for this particular problem the only allowed languages are C &  C++.  p> Problem Setter:  Input First line contains number of test cases, integer n < 20.Each test contains two signed integers on two lines of arbitrary length. Number of digits of the arbitrary  precision integers may extend upto 1000000.  Output: You need to print the sum of the two arbitrary precision signed numbers.   Sample Input: 3 -123456789987654 -9876543210 -7894561230123 1234567890 42134134710293471092734 812374198273491872435034  Sample Output: 1219326320880960097529340 -9746371800348756550470 34228683905221964318944087115419517161404442956   
Reference:: The Hobbit : Desolation of Smaug      'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit:_The_Desolation_of_Smaug'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit:_The_Desolation_of_Smaug   J. R. R. Tolkien decided to make Thorin Oakenshield’s task more difficult.   This time he was given an infinite number of keys represented by a small   string. The hidden entrance has a lot of keyholes side by side represented by   one long string. The key fits only into a slit that matches it completely.   Oakenshield does not know how many keys he would require and which all   keyholes he will have to try out. So if there are n keyholes where the key   fits, he might need any number of keys between 1 to n (both inclusive).   Moreover he does not know which keyholes among the ones where the keys fit, he   will have to use. All he knows is that there is a unique way to open the door.   Trying out each configuration takes 1 second. The last light of Durin’s day   does not last long and will have to try out all possibilities before it goes.   He wants you to find out how long, in the worst case, it will take for him to   try out all possibilities.   Since the answers may be huge, output it modulo 1000000007.   If there are no keyholes where the key fits, output 0.   Input Format:    First line containing a string representing the key.   Second line containing a string representing the keyholes.   Output Format:    Single line containing an integer for the required answer.   Notes:    1. Key fits into a keyhole at index i if key is a substring of keyhole string   at index i.   2. If there are two overlapping keyholes where the key may fit, you cannot   insert a key in both simultaneously   Constraints:    1 ≤ key ≤ 10^4   1 ≤ keyholes ≤ 5*(10^5)   Sample Input:  c a Sample Output:  0 Sample Input:  aba abababa Sample Output:  4 Explanation: Explanation for Test Case #1:   The key fits into keyholes at positions {1, 3, 5}   If he requires only 1 key he may put them at {1} or {3} or {5} = 3 seconds.   If he required 2 keys, he may put them at {1,5} = 1 second.   Total = 1+3 = 4 seconds.   He cannot use 3 keys without overlapping them.   Explanation for Test Case #2:   There is no slit where the key fits hence 0 seconds.  Problem Setter: Vidit Gupta 
Utkarsh was recently setting a problem on trees. So he wanted to generate trees of N nodes by his program using the following procedure.  All the nodes are aded one by one to the tree. 1 is added first as the root of the tree. 2 is added and 1 is made the parent of 2. For every node i which is to be added next, one of i-1 or i-2 is seleclted randomly (eqiuprobably) and is made the parent of i.   He now wants to know the Expected Height of this tree. Height of a tree is the maximum number of edges on the path from root to any node of the tree.  Input  The first line conatins the number of test cases T. T lines follow. Each line contains the number of nodes in the tree N.   Output  For each test case print the Expected Height of the tree. Your output should have at most 10^-6 absolute error.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10^6 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6   Example Input: 2 2 3  Output: 1.000000 1.500000  Explanation There is only one tree possible {1-2} with height = 1 Two trees are possible: {1-2,1-3} with height = 1, {1-2,2-3} with height = 2. Therefore Expected height = 1.5 
You are given a rooted tree with N nodes rooted at node 1. Each node v is associated with two numbers Capacity Cv and Profit Pv. Your task is to select a subset S = {s1, s2,....sk} of nodes of this tree, such that the value Q = Ps1 + Ps2+.....+ Psk is maximized. Also, for any node v of the tree, there should not be more than Cv nodes from sub tree rooted at v in S.  Input The first line of input contains a number N, denoting the size of the tree. Next N lines contains 2 space separated integers each representing the value Ci and Pi.  Next N - 1 lines follow. Each of the next N - 1 lines contain 2 space separated integers x and y denoting the edge between node x and node y.  Output Output in one line a single integer denoting the maximum value of Q.  Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ Cv ≤ N 1 ≤ Pv ≤ 10^9     Example Input: 5 2 1 2 5 1 1 2 4 1 10 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5  Output: 15  Explanation S = {2,5} 
You are given a matrix with N rows and M columns. Cell (x, y) indicates the cell at the intersection of x^th row and y^th column. Each cell of matrix contains some assigned value (say H). Visiting this cell, you will get H dollars (if H ≥ 0) else you have to pay |H| dollars. You start from cell (1, 1) and you have to reach cell (N, M). From a given cell, you can only move right or down. Formally, from cell (x, y), you can go to cell (x + 1, y) i.e down or cell (x, y + 1) i.e. right. In your way you have to collect maximum amount of money. However, there is a trick to mend the rule. You can pay P dollars and change the direction of at most 1 move i.e. instead of going down or right, you can pay P dollars and go to left or up. [cell (x - 1, y) or cell (x, y - 1) from cell (x, y).] After you use this trick once, you will again have to start moving from one cell to another cell in your old way (right or down). Visiting a cell previously visited will cause no more gain or loss in money since you already have collected or paid for this cell before. Given the amount present on each cell of matrix and the value of P, find the maximum money you can get while travelling from (1, 1) to (N, M). You cannot move out of grid during any of your moves.  Input The first line of each test file contains three space separated integers N, M and P denoting rows and columns of the matrix respectively. Next N lines follow, each contains M integers. The j^th integer on the i^th line indicates the amount of money in cell (i, j).  Output Output in a single line, an integer that represents the maximum amount of money you can collect. In case you are in loss (negative collection of money), print the minimum amount of loss (with negative sign to indicate loss).  Constraints  1 ≤ N, M ≤ 10^3 -10^6 ≤ Amount in each cell ≤ 10^6 1 ≤ P ≤ 10^5     Example Input: 3 3 1 1 3 1 5 3 5 2 1 1  Output: 18  Explanation Example case.We will choose the path (1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 2) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (3, 3). Total money gained during the path is 1 + 5 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 5 + 1 = 19. Since you went up on cell (2, 2), you pay 1 dollar. So final total profit is 18 dollars. 
Utkarsh recently found an array A and a special function F(A). Function F takes input an array and gives the sum of Xor Sum of all the subsequences of the array. Utkarsh now wants to calculate the value of function F for some sub arrays of A. He also wants to change some values of array A. So Utkarsh has Q queries. Each query can be one of 2 following types.  1 L R : Tell the value of F( A[L..R] ). As the answer can be large, print it modulo 10^9+7. 2 V X: Make A[V] = X.  NOTE:  Xor Sum of a sequence {a1,a2,..an} is defined as a1^a2^...^an. ^ denotes bitwise Xor operation.  Sequence B is a subsequence of sequence of C if B can be created by deleting some elements of C.   A[L..R] denotes the subarray containing AL, AL+1 ,.., AR.  Array A is 1-indexed.    Input  The first line contains two integers N and Q. N is the number of elements in array A. Q is the number of queries. Next line contains N integers denoting the array A. Next Q lines contains the description of the queries. Line starting with 1 denotes query of first type. The line will contain 2 more integers L and R. Line starting with 2 denotes query of second type. The line will contain 2 more integers V and X.   Output  For each query of type 1 print the result F( A[L..R] ) mod 10^9+7   Constraints  1 ≤ N, Q ≤ 10^6 1 ≤ Ai , X ≤ 10^9 1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ N 1 ≤ V ≤ N   Example  Input: 3 4 1 2 3 1 1 3 2 3 2 2 1 2 1 1 3  Output: 12 8  Explanation For first query answer = 1 + 2 + 3 + 1^2 + 1^3 + 2^3 + 1^2^3 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 12 For last query answer = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 + 2^2^2 = 2 + 2 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 = 8 
At the ACME University, as part of the Graduate course work, each student is required to undergo project work. The authorities always make an effort to find a match among the students’ interests and the interests of the faculty members. First, they take a list of topics from the students' and a list of topics from the faculty. In order to avoid identifying students and faculties, all they preserve is simply, two consolidated lists of topics – one from the students and one from the faculties. No personal identification exists within these lists. The lists are sorted in ascending order of the indices of project topics in the repository. No topic appears twice in the same list. To make the process simple, ACME University maintains a repository of 100 project topics - numbered from 1 to 100, inclusive. The students and faculty members must choose among those topics only. Their lists may have different number of topics; since more than one student (or faculty) may choose to work work on the same topic or some may like to work on multiple topics etc. Once these two lists have been obtained, the university tries to make them identical. The student’s list is modified to match with the faculty’s list. The modification may be via  inserting a new topic in the list deleting a topic from the list substituting a topic by another one  The university wants to do this with minimal number of modifications to the list as each modification needs one full day to be communicated and accepted by the students. It is assumed that the students do not disagree to any such modification. Write a program that accepts the lists from students and faculties and computes the minimum number of modifications that will require to be made to make the student's list identical to the faculty's list.  Input The input contains several test cases. The first line of the input contains the number T, the number of test cases. The first line in each test case contains the number M, the number of topics in the students' list. The second line contains M integers A1, A2 .., AM separated by single space characters. The third line in each test case contains the number N, the number of topics in the faculty's list. The fourth line contains N integers B1, B2 .., BN separated by single space characters.  Output Output T numbers, each on a line by itself, without any leading spaces or zeros. The number should be the minimum number of modifications that can be made to the students' list to make it identical to the faculty's list, for each respective test case.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ M, N ≤ 100 1 ≤ Ai, Bi ≤ 100 The list { A1 .. AM } has no duplicates. The list { A1 .. AM } is sorted in ascending order. The list { B1 .. BN } has no duplicates. The list { B1 .. BN } is sorted in ascending order.  Sample Input  2 4 1 3 5 7 2 4 6 3 1 2 3 2 2 3   Sample Output  4 1   Explanation In the first test case 1, 3, 5 and 7 should be deleted from the list and 4 and 6 should be inserted. But this can take 6 modifications. Instead, we can delete either two of the 4 topics from the students' list and substitute the remaining two by 4 and 6 respectively. This takes 4 modifications. 4 modifications is optimal for this test case. 
Raju and Rada planned a trip to Egypt inspired by the movie ‘THE MUMMY’, not a pleasure trip. They went to Egypt by plane. On plane they met a curator who works at the British museum. He gave them a map containing some interesting places in Egypt. After lots of discussion they decided to go ‘HAMUNAPTRA-The city of the death ‘ which contained huge number of pyramids and sand arts. At the earliest they reached HAMUNAPRA. They entered a pyramid .there was a huge door. Raju and radha failed to open the door. So they decided to go back. Bt radha find some words written on the walls of the pyramid. They referred the map given by the curator. It says arrange them in such a way that every word begins with the same letter as the previous word ends and write on the sand door will open. For example, the word ``proti'' can be followed by the word ``imhotep''. The task given to you guys is to write a computer program that will read the list of words and determine whether it is possible to arrange all of them in a sequence (according to the given rule) and consequently to open the door.  Input The input consists of T test cases. The number of them (T, equal to about 500) is given on The first line of the input file. Each test case begins with a line containing a single integer number N that indicates the number of plates (1 <= N <= 100000). Then exactly N lines follow, each containing a single word. Each word contains at least two and at most 1000 lowercase characters. The same word may appear several times in the list.  Output Your program has to determine whether it is possible to arrange all the plates in a sequence such that the first letter of each word is equal to the last letter of the previous word. All the plates from the list must be used, each exactly once. The words mentioned several times must be used that number of times. If there exists such an ordering of plates, your program should print the sentence "The journey continues.”. Otherwise, output the sentence "Journey ends here.".  Example  Input: 3 2 anak sunamum 3 suyathuo lordevys orphanx 2 hmm hmm  Output: Journey ends here. The journey continues. Journey ends here. 
 A fraction a/b is called in its lowest form if gcd(a, b) = 1. It is possible to express a/b using the sum of a finite number of reciprocals of natural numbers. For example, 2/7 can be written as 1/4 + 1/28. Such a representation is called an Egyptian fraction representation of a/b. For each fraction, there could be multiple Egyptian fraction representations.  Let two sets of reciprocals be (p1, p2, ..., pn) and (q1, q2, ..., qk). We say, the first is lexicographically lesser than the second if there is some m, 1 ≤ m ≤ min(n,k) such that,  p1 = q1, p2 = q2, ..., pm-1 = qm-1 and pm ≤ qm.  Given a set of fractions in the lowest form, the problem is to generate the lexicographically least Egyptian fraction for each input fraction.  Input  The input consists of several lines, each line consisting of a pair of numbers separated by a blank space. The end of the input is signaled by a line containing the pair of numbers 1 and 1. Each pair on a single line will be positive numbers, co-prime to each other (except for the last line). The first number on any line is always less than or equal to the second number on the line.  Output  For each pair of numbers a and b on a line, output a sequence of numbers, representing the denominators of the lexicographically least Egyptian Fraction of a/b. The denominators should be sorted in ascending order. There should be a blank space separating one denominator from the next. You should NOT output the Egyptian Fraction representation of the last line, representing 1/1 = 1.  Sample Input  1 4 2 7 5 9 1 1   Sample Output  4 4 28 2 18  
Recently, Aparna and Surya were extremely excited by use of linear algebra in natural language processing. They realized that linear algebra was the key to many information retrieval algorithms as mentioned by their professor or otherwise. So one night, they went to the library to explore further.   Surya suddenly posed a seemingly random question. He asked Aparna, assume I have a graph of n vertices and m edges. Now if I construct a symmetric matrix; he flirtatiously adds (as he always does), I like symmetry cause knowing one half you can get the other, just like the two of us. He continues, "I will define the (i,j) entry as follows: M(i,j) = 1 if degree(i)!=0 and i=j M(i,j) = -1/sqrt(degree(i)*degree(j)) if i vertex i is adjacent to j in graph I give M(i,j) = 0 otherwise.  He then says, I will now calculate the eigenvalues of this matrix. Can you tell me if the difference between the largest eigenvalue and the second smallest eigenvalue is at-least 2.  Surya quickly realized he has to get out an eigenvalue decomposer. Both sit and started to code, while Siddhartha approaches them with his MATLAB code. Your task is to answer Surya's question before Siddhartha does so that you can score some brownie points ;)   Input Input description.  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers N, M denoting the number of vertices and edges. Then M lines follow. the ith line describes the ith edge. It contains two space separated integers u and v. Note the vertices are 0-indexed.     Output Output description.  For each test case, output a single line containing "YES" if the difference in largest eigenvalue and second smallest eigenvalue is at-least 2. "NO" otherwise. (Quotes for clarity. Do not print them)     Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 20 3 ≤ N ≤ 500 1 ≤ M ≤ N*(N+1)/2  For floating point calculations, ignore decimal point rounding upto 10^-6     Example Input: 1 3 3 0 1 0 2 1 2  Output: NO    Explanation Example case 1. The matrix as per the specifications is 1 -0.5 -0.5 -0.5 1 -0.5 -0.5 -0.5 1 The eigenvalues are 0,1.5,1.5 . Hence the difference between largest eigenvalue and second smallest eigenvalue is 1.5 - 1.5 = 0. which is strictly less than 2. Warning Input text files contains large I/O. Consider using faster I/O techniques. 
There are N cities in the country and some of them are connected by bidirectional roads. To handle any emergency situation, they need a emergency cell to be set up at some cities such that, in case of any emergency in a city, the fire engine, the ambulance etc., can reach that city. Setting up a emergency cell is expensive and as occurrence of a emergency situation is very rare, its just enough to have each city connected ( possibly through other cities, by a path ) to a city which has an emergency cell. Given the cost to setup emergency cell in each of the cities and the map of the country, find the minimum amount of money government needs to spend. In other words, the Government needs to select a set of cities S to set up emergency cells such that, every city in the country is connected to at least one city in S.  Input  The first line contains the number of test cases T. T cases follow. Each test case starts with a line containing N M, N is the number of cities numbered 1 to N and M is the number of bidirectional roads. Next line contains N integers, the ith integer is the cost of setting up emergency cell in the ith city. Each of the next M lines contains, x y , meaning x and y are directly connected by a bidirectional road. There can be multiple roads between a pair of cities and some roads may even connect a city with itself.  Output Output T lines, one for each case containing the required answer.

On New Year's Eve, in a quiet air traffic monitor's tower, the poor controller realised that he was going to be working at midnight as well. Being a superstitious person, he believes that wishing at least k people at midnight will bring him good luck for the rest of the year. He decides to broadcast a happy new year message to the planes passing by, but wants to broadcast this message only once, and only for the minimum possible radius that will accomodate k planes. Please help this eccentric man. All planes travel at uniform speed in a straight line.  Input  The first line of the input contains two integers N and K separated by a space character.( 0 < N < 10000 , 0 < K < 10000) ) N is the total number of planes. K is the number of planes the controller wants to wish. Each of the next N lines contain four integers x1, y1, x2, y2 separated by a space character. ( -2000 < x,y < 2000) x1 and y1 represent the initial coordinates of a plane (at time zero), while x2 and y2 represent the co-ordinates of the plane after 1 second.   Output  On the first line, output the minimum radius required to reach k planes, accurate to two decimal places. On one line, output a single integer, which shows the number of seconds after which the message is to be broadcasted.  Example  Input: 5 3 0 1 2 3 1 0 0 1 1 2 2 0 1 2 3 2 1 3 4 2  Output: 2.24 0  
 Dexter is the manager of Miami Wildlife Sanctuary. During rains, many species find it difficult to survive, so he decided to erect a large shed in the Sanctuary (a rectangular field) to protect these species. However, there are a number of trees on this land and Dexter does not wish to cut any of them.  Here is a description of Sanctuary as a rectangular grid where "." indicates the absence of a tree and " T " indicates the presence of a tree.  . . . . . T . . . T . . T . . . . . . . . T . .

Your task is to help Dexter determine the area of the largest shed he can put up without cutting any trees.  Input format The first line of input contains two integers M and N indicating the dimensions of the Sanctuary. This is followed by M lines of input, each containing N letters each of which is a "." or a "T".  Output format The output consists of a single line with a single integer indicating the area of the largest square shed that Dexter can put up in Sanctuary without cutting any trees. Also return -1 if not possible to erect the square shed.  Constraints You may assume that M ≤1000 and N ≤1000 in all inputs.

  The Restaurant was starting to fill up as Debra Morgan walked in. She scanned the crowd for her sister, brother-in-law, and nephew. Seeing her sister waving from the far end of the restaurant, she made her way back to their booth. “Hi, Debra”, her sister and brother-inlaw, Astor and Quinn Chapman, greeted her.  “Hi, guys”, she replied. “What are you doing, John?” she asked her nephew. He was busy working on one of the restaurant's activity sheets with a crayon.  “I'm doing a word search game,” John explained. “I have to find all of these words in this big mess of letters. This is really hard.” John looked intently at the paper in front of him.  “Can I help?” asked Debra, looking across the table at the activity sheet.  “Sure. These are the words we're looking for. They're the names of different kinds of Planes, Trains, and Automobiles.”  Input The first line of input will specify the length of the sides of the letter matrix (the matrix of letters will be square). The length, l, will be in the range 1 ≤ l ≤ 100. The next l lines of input will be the matrix itself, each line will contain l uppercase letters. A list of words will follow. Each word will be on a line by itself; there will be 100 or fewer words. Each word will be 100 or fewer characters long, and will only contain uppercase letters.  The final line of input will contain a single zero character.  Output Your program should attempt to find each word from the word list in the puzzle. A word is “found” if all the characters in the word can be traced in a single (unidirectional) horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line in the letter matrix. Words may not “wrap around” rows, columns or diagonals.  -Horizontal words may proceed from right to left (''backwards'') and vice versa.  -Vertical words may proceed upwards and downwards.  -Diagonal words may proceed from left to right (both upward and downward) but not in right to left direction.  For each word that is found, your program should print the coordinates of its first and last letters in the matrix on a single line, separated by a single space. Coordinates are pairs of comma-separated integers (indexed from 1), where the first integer specifies the row number and the second integer specifies the column number.  If a word is not found, the string “Not found” should be output instead of a pair of coordinates.  Each word from the input can be “found” at most once in the puzzle.  Sample Input 5 EDEEE DISKE ESEEE ECEEE EEEEE DISC DISK IEEE DISP 0  Sample Output 1,2 4,2 2,1 2,4 2,2 5,5 Not found  
 In the “Dancing Words” problem, we are concerned with words constructed using the lowercase letters  of the English alphabet - that is, a,b,c,...,z. These words need not necessarily be meaningful, any sequence  of letters forms a word. For example, abbcada is a word.  We say that we can "hop" from the word word1 to the word word2 if they are "sufficiently close". We define  word2 to be sufficiently close to word1 if one of the following holds:   - word2 is obtained from word1 by deleting one letter.  - word2 is obtained from word1 by replacing one of the letters in word1 by some letter that appears  to its right in word1 and which is also to its right in alphabetical order.  For example, we can hop from abbca to abca by deleting the second (or third letter). We can hop from aabca to abbca by replacing the a in the second position by the letter b that appears  to the right of the a in aabca and which is also to its right in alphabetical order.  On the other hand we cannot hop from abbca to aabca since we would need to replace the b  in the second position by a, but a is to the left of b in alphabetical order.  You will be given a collection of words W. Your task is to find the length of the longest sequence  w1,w2,w3…… of distinct words from W such that we may hop from w1 to w2, w2 to w3 and so on.  We call this the hopping number for this set.  For example, if W = {abacd, bcdada, dd, abcd,bcdd, adcd, addd, aa, ccd, add, ad}, then  the hopping number is 7 corresponding to the sequence abacd, abcd, adcd, addd, add, ad, dd  Input format The first line of the input contains one integer N indicating the number of words in the input.  This is followed by N lines of input, lines 2, 3,..., N+1, each containing one word over the letters {a,b,..., z}.  Output format The output should be a single integer, indicating the hopping number of the given set of words.  Test Data: You may assume N ≤ 100. You may assume that each word has at most 10 letters.  Example: Here is the sample input and output corresponding to the example discussed above.  Sample Input 11 abacd bcdada dd abcd bcdd adcd addd aa ccd add ad  Sample Output 7 
 Sam lives in a country "CoinLand" where there are n different types of coin. He wants to collect as many different types of coin as he can. Now if he wants to withdraw X amount of money from a Bank, the Bank will give him this money according to the following rule:  lets say sam needs to withdraw money 'x'.  1. if X=0 no money withdrawn. 2. Let Y be the highest valued coin that does not exceed X. Give the customer Y valued coin. Now he has to withdraw remaining X-Y amount. 3. go to step 1. this goes on until x becomes = 0.  Now Sam can withdraw any amount of money from the Bank. He should maximize the number of different coins that he can collect in a single withdrawal.    Input  Each of the test cases starts with n (1≤n≤1000), the number of different types of coin. Next line contains n integers C1, C2, ... , Cn the value of each coin type. C1 < C2 < C3 <  …  < Cn < 1000000000.  C1 equals to 1.Terminate the input with n=0.    Output For each test case output one line denoting the maximum number of coins that Sam can collect in a single withdrawal. He can withdraw infinite amount of money from the Bank.  Example  Input: 6 1 2 4 8 16 32 6 1 3 6 8 15 20 0  Output: 6 4 
factorizations of a positive integer n is a collection of at least two positive integers, each larger than one, whose product is n. Note that, 2*12 and 12*2 represent the same factorization of 24. In fact, 24 has precisely 6 valid factorizations: 2*2*2*3, 2*2*6, 2*3*4, 2*12, 3*8, and 4*6. so you have to write a program that, given an int n, returns the number of unique factorizations of n.   Input Input will have number of cases. each case having n. n will be between 2 and 2,000,000,000 inclusive. Terminate the input with n=0.   Output for each input, output the number of unique factorizations for that number.    Example  Input: 24 9973 9240 1916006400 0 Output: 6 0 295 7389115   
The Problem is simple. You will be given n integers .Find an arrangement of these n integers so that summation of the absolute differences between adjacent elements is maximized. Suppose n = 4 and the given integers are <4 2 1 5>. The re-arrangement <2 5 1 4> yields the maximum summation. For this arrangement, sum = abs(2-5) + abs(5-1) + abs(1-4) = 3+4+3 = 10. Of all the 24 different arrangements of the above list, you won’t get any summation whose value exceeds 10. We will call this value, 10, the "Interesting list sum".    Input The Input will consist of number of test cases. Each case consists of a line that starts with n. n will be greater than 1 and smaller than 51, followed by n non-negative integers separated by a single space. None of the elements of the given list will exceed 1000. Terminate the input with n=0.   Output For each case, output the "Interesting list sum".   Example  Input: 4 4 2 1 5 4 1 1 1 1 2 10 1 0 Output: 10 0 9 
We knows about base->2 (binary) integers and base->10 (decimal) integers, and various other positive bases. But what about negative bases. OK! lets talk about the "base-> -2". An integer n written in base -2 is a sequence of digits written right-to-left. Each of which is either 0 or 1 (no negative digits!), and the following equality must hold: n = b0 + b1(-2) + b2(-2)2 + b3(-2)3 + ... The cool thing is that every integer (including the negative ones) has a unique "base-> -2" representation, with no minus sign required. Your task is to find this representation.    Input The Input consists of the number of test cases. Each one is a line containing a decimal integer n, in the range from -1,000,000,000 to 1,000,000,000, excluding 0. Terminate the input with n=0.    Output For each test case, output one line containing base -2 representation of the input number.    Example  Input: 1 7 -2 0  Output: 1 11011 10  
You are Given a 2-dimensional array of positive and negative integers, find the sub-rectangle with the largest sum. The sum of a rectangle is the sum of all the elements in that rectangle. The sub-rectangle with the largest sum is referred to as the Best sub-rectangle. A sub-rectangle is any contiguous sub-array of size 1*1 or greater located within the whole array. As an example, the maximal sub-rectangle of the array:                              0  -2  -7  0 		 9   2  -6  2 		-4   1  -4  1 		-1   8   0 -2  is                              9  2 		-4  1 		-1  8   which is in the lower-left-hand corner, and has the sum of 15.    Input The input consists of several test cases. The input begins with a single positive integer N on a line by itself indicating the size of the square two dimensional array. This is followed by Integer values for the square. These integers make up the array in row-major order (i.e., all numbers on the first row, left-to-right, then all numbers on the second row, left-to-right, etc.). N may be as large as 100. The numbers in the array will be in the range [-127, 127]. Terminate the input with N=0.   Output The output is the sum of the maximal sub-rectangle.   Example  Input: 4 0 -2 -7  0 9  2 -6  2 -4  1 -4  1 -1  8  0 -2 0 Output: 15  
You are building a two way,triangular ladder. The ladder has N levels, numbered 1 through N from top to bottom. You have 3 types of marbles a,b,c, and you've decided to use them in the following manner: Within each row, you will select the types of the marbles such that there is an equal number of marbles of each type used in that level. For example, consider the following two- "two way ladders":         a                   a      c   b              c   b   a   a   a         a   c   a  The ladder on the left is correct. Each row contains an equal number of marbles for each type of marble. The ladder on the right, however, is not correct because the third level contains an unequal number of a and c marbles. It is obvious that at each level k, you will have a row of exactly k marbles.   Input Every input will have 4 values. You are given an int N, N>0 and N ≤ 10 the number of levels in the ladder, and 3 different integers a, b and c, all greater then or equal to 0 and less then or equal to 50, representing the number of available marbles of the given type. Terminate the input with N=0.   Output Return the number of distinct correct ways to form the ladder. Two ladders are different if there is at least one position at which the two ladders have a different marbles. If it is impossible to create any ladder with the given marbles, return 0.   Example  Input: 2 2 1 0 3 2 2 1 3 2 2 2 0 Output: 3 0 36  
Sam has pencils of different lengths, that follow an order. If he has n pencils than their lengths are in increasing order starting from 1, for example: if he has 4 pencils then they are of length 1,2,3,4. Thus if he has n pencils, then he has exactly one pencil of each the lengths from 1 through n.   Input Each test case will contain an integer n(3<=n<=1000000), the number of pencils in sam’s collection.Terminate the input with n=0.   Output For each test case, output on a line the number of different triangles you can make with sam's pencils. Triangles X and Y are different if there is at least one pencil in X that is not in Y. A triangle has area strictly greater than 0.   Example  Input: 3 4 10 0  Output: 0 1 50 
Patterns and sequences always interests humans. So we brings to you quite an unusual Pattern. This pattern has the following properties:                        1   1   1   1   1   1   .                        2   1   3   1   .   .   .                          1   2   2   1   .   .   .                            1   1   1   1   1   1   .

The first and the last row are exclusively composed by ones. 3. Each set of four adjacent numbers,                                      A                                  B   C                                     D  satisfies the relationship B*C = A*D + 1 .The complete pattern can be determined by the values of the first column and this rule. The example above shows some of the first values of this pattern. You must have come to know your task, find the value of a position in the pattern, given the values of the first column. Input  The Input consists of several test cases. The first line of each test case is an integer value N given that N>2 and N≤1000, that specifies the number of rows of the pattern. The second line of each test case corresponds to a pair of integer numbers i, j, with i and j both being greater then 1 and also i is less than N and j is less than 100,000,000, i specify the row and j specifies the position in the row of the value to be reported. The last line contains N values, v1, v2,..., vN , with vi>0&vi≤1000, (for each row), that correspond to the values of the first element in each row. notice that v1 = vN = 1 . It is guaranteed that every described pattern contains only integer values. The end of the input is recognized by a number 0 in the place that should correspond to the number of rows of a pattern.   Output Each line of the output must give the unique integer value corresponding to the value in the position (i, j) of the pattern.   Example  Input: 4 2 3 1 2 1 1 6 5 9 1 1 1 1 2 1 0  Output: 3 4 
The Hostel LAN connection is to be laid down. Rooms in the Hostel lie all in a straight line. It is always desired to use minimum number of cable wires for this work and all the rooms receive the LAN service. A room can either get connected to main line or it can get connected to a room to its immediate let or right provided the latter room is already getting the LAN service. You are to write a program that determines the number of different combinations of the cable wires that is possible so that every room receives the service.  example for 3 rooms:    	M           M               M             / \         /                      \           1  2      1-2                1-2  M represent the Main center and 1 and 2 represents the rooms. In first, Main is connected to both. In second, Main is connected to 1 and 1 is connected to 2. In third, Main is connected to 2 and 2 is connected to 1.  Input Each line of input contains a positive integer N (N ≤ 40), the number of rooms.There is only one main supply. A value of 0 for N indicates the end of input which should not be processed.Terminate the input with a zero.    Output For each line of input you have to output, on a single line, the number of possible arrangements. Output will be less than 2^64 - 1.    Example  Input: 1 2 3 0   Output: 1 3 8  
A palindrome is a string of letters that is equal to itself when reversed. Given an input string, not necessarily a palindrome, compute the number of times you need to swap to transform the string into a palindrome. By swap we mean reversing the order of two adjacent symbols. For example, the string "mamad" may be transformed into the palindrome "madam" with 3 swaps: swap "ad" to get "mamda" swap "md" to get "madma" swap "ma" to get "madam"  Input The Input will have number of test cases. For each test case, one line of input containing a string of up to 100 lowercase letters will be there. Terminate the input with a 0(zero).     Output  Output consists of one line. This line will contain the number of swaps, or "Impossible" if it is not possible to transform the input string to a palindrome.  Example  Input: mamad asflkj aabb 0 Output: 3 Impossible 2  
Arunava has learnt to find the sum of first N natural numbers using the expression N(N+1)/2.But now Kartik Sir has asked him to find the sum of floor(N/2) for first N natural numbers where floor(X) is the greatest integer less than or equal to a given real number X.Arunava has not memorized any formula for this. So can you help him.   Input 1st line has an Integer T denoting the number of test cases Each test Case Contains: A single integer N on a new line denoting the number of natural number upto which it needs to be summed.    Output For each test case output a single line containing required sum as the output    Example  Input: 5 1 2 3 4 5   Output: 0 1 2 4 6    CONSTRAINTS: 1 ≤ T  ≤ 100000 1 ≤ N ≤ 10000 0 ≤ S ≤ 214783647   Explanation of the fifth test case N=5, The required sum is floor(1/2)+ floor(2/2)+ floor(3/2)+ floor(4/2)+ floor(5/2)=0+1+1+2+2=6 
Joy is very fond of ice-creams. The road from Joy's house to IEM is full of ice-cream parlors.So naturally on his way to college everyday he stops his bicycle by the road side to have the best ice cream and hence even though he starts early morning from his home he fails to reach college in time. It is campussing time now.Subhabrata sir has warned him of the severe actions that might be taken against him if he comes late there too.So he can't afford to be so careless anymore, but he can't give up his fascination for ice-cream either. So Joy has figured out that there is only a continuous part of the road that remains crowded and a huge rush occurs in the ice-parlors within that area only and hence choosing an ice-cream parlor within that area makes him loose time for college. Ice-parlors outside this area are pretty empty and there he can get his orders served very quicky and it won't hamper his time much. He already knows the the quality of ice-creams available at each of the ice-parlors from his experience of all these years. However it is difficult to know which particular part of the road will remain crowded the next day. But nothing much to worry, there is a new Radio station which gives traffic forecast. Every night he listens to that traffic forecast to know which one continuous part of the road will remain crowded the next day. So guys it's your turn to help Joy to have the best possible ice-cream and also reach college in time.  Input  1st line: an Integer N denoting the number of ice-parlors on the road. 2nd line: N integers from A1 to AN separated by a single space.Integer Ai denote the quality of ice-creams available at the ith ice-parlor on the road. Higher the value of Ai better is the quality of ice-cream. 3rd line: integer Q denoting number of days that joy checks the traffic forecast. Next Q lines:2 integers  Xi and Yi separated by a single space denoting the starting and ending of the region(both inclusive and staring from 1) that will remain crowded on the ith  day    Output Q integers one on each line: ith line contains an integer denoting the best possible ice-cream that Joy can eat on the ith day. If he can not buy any ice-cream print zero for that day.    Example  Input: 10 2 5 9 8 7 1 6 5 8 7 2 4 7 3 8   Output: 9 8    CONSTRAINTS: 1 ≤ N ≤ 200000 0 ≤ Ai ≤ 214783647 1 ≤ Q ≤ 100000 1 ≤ Xi ≤ Yi ≤ N    Explanation: N=10, On the first day if he selects an ice-cream parlor between 8,7,1,6 lying continuously at 4th,5th ,6th, 7th position respectively he will become late so he has to chose the best among the rest which is 9 lying at location 3. Similarly on 2nd day he can not chose between  9,8,7,1,6,5 lying from 3rd to 8th position. 
It is high time now, IT companies are hiring in huge numbers. Now that they have hired they need to form teams each containing exactly 2 members. No two members in the team have the same age. In any team, older is given the position of a Developer (D) and younger is given the position of a Tester (T). They have sorted all the members to form a list according to their ages (such that youngest in the list is the first). However even before forming teams they have assigned designations (D or T) to all the members in the list. Now it is your duty to tell whether it is still possible to form teams with the requirements stated above and also maintain the assigned designation of each of the persons.    Input 1st line: An Integer T denoting the number of test cases Each test Case Contains: A single line representing the list consists of only 'T '& / or  'D'    Output T lines each containing  'YES'  (if possible to form group) or  'NO'  (if not possible).   Example  Input: Input 2 TTDD DDDDDD   Output: YES NO  CONSTRAINTS  1 ≤ T  ≤ 20 1 ≤ length(list)  ≤ 1,00,000   
Samya and Utsav are good friends. Samya claims that no one can beat him in maths especially when it comes to dealing with numbers. So Samya throws a challenge at Utsav that he will be able to do any computation within a second however difficult it is. Utsav tells him a value of N and asks him to find the smallest number such that it is co-prime to all first N natural numbers,it is a composite number and it is a square free number.Surprisingly Samya really gives the answer within a fraction of a second for whatever N Utsav asks him to do. But Utsav is not so good at Maths.So he wants you to write a program for him so that ha can verify Samyas answer. Let's see if your program can do better than Samya's brain.  Input 1st line contain an integer T denoting the number of test cases.Each test case contains one line,an integer N   Output T lines each containing a single integer S as the answer   Input: Input 2 1 6   Output: 6 77   CONSTRAINTS:  1  ≤ T  ≤ 100000 1  ≤ N  ≤46000 1  ≤ S  ≤ 214783647   
The classical Mobius function µ(n) is an important multiplicative function in number theory and combinatorics. µ(n) is defined for all positive integers n and has its values in {-1, 0, 1} depending on the factorization of n into prime factors. It is defined as follows:  * µ(n) = 1 if n is a square-free positive integer with an even number of prime factors. * µ(n) = -1 if n is a square-free positive integer with an odd number of prime factors. * µ(n) = 0 if n is not square-free. Given N, find the number of tuples (a,b) with 1<=a<=N and 1<=b<=N, such that µ(a*b) = µ(a) * µ(b)  Input The first line of input contains a number T(1<=T<=10), the number of test cases. Then T lines follow, each containing a single number N(1<=N<=100000).   Output Output T lines, one line for each input, containing the number of tuples satisfying stated property.   Example  Input: 3 1 2 4   Output: 1 3 14  Explanation: In case of N=4, only the tuples (2,2) and (3,3) do not satisfy the required condition, the other 14 tuples do.  
IEM(International Energitic Medical Board) has received a sample of viruses. The sample contain exactly N types of virus. Each type is recognised by a unique value(So, N values are necessarily DISTINCT).IEM has also received some statistics forecasting the behaviours of the viruses.This provided mainly three ideas:- 1.The initial number of each type of viruses,I( in other words, initially all type of viruses have same count ie I ) 2.Information regarding Q days about the behaviour of viruses. For each day, they have given 3 integers X,Y and V which means ALL THE TYPES PRESENT in the sample whose values are in between X and Y(both inclusive) will have an increase in number by value V. 3.Information about the critical virus at the end of each of Q days. For each day, they provide one integer R which means if all the viruses (generated TILL THE END OF THAT DAY) are sorted, in ascending order of their values, then the virus at position R in the sorted list is termed as "CRITICAL VIRUS"(the starting position in the list is '1' ie the list has '1' based indexing) Scientists working at IEM need to know the TYPE-VALUE of the critical virus at the end of each day,but as they are too energitic, they cannot wait for Q long days to have the list of critical viruses.So, they are asking you to help them.     Input  1st line contains one integer N 2nd line contains N space separated integers which denote values associated with the types present in the sample(they are distinct) 3rd line contain I and Q separated by a spoace Each of the following Q lines will have exactly 4 integers X,Y,V and R separated by spaces. (the meanings of N,Q,X,Y,V and R are as described in the problem)    Output Output exactly Q lines corresponding to Q days.Each line should contain an integer denoting the type-value of the critical virus among the viruses generated till the end of that day. *NOTE:R has nothing to do with X,Y & V particularly on that day, rather it denotes the position in the whole sorted list of viruses generated upto that day. type-value of a virus is typically the value associated with its type. don't assume N values (defining N different types) initially given are some permutation of the numbers from 1 to N. the types which are not present in the sample, are need not to be considered during updating the sample...   Example  Input: 5 9 3 5 1 6 2 3 3 6 1 1 1 3 3 11 5 9 2 20   Output: 1 3 6   Constraints: 1 ≤ N ≤ 100000 1 ≤ type-value ≤ 2*10^9 1 ≤ Q ≤ 200000 1 ≤ I ≤ 10000 1 ≤ X ≤ Y ≤ 2*10^9 1 ≤ V ≤ 10000 1 ≤ R ≤ total_no_of_viruses_generated_at_that_time  
You're given an array 'a' of N distinct integers. Let's consider a triple ( i, j, k ), 0 ≤ i < j < k ≤ N-1. The sum of corresponding elements is equal to a[i]+a[j]+a[k].

The palindrome is a string that can be read the same way from left to right and from right to left. For example, strings "level", "5665" are palindromes, however the string "coder" is not a palindrome.  We define "Lucky String" if it has an even length and the first half of this string is equal to the second half of this string. Like "papa" is an easy string because the first half "pa" is equal to the second half "pa", however the string "adda" is not an easy string because the first half "ad" is not equal to the second half "da".  If you are given N length of palindrome string, what is the maximal possible number of characters/symbols in an "easy string" that can be obtained by removing and changing the order of characters/symbols in the palindrome?  Input:    The first line of the sample input contains an integer T - the number of test cases. Then, T lines follow.   Each line consists of a single integer N - the length of a palindrome.   Output:   For each test case output a single integer - answer to the problem.    Constraints:   • 1<=T<=10000   • 1<=N<=1000000000   Sample Input: 2 5 4  Sample Output: 4 4 
FINDING PREFIXES Homer: Marge, I just ﬁgured out a way to discover some of the talents we weren’t aware we had. Marge: Yeah, what is it? Homer: Take me for example. I want to ﬁnd out if I have a talent in politics, OK? Marge: OK. Homer: So I take some politician’s name, say Clinton, and try to ﬁnd the length of the longest preﬁx in Clinton’s name that is a suﬃx in my name. That’s how close I am to being a politician like Clinton Marge: Why on earth choose the longest preﬁx that is a suﬃx??? Homer: Well, our talents are deeply hidden within ourselves, Marge. Marge: So how close are you? Homer: 0! Marge: I’m not surprised. Homer: But you know, you must have some real math talent hidden deep in you. Marge: How come? Homer: Riemann and Marjorie gives 3!!! Marge: Who the heck is Riemann? Homer: Never mind. Write a program that, when given strings s1 and s2, ﬁnds the longest preﬁx of s1 that is a suﬃx of s2.  Input Input consists of two lines. The ﬁrst line contains s1 and the second line contains s2. You may assume all letters are in lowercase.  Output Output consists of a single line that contains the longest string that is a preﬁx of s1 and a suﬃx of s2, followed by the length of that preﬁx. If the longest such string is the empty string, then the output should be 0.  Example  Input: clinton homer  Output: 0   Input: riemann marjorie  Output: rie 3

Mirrored Strings Davy Jones needs to conquer a ship for his pirates. But the only rule he has to follow is to conquer only those ships whose names are partially mirrored at the end.  For Example: If a ship's name is 'abxyzba' then he can conquer the ship because the string has mirrored string at the beginning and at the end i.e 'ab'.  Now your job is to develop a programming code which helps Jones to identify the ships.  Input First line consists of input string of any length.  Output Second Line is the appropriate output displaying only the mirrored string.  Example  Input: abXYZba  Output: ab   Input: codechefdoc  Output: cod 
After reading the book Digital Fortress, one evil computer programmer was so inspired that he decided to steal information from the FBI servers themselves. He was able to create a virus, using polymorphic code mutations, just as it was written in the book, that even the FBI filters were unable to detect it. He knew about the FBI servers, that they were arranged in a X by Y grid. The virus was self-propagating, which means he have to release it to only 1 computer to affect the whole grid. The virus made complex hacks to break down firewall and other securities, and that too without raising any security alarm, so that it took almost 1 hour to break into a server. After it affects a server, it spreads to nearby servers adjacent to it and start hacking them, which takes another hour on their own:  Go fellow hackers! Given X and Y, It's our task to find the minimum time to shut down all the FBI servers.    Input The first line contains A, the number of test cases. Each of the next A lines contain two integers X and Y. A ≤ 1,000 0 ≤ X ≤ 10,00,000 0 ≤ Y ≤ 10,00,000    Output The minimum time in hours it takes to shut down all servers in the grid.   Example  Input: 2 3 1 3 3  Output: 2 3

A computer has a dual core processor. Its operating system has a set of jobs JS from an application that it has to execute. A job scheduled to a core runs on that core till its completion. The scheduler is optimized to schedule jobs to different cores such that at the end of execution of JS, the skew of the processing time between both the cores is minimum. For example if there are three jobs A, B and C requiring 2, 3 and 4 milliseconds each respectively, then the scheduler will assign the jobs A and B to Core 1 and job C to Core 2. In this case the skew is |(2+3) - 4| = 1. Yet another scheduling policy can be to assign job A to Core 1 and jobs B and C on Core 2 but in this case the skew will be |2 - (3+4)| = 5, which is not optimal because Core 1 will finish its job in 2 milliseconds and keep sitting idle for five extra milliseconds while Core 2 finishes its jobs in 7 milliseconds. Your task is to find the skew assuming that  the scheduler optimally schedules the jobs to different cores no other job gets allocated a time quantum while any job from JS is executing scheduling policy is non-preemptive   Input First line of the input is the number of test cases T, after which T test cases follow. Each test case begins with an integer n in a line, i.e. the number of jobs in JS; followed by burst times(in milliseconds) required for each of the n jobs in a single line with each value separated by single space.   Output For each test case output a single integer s, the skew for that test case; followed by a new line character.  Constraints  1<= t <= 10 1<= n <= 1000   Example  Input: 2 5 2 3 4 6 8 1 6  Output: 1 6

  Indian Institute of Technology, Banaras Hindu University is organizing an annual cultural festival. An organizing committee has been formed to get all the preprations done for the fest. The convener of the fest has decided to invite the American Band, Linkin Park to the institute. which in turn gets disadvantageous as the cost incurred in organizing a show increases with each day.   On day 1, today, the committee has to pay ‘A’ dollars in order to organize the show. After each passing day, the cost in organizing the show becomes A times the price on the previous day. Any normal person would invite them on the 1st day itself as the price will be the lowest but the problem with the committee is that it needs some time to get all the approvals for inviting the band. Therefore it needs ‘B’ days to get the approvals before making the band an offer.   You, being a part of the financial team of the fest have the responsibility to calculate the cost of organizing the show. Your task is to ask the Linkin Park team on the Bth day.

There us a story told by Richard Feynman in the book "Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman" where he describes inspecting a manufacturing plant. The plant has  N  chambers and  M  valves, each valve connects two chambers. The valves are  bidirectional , i.e., substance can flow in either direction through the valve. Substance is manufactured in chamber 1 and flows to chamber N, where is exits the plant. Due to it's explosive nature, the substance should not be allowed to accumulate. Hence the plant has the property that failure of a single valve cannot prevent substance flow from chamber 1 to chamber N. (Failure of a valve means that substance cannot flow in either direction through that valve). Feynman "accidentally" found a valve that violated the condition mentioned above. Can you?  INPUT : First line contains an integer T, number of test cases Each testcase starts with a line containing two space-separated integers, N and M M lines follow, each containing two space-separated integers A and B, indicating that there is a valve from chamber A to chamber B. Assume that it is possible for substance to flow from any chamber to any other in the input.  OUTPUT : For each testcase, print the total number of valves which violate the mentioned condition.  SAMPLE INPUT : 1 4 3 1 2 2 3 3 4  SAMPLE OUTPUT : 3  CONSTRAINTS : 1 <= T <= 10 1 <= N <= 100000 1 <= M <= 200000 
  In the year 4242, the language Haskell has evolved so much that it has become an AI. It can solve very challenging problems, in very little time. Humanity is worried that Haskell will take over the world. All hopes remain tied to the Competitive Programming community as they are the expert in shaving milliseconds off code runtime. Haskell creators have found one particular task that if solved faster than Haskell itself, can be used to hack into Haskell's codebase and thus defeat it. The exact details of the task are as follows,  " Calculate the sum, S(N, K) = , for Q queries. Here Fi is i^th Fibonacci number defined as: Fi = i if i = 0 or 1 and Fi = Fi-1 + Fi-2 if i ≥ 2. "  You being a member of the Competitive Programming community are encouraged to make a submission to this task.   Input  The first line contains a single integer Q, the number of queries. Each of the next Q lines contain two integers each, Ni and Ki.   Output  Output Q lines with one integer each. The i^th line should contain the value S(Ni, Ki).   Constraints  1 <= Q <= 5*10^4 1 <= N <= 10^18 1 <= K <= 10^18   Example Input: 1 1 1 Output: 1

Laurel Creek  Laurel Creek is a perilous river that divides the campus into two halves and contains dangerous inhabitants such as geese and beavers. Your task in this problem is to find a way to cross the river without getting wet. To do so, you will take advantage of several tree stumps in the middle of the river. A tree stump provides a safe place for you to stand as you ponder your next move. To get from one stump to another, you walk along logs that connect the stumps. In cases where no log connects to the stump you wish to reach, all is not lost. You may pick up any log adjacent to the stump on which you are standing and put it down somewhere else so that it leads to the stump you wish to reach. In order for a log to be considered adjacent to a stump, it must be oriented in the appropriate direction; for example the log in S-S is adjacent to the two stumps, but the log in S|S is not considered adjacent to the two stumps. Each tree stump is located at a point on a square grid. Two stumps are designated as the beginning and end point of the crossing. Any two stumps lying in the same row or column of the grid may be connected by a log. At any point in time, you may perform one of the following legal moves: •	Traverse a log adjacent to the tree stump you are standing on to the tree stump at the opposite end of the log. •	Pick up a log adjacent to the tree stump you are standing on. You may not hold more than one log at a time. •	Put down the log that you are holding so that it connects the stump you are standing on to some other stump. The log must be of precisely the right length to reach the other stump. The log must rest in the water: you may not use a log to connect two stumps if there is a third stump directly between them, or if the log would cross some other log already in the water.  Input specification The first line of input contains one integer specifying the number of test cases to follow. Each test case begins with a line containing two integers 1 <= r <= 15 and 1 <= c <= 15 specifying the number of rows and columns in the grid. Each of the next r lines of input contains c characters with the following meaning. The character S denotes a stump. The characters B and E denote the beginning and end stumps of the crossing, respectively. A consecutive sequence of - or | characters in a line denotes a single log whose length is proportional to the number of symbols. The character . denotes an empty grid point containing only water. There will never be more than fifteen stumps in the river.  Output specification For each test case, output a line containing a single integer, the minimum number of moves in which the end stump can be reached from the initial configuration. If it is not possible to reach the end stump from the initial configuration, output a line containing the integer 0.  Example  Input: 1 7 11 . . . . S . . . . . . . . . . | . . . . . .

 Fire!  Joe works in a maze. Unfortunately, portions of the maze have caught on fire, and the owner of the maze neglected to create a fire escape plan. Help Joe escape the maze. Given Joe's location in the maze and which squares of the maze are on fire, you must determine whether Joe can exit the maze before the fire reaches him, and how fast he can do it. Joe and the fire each move one square per minute, vertically or horizontally (not diagonally). The fire spreads all four directions from each square that is on fire. Joe may exit the maze from any square that borders the edge of the maze. Neither Joe nor the fire may enter a square that is occupied by a wall.  Input specification The first line of input contains the two integers R and C, separated by spaces, with 1 <= R , C <= 1000. The following R lines of input each contain one row of the maze. Each of these lines contains exactly C characters, and each of these characters is one of: •	#, a wall •	., a passable square •	J, Joe's initial position in the maze, which is a   passable square •	F, a square that is on fire There will be exactly one J in the input.  Output specification  Output a single line containing IMPOSSIBLE if Joe cannot exit the maze before the fire reaches him, or an integer giving the earliest time Joe can safely exit the maze, in minutes.

 Abhijeet was new to programming. He was taking C++ classes in his school. One day his teacher introduced him to arrays. One day just to test Abhijeet's understanding of arrays and mathematics his teacher gave him an assignment. Where he was given 3 arrays A, B and C ( 0-based indexing ), not necessarily of same sizes. Now Abhijeet was asked to choose 4 indices from array A such that following conditions are satisfied.  Suppose the four indices are l1,l2,l3 and l4. l1 ≤ l2 and l3 ≤  l4. l1 ≤ l3. l2 - l1 + 1 is equal to the length of array C. l4 - l3 + 1 is equal to the length of array B. For l1 ≤ i ≤ l2, A[i] = C[i-l1]. For l3 ≤ i ≤ l4, A[i] = B[i-l3].  Now teacher was interested in knowing that how many different correct answers Abhijeet can come up with. But as this number can be very large he asked you to write a program for him.  Input Description  The first line contains three positive integers, N, K and L, size of the array A, B and C respectively. Next line contains N values, elements of array A. Next line contains K values, elements of array B. Next line contains L values, elements of array C. All the arrays are 0-indexed.   Output Description Output in a single line the number of different correct answers Abhijeet can give.  Constraints 1 ≤ N,K,L ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ Ai, Bi, Ci ≤ 10^9  Example   Input 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1  Output 6  Explanation: In the given case different correct answers are: (0,0,0,0),(0,0,1,1),(0,0,2,2),(1,1,2,2),(1,1,1,1),(2,2,2,2). 
 ACM International Collegiate     Programming Contest, Asia-Amritapuri Site, 2012 The Black Riders  'Hush!' said Frodo. 'I think I hear hoofs again.'     They stopped suddenly and stood as silent as tree-shadows, listening. There was a sound of hoofs in the lane, some way behind, but coming slow and clear down the wind. Quickly and quietly they slipped off the path, and ran into the deeper shade under the oak-trees.     The hoofs drew nearer. They had no time to find any hiding-place better than the general darkness under the trees.  - Frodo, Sam and Pippin, when they encounter a Black Rider.  Indeed, the Black Riders are in the Shire, and they are looking for the One Ring. There are N hobbits out in their fields, but when they hear the Riders approaching, or feel the fear cast by their presence, they immediately wish to run and hide in M holes located nearby.  Now, each hole has space for just 1 hobbit; however, once a hobbit reaches a hole, he is able to make room for one more hobbit by digging away at the earth. The time required to make enough space for a second hobbit is C units. Also, each hole CANNOT hold more than 2 hobbits, even after digging. Also note that a hobbit can begin making space for the next hobbit only after he reaches the hole.  You are given the time required to travel from each hobbit's current location to each hole. Find the minimum amount of time it will take before at least K of the hobbits are hiding safely.  Input (STDIN):  The first line contains T, the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains 4 integers - N (no of hobbits), M (no of holes), K (minimum number of hobbits to hide) and C (time taken to expand a hole). The next N lines contain M integers each, denoting the time taken for each hobbit to each hole.  Output (STDOUT):  Output one line per test case which contains the minimum time.  Constraints:  1 <= T <= 6 1 <= N, M <= 100 1 <= K <= min(N, 2 * M) 0 < C < 10,000,000 0 < Time taken by the hobbits to the holes < 10,000,000  Sample Input:   2 3 3 2 10 9 11 13 2 10 14 12 15 12 4 3 3 8 1 10 100 1 10 100 100 100 6 12 10 10  Sample Output:   10 9  Notes/Explanation of Sample Input:   For the first test case, there are 3 hobbits and 3 holes, and we need to get atleast 2 of them to safety. We can send the first hobbit to the first hole, and the second hobbit to the second hole, thereby taking 10 time units. For the second test case, we can make hobbit #1 reach hole 1 at time 1, hobbit #2 reach hole 1 at time 9 (by when hobbit #1 would have finished digging the hole), and hobbit #3 reach hole 3 at time 6.

An ideal string of length N is a string where the 1-based index of the first occurrence of each letter, is equal to the number of occurrences of that letter in the string. For example, the string "BAOOOA"(inverted commas for clarity purpose only) is an ideal string. The letter 'B' appears 1 time, and its index is 1. The letter 'A' occurs 2 times and its first index is 2. The letter 'O' occurs 3 times and its first index is 3. String A is lexicographically smaller than string B of the same length if it contains a smaller letter at the first position they differ. Letter X is smaller than letter Y if it comes earlier in the alphabet.  Input The first line of input will consist of the number of test cases 't' (1<= t <=20) followed by t test cases. Each test case will contain an integer N(1<=N<=100) corresponding to the length of the smallest ideal string .  Output Output contains the lexicographically smallest ideal string of the length N containing only uppercase letters ('A'-'Z'). If there are no such ideal strings of length N, return an empty String instead.  Examples   Input 5 1 3 2 6 7  OutPut: A ABB  ABCBCC ABBCCCC   For the third test case there's no way we can construct an ideal string of length 2 - if both its characters are equal, then the number of occurrences (2) and the position of its first occurrence (1) do not match; if they are distinct, then for the second character the number of occurrences (1) and the position of its first occurrence (2) do not match as well.  For the fourth test case we can permute the last 3 characters in any way, but this way gets us the lexicographically smallest answer. 
 Chef likes to travel a lot. Every day Chef tries to visit as much cities as possible. Recently he had a quite a few trips of great Chefland for learning various recipes. Chefland had N cities numbered from 1 to N. People in Chefland are very friendly, friendliness of i-th city is given by Fi.  Before starting of each trip, Chef's initial enjoyment is 1 unit. Whenever he visits a city with friendliness Fi, his enjoyment gets multiplied by Fi units.   City 1 is the home city of Chef. He starts each trip from his home city. Before starting a trip, he chooses a parameter R which denotes that he will start from city 1, and go to city 1 + R, then to 1 + 2 * R, then to 1 + 3 * R, till 1 + i * R such that i is largest integer satisfying 1 + i * R ≤ N.   Now, Chef wants you to help him recreate his visit of the cities. Specifically, he will ask you Q queries, each of which can be of following two types.  1 p f : friendliness of p-th city changes to f, i.e. Fp = f 2 R   : Find out the total enjoyment Chef will have during this trip. As Chef does not like big numbers, he just asks you to output two things, first digit of the enjoyment and value of enjoyment modulo 10^9 + 7.   Input There is a single test case. First line of input contains a single integer N, denoting number of cities in Chefland. Second line of the input contains N space separated integer - F1, F2, ..., FN, denoting the friendliness of the cities in order from 1 to N. Next line contains an integer Q, denoting number of queries. For each of the next Q queries, each line corresponds to one of the two types of the query. First there will be an integer denoting the type of the query, followed by the actual query. For query of type 1, there will be three space separated integers "1 p f" as defined above. For query of type 2, there will be two space separated integers "2 R ", as defined above.  Output For each query of type 2, output two space separated integers, first digit of Chef's enjoyment in this trip followed by the value of enjoyment modulo 10^9 + 7.  Constraints   1 ≤ N, Q ≤ 10^5  1 ≤ Fi ≤ 10^9  1 ≤ f ≤ 10^9  1 ≤ p ≤ N  1 ≤ R ≤ N   Example Input: 5 1 2 3 4 5 3 2 1 1 3 10 2 2  Output: 1 120 5 50  Explanation In the first query, Chef is going to visit cities 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 in order. At the end of the trip, his total enjoyment will be 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120. First digit of enjoyment is 1 and 120 modulo 10^9 + 7 is 120. In the third query, Chef is going to visit cities 1, 3, 5 in order. At the end of the trip, his total enjoyment will be 1 * 10 * 5 = 50.

 ACM International Collegiate     Programming Contest, Asia-Amritapuri Site, 2012 The Loyalty of the Orcs  'I think that the enemy brought his own enemy with him,' answered Aragorn. 'These are Northern Orcs from far away.     Among the slain are none of the great Orcs with the strange badges.     There was a quarrel, I guess: it is no uncommon thing with these foul folk. Maybe there was some dispute about the road.' - Aragorn describing the nature of Orcs.  Indeed, everyone knows that the Orcs are treacherous creatures who look for their own satisfaction and more often than not disregard the rules. The only way to keep them in line, is by maintaining the chain of command over a strict hierarchy among the ranks, wherein each Orc is responsible to his immediate superior all the way up to the army's head.  Further, the powers that be, have decided to have regular checks of their army's loyalties, just in case some Orc has been killed and all his juniors end up turning rogue!  There are N orcs, numbered 1 to N, wherein the lead orc is numbered 1. Step 1. Randomly choose a fixed order in which to test Orcs' loyalties. Step 2. Going in this order, you make a "roll-call" to check if the current Orc is alive or not. Step 3. If the current Orc is dead, then he is marked as "deleted".  With this information, it is possible to tell which all Orcs will be loyal, and which won't be. However, cunning Master Wormtongue suggests the following optimization: In step 2, if any of the considered Orc's superiors (not necessarily immediate superior) is marked as deleted, then the roll-call is not made.  Now, given this algorithm and the hierarchy of the army, along with which Orcs are dead, what is the expected number of roll-calls (taken over all possible orderings in Step 1) that you save by performing this optimization?  Input (STDIN):  The first line contains T, the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains N, the number of orcs in the army. The next N-1 lines contain two space-separated integers u v, denoting that u is the immediate superior of v or vice-versa. The head of the army is the orc labelled 1. The next line contains m, the number of dead orcs. The next line contains m space separated integers, which are the labels of the dead orcs.  Output (STDOUT):  Output one real number for each test case containing the expected number of roll-calls that you save. The results should be accurate within an error range of 10^-6.  Constraints:  1 <= T <= 5 1 <= N <= 100,000 1 <= u, v <= N u != v The given set of u-v pairs form a valid chain of command. That means every Orc, except the Orc labeeled 1, has exactly one immediate superior.  Sample Input:   2 2 1 2 1 1 2 1 2 1 2  Sample Output:   0.5 0  Notes/Explanation of Sample Input:  For the first test case, the Orc labelled 1 is dead. The two possible orderings are [1, 2] and [2, 1]. With the optimization, for the order [1, 2], we save the roll-call to 2. So, the total number of roll-calls without the optimization is 4, and with the optimization is 3. Expected number of roll-calls is therefore, (4 - 3) / 2 = 0.5 . For the second test case, the Orc labeled 2 is dead. Since he does not have any sub-ordinates, the optimization does not have any effect.

Tired of solving all the problems given by his older brother Biswa, Debu has decided to challenge him with the following mathematical problem : A positive integer N can be written as product of powers of distinct prime numbers:  N = p1^r1 * p2^r2 .... * pk^rk  where p1, p1, ..., pk  are distinct prime factors of N  A function f is defined as: f(N, K) = Σ ri^K where ri is as described above.  Debu has asked Biswa to find the maximum value of f(N, K) for all integers 1 ≤ N ≤ C for a given value of K.  Biswa can easily solve this problem but he is too busy. So, your task is to solve this problem for Biswa.   As the answer can be very large, you just need to output answer modulo 10^9+7   Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each of the next T lines contain two space separated integers C and K.  Output For each test case, output a single line containing the answer for that case.

There may exist other values of N which give maximum value. 
  This is the year 4242 and competitive programming has become a skill essential for survival. Our protoganist HarryPotter needs to access a MuggleBook today. MuggleBooks are made by DoubleUnicornTechnolgies and are very peculiar computers. They are identical to 21st century computers even in 43^th century. No wonder they are called MuggleBooks. To access this particular MuggleBook, HarryPotter needs to solve the following competitive programming problem (remember how it's an essential skill in 4242).  " Asya has a fully connected undirected graph G with N nodes. The nodes are numbered from 1 to N. Each edge has an positive integer weight. Every time she picks a subset S of V(G) (the nodes of G), and the edges that connect them, she finds the sum of edges of the subgraph of G thus formed. She calls it the funk value, F(S) of the subset S of nodes picked.  Calculate the sum  where the summation is over all subsets S of V(G).  Here  is the floor operation and  is the set cardinality operation. "  Help HarryPotter access the MuggleBook by solving the problem.   Input  The first line contains a single positive integer N, the number of nodes in graph G. Then follow N lines, with N positive integers each. The j^th integer of i^th line is Wi,j, the weight of edge between i^th and j^th node.   Output Print one integer, the answer to the problem.  Constraints  1 <= N <= 23 1 <= Wi,j <= 10^6 Wi,j = Wj,i Wi,i = 0   Example Input: 2 0 1 1 0  Output: 1  
 Problem Duda is very funny guy in UVCE and recently he found a new kind of numbers. He calls those numbers as funny numbers. Duda says that funny number is numbers which has prime number of prime factors. For Example : prime factors of number 6 are 3 and 2, so 6 has 2 prime factors and 2 is a prime number, so 6 is a funny number. similarly prime factors of number 8 is 2, so 8 has only one prime number, hence 8 is not funny number. Now Duda wants to have some fun with his juniors and gives them a number N and asks them to identify whether the number is funny or not. Write program to determine whether the given number is funny or not and have fun with Duda.  Input First line of input contains T, number of testcases. Each testcase contains single line containing integer N, number of given by Duda.  Output For each testcase print "Funny"(without quotes) if the number given in that testcase is Funny, else print "Not Funny" in each line.  Constraints  1 <= T <= 1000 1 <= N <= 1000000  Sample Input  5 6 8 7 30 210  Sample Output  Funny Not Funny Not Funny Funny Not Funny 
Brady has recently learned addition. However, he only knows numbers with at most 6 digits! Specifically, he only knows the integers 0 to 999999.  This presents an issue when he adds two numbers: sometimes the sum has more than 6 digits. In these cases, he has a simple "solution": whenever he adds two integers whose sum exceeds 999999, he simply uniformly chooses a random integer from 0 to 999999 as the "sum" of those integers. Now, there is a sequence of integers V1, ..., VN, and Brady wants to add them one by one, starting from 0. In other words, he starts with S0 = 0, and sets Si = Si-1 + Vi (using his "addition" method) for 1 ≤ i ≤ N. For every i, what is the expected value of Si?  Input The first line of the input contains an integer N denoting the number of integers to add. The next N lines contain the integers, where the i^th line contains Vi.  Output Output N lines, where the i^th line contains the expected value of Si. Be careful about precision! Your answer will be considered correct if it is within an absolute or relative error of 10^-6 from the true answer.  Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ Vi < 10^6   Example Input: 7 99999 99999 800001 1 100 1000 5   Output: 99999 199998 999999 499999.5 500049.495 500548.94495 500551.44218723624875   Explanation #1-#3. The first three additions don't exceed 999999, so they will be performed correctly. #4. At this point, the cumulative total is 999999, and the number to be added is 1. Since this exceeds 999999, Brady just chooses a random number from 0 to 999999. The expected value is the average of all such numbers, or 499999.5 #5. At this point, the cumulative total can now have any value from 0 to 999999 with equal probability, and the number to be added is 100. If the total is less than 999900, then the addition will be performed correctly. Otherwise, the answer exceeds 999999 and a random number from 0 to 999999 is selected. The expected value among all possibilities is 500049.495. 
 Problem description. In a world full of numbers, you are given ‘N’ blocks of value 2. Your target is to merge these blocks in such a way that one bigger number is formed. The merging takes place as follows : Two blocks of value 2 will make one block of value 4, then two block of value 4 will make one block of value 8 and so on. At any step, after merging, if there is a block left, then that block is automatically upgraded to next higher value. You need to find out the numbers of block merges required to get largest number possible.  Input Description  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. Each test case contains a number ‘N’ i.e. number of blocks of value 2   Output Description The number of block merges required to get the largest number possible   Sample Input  1 5  Sample Output  4   Sample Input Explanation  5 blocks of 2s will make 2 blocks of 4 and one block of 2 will be upgraded to 4. Now 2 blocks of 4 will make one block 8 and one block of 4 will be upgraded to 8. Finally 2 blocks of 8 will make one block of 16 (which is the largest number possible). Hence number of merges required are: 2 + 1 + 1 = 4   Constraints  1 <= T <= 100000 1 ≤  Ni ≤ 10000000000

  All of us must have played the game of jumping monkeys in our childhood. It was a simple game where one had to put a monkey on a tree using a catapult. The catapult threw the monkey into a specific height in the air such that it may landed on an artificial tree. This summer one of your cousin visited you during your vacation, with a newer version of the game. This time instead of a single tree the monkey had to be taken up gradually along different levels. The height of these levels could be adjusted manually. The one to take the monkey up first would win the game. One day while playing your mischievous cousin set the height of one of the platform higher than the height to which the catapult could actually throw the monkey. You were unaware of this fact and started playing the game but could never complete it as you got stuck on that level. The next day your cousin left for his place. You were still embarrassed by you stupid defeat and thus you decided to make a program that would tell you in advance if there was even the possibility of you completing the game or not.     Input  The first line of input would contain the number of test cases.T The next line would contain the height to which the catapult could throw the monkey(H) and the number of platform present in that case(N). This would then be followed by the height of various platforms, all separated by single space. The height of all the platforms would be randomly arranged.  Assume that you are always at height zero (0) in the beginning.     Output For each of the test case you have to tell if it would be possible for you to complete the game or not. If possible give output as ‘Yes’ and otherwise give ‘No’.    Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 1000 1 ≤ H,N ≤ 10000     Example Input: 2 3 7 10 12 15 4 7 1 3 4 9 12 15 2 14 21 18 4 25 7  Output: Yes No   
  Childhood is indeed the most amazing part of one’s life. One of the various memorable things that we did were the games that we played. Everyone has played Tic-Tac-Toe in their childhood (And most of continue to do so in all the boring lectures!). One other game that all of us must have played was the game of completing a pattern by joining the various dots without lifting the pen or overwriting a previously drawn line between two dots. This was indeed difficult than Tic-Tac-Toe but guess what, we engineers never liked to do the easy things. So once again, this game is here to try out your wit but as we all have evolved from our childhood, this game has evolved too!! And, fortunately somewhere while we were growing up, computers came in our life and they now stand besides us (or in front of us!) to help us tackle this evolved game. You would be provided with a set of points numbered 1 to n, which make up a pattern. Also, the pair of points between whom a line exist would be given. Now you have to develop a program which tells if it would be possible to complete this pattern, without lifting the pen and drawing a line between the given pair of points only once.    Input  The first line of the input contains an integer N denoting the number of test cases. The next line would contain the number of points in the pattern followed by the no of pairs between which lines exist(H). The next H lines will contain the pairs of point between which the lines exist in separate lines.The pair of points would be separated by single white space.      Output The output of the program must show if it is possible to make the pattern in the given constraints or not for each test case (N). If possible the program must show ‘Possible’ or in other case show ‘Not Possible’.    Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 100     Example Input: 3 7 8 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 2 2 5 5 6 6 2 2 7 5 8 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 1 1 4 2 5 2 4 4 6 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 1 1 3 2 4  Output: Possible Possible Not Possible   
  Our country has one of the largest networks of roads in the world. Buses offer an amazing way of commuting between different cities. We students love to travel by bus as they are convenient (and cheap too!!). The government has provided us with a great bus service. There are a number of buses running each day across different cities. An engineering student now wants to attend the International Conference on Advancement in Computing and Communication Engineering (ICACCE), which is being held in another city. When he reaches the bus station he finds a map containing the buses available between different cities. From the map he comes to know that some cities have a direct bus service between them while some of them don't (And there might be no direct bus servce available to his destination city). Now he has to travel to his destination city by changing buses between various cities. But there are some cities that do not have bus service towards his destination city. Then the poor student has no option but to hire a taxi towards his destination.   For example buses are available between cities A-B, B-C, D-E, E-F where F is the final city. Now to go  from A to F he can use buses A->B, B->C, then hiring a taxi between C->D, then again using buses D->E, E->F. Now he can attend ICACCE.    The program must check whether the student can travel only through bus(es) or through bus(es) and taxi(s) between the provided cities.  # Note that buses can go in either direction between cities so he can also travel from F to A.     Input  The first line of input consists of the number of test cases(T). The first line of each test case will contain the total number of cities(C). The second line consists of number of bus services(B) available between different cities followed by the number of queries(Q) in the same line separated by a single whitespace. The next B lines will contain names of two different cities between which there is an available bus service both separated by a whitespace. After that, Q lines will contain the name of two cities between which the student has to travel also separated by a single whitespace.   # Note that city names will be integers ranging from 1 to C    Output The output of each test case must contain one of the two possibilities i.e. "only bus" or "bus and taxi".     Constraints:   1 ≤ C ≤ 100 1 ≤ B,Q ≤ 100      Example Input: 2 5 3 4 1 2 2 3 4 5 1 5 4 2 5 4 3 5 7 5 3 1 2 3 4 4 6 5 7 2 4 1 6 5 6 3 1  Output: bus and taxi bus and taxi only bus bus and taxi only bus bus and taxi only bus   
 Young Matt and Jeff loved playing with numbers. One fine day, when Matt's little brother Paul, was at his math lesson with plastic number toys i.e. plastic toys in shape of digits 0 to 9, Matt and Jeff decided to play a game. Paul had left the plastic numbers arranged to form a number N. The rules of the game were as follows:  The first player has to rearrange the digits to form a larger number than the current number, after that the game will be played turn-wise. After the first turn, each player has to rearrange the digits so that it is smaller than the current number in that turn and greater than the original number N.  The player loses if he cannot arrange a number.   What number should the first player form, so that he always wins?  Input An integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 100) denoting number of test cases followed by T lines each containing an  integer N, the number Paul has formed. The number of digit in N is D(1 ≤ D ≤ 100000).  Output  For each test case, output a number which first player should form so that he wins, in a separate line.If there is no winning strategy for first player, then output -1.  Example  Input: 3 17 81 123  Output: 71 -1 132 
 In a school in 'The land of Nowhere', students love to be the goalkeeper while playing soccer. Coach Randy has designed a method to pick a goal keeper among a givenset of students. He asks them to first stand in a line and assigns them numbers. So, the first in line is given 1, the second is given 2 and so on. Now, he asks them to form a circle. Then, he starts eliminating 'alternate' students starting from 2 (remember, its a circle; so this elimination would occur over and over) . This process continues until only one student is left, who then becomes the goalkeeper. He thinks this is a fair method, but can you do the math to beat his idea ?   Input Input consists of several input lines. First line has the number of test cases that follow, represented by 't'. Each of the following 't' lines have the total number of students 'n'.  1 < t < 1000000 0 < n < 10000000    Output For each input, output where should you stand to be selected as the goalkeeper.   Example  Input: 4 1 5 8 12  Output: 1 3 1 9  
 Problem Description An online quiz is going to be held at NIT Hamirpur. Each student will be given a system which is connected to internet. Although all the systems are connected to same network, there is still varying data transfer speed among them. This can cause pages to load slower on one system than the other. The organizers do not want a participant to have an advantage over others due to this. The organizers can't increase transfer speed on a system but they can cap it. Also they want to provide maximum speed to each system. 
 Problem Description Swapanti was born on the 9th of October, '95. Coincidentally, her best friend was also born on the same day. As a result, she has started liking 9's and 5's a lot. She tries to include it in everything she does. Her email-id has those 2 numbers. Even all the digits of her mobile number are either 9 of 5. She gets her roll number changed if the digits are anything other than 9 and 5. Clearly, she is obsessed with 9's and 5's. Given any number N, she wants to find her next smallest favourite number M greater than N. She is also a bit lazy. Help her in finding M.   Input First line of the input will consist of T, the number of test cases. Each of the next T lines contains a single number N.   Output For each test case print Swapanti's next favourite number M, in a new line.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 1000 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^99   Example Input: 4 8 58 240 69  Output: 9 59 555 95

And you know, Bhai never misses a shot!. But a hurdle to Bhai is that he has to reload the gun after he has fired 6 bullets.  Bhai is killing soldiers at one soldier per second. By this time, every other soldier moves a step towards Bhai. Also, the reloading of the gun takes one second.  Now, you have to tell whether Bhai will be able to survive or not. And if Bhai fails in killing them all, tell the Number of soldiers killed by Bhai before falling.   Input The first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. T test cases follow. In each test case, the first line contains an integer N, denoting the number of soldiers. In the next line, there are N integers representing the distance of each soldier from Bhai.   Output For each test case Print the result as: If Bhai survives: Bhai Ho! if Bhai fails: Killed M Here M is the number of soldiers Bhai killed before dying.   Constraints   1 <= T <=100 1 <= N <=50000 1 <= D[i] <= 50000  Example Input: 2 5 3 4 3 7 9 5 3 3 3 3 3  Output: Bhai Ho! Killed 3    
 Problem description N number of Postage Stamps are available in a newly opened Shop. Different Stamps have different ID's (1,2,3, ...) to distinguish one from other. Collecting Stamps is Ashish's hobby. One day his friend, Devesh, told him about the collection in that Shop. They both went to the Shop to purchase stamps. A philately competition was going on. Being too much excited, Ashish wanted to take part in the competition. Pardyot, another Stamp lover, is his competitor. The competition is such that: The Shopkeeper will give them range [a,b] , they have to find out the cost of the Stamps from a to b. The one who answers it earliest will win. Now, the cost depends upon the ID's of the Stamps. Cost is the Summation of ID number multiplied by the square of the occurence of that ID number in a given range. Pardyot is too good at Mathematics. Ashish wants your help to calculate it.   Input First line contains Integer N- number of Postage Stamps. Next line contains N integers denoting ID's of the Stamps. Next line contains Q - number of queries. Next Q lines contains two Integes a and b – starting and ending index.   Constraints  1<=N,Q<=200000 1<=ID<=1000000 1<=a<=b<=N    Output In Q lines, output the cost of the Stamps for a given range.   Example Input: 8 1 1 2 2 1 3 1 1 2 2 7 1 6  Output: 20 20  Explanation: For query 1: 2 7 occurrence of 1- 3 occurrence of 2- 2 occurrence of 3- 1 cost=3*3*1 + 2*2*2 + 1*1*3= 20

Santosh does yoga every morning and that is the secret behind his concentration level. But one fine day his friend Kishore gave him a problem to solve. He gave Santosh a number N. This represented a table of N rows. The first row contains number from 1 to N. Then the next line contains N-1 numbers. In the second row, the first number is the summation of the first two numbers of the previous row, the second number is the summation of the second two numbers of the previous row and so on. Row 3 is having N-2 numbers with same procedures. Same procedure follows for row 4, row 5, ... , row N. On the last row, there is only a single number. Santosh has to tell the number in the Nth row. For example: If N = 3, then the table is: 1 2 3  3 5   8 So Santosh has to answer the last remaining number 8. He is very comfortable answering the problem when N is small but faces difficulty when N becomes large. Can you help him?  Input The first line contains the number of testcases T. Each of the test cases contain a number N .  Output You have to output the case number and the required answer. As the number can be very large, output the answer modulo 1000000007.  Constraints 1<=T<=100000  1<=N<=100000  Example Input: 2 1 2  Output: Case 1: 1 Case 2: 3 
Today is the Annual Sports meet in NIT Hamirpur and all the students have come to see the much awaited 4X400m race. The athletes are lined up in a row from 1 to N, and each one having a chest number, Ai equal to their height. Coach Jamalta is very keen about knowing the order in which the athletes are standing and he has the power to remove anyone he wants from that line. Before the race starts he will give Q commands to the best sportsperson Prakash Chaudhary and Prakash has to obey him. The commands can be either of the following:  1. Replace the ith athlete in the line with a new athlete of height X. This will be represented in the input as a line containing the number 1 followed by the space-separated numbers i and X.  2. Count how many athletes in the range [P, Q] have Ai height <=X. This will be represented in the input as a line containing the number 2 followed by the space-separated numbers P, Q  and X.  Of course, no one can beat Prakash in any sports, but he is not so good in studies and would definitely need your help.  Input The first line gives the integers N and Q, and the next N lines give the initial values of Ai. Finally the next Q lines each contain a query of the form  1 i X or 2 P Q X.  Output Print the answer to each 2 query, one per line.  Constraints 1 ≤ Ai ≤ 1,000,000,000  1 ≤ X ≤ 1,000,000,000  1 ≤ N ≤ 1,00,000  1 ≤ P ≤ Q ≤ N   Example Input: 4 6 3 4 1 7 2 2 4 4 1 4 1 2 2 4 4 2 1 4 5 1 2 10 2 1 3 9   Output: 2 3 4 2  Explanation There are 4 athletes, whose initial numbers are 3, 4, 1, and 7. Jamalta sir then gave Prakash 6 commands; the first asks him to count the how many of the last three athletes have height at most 4, the second asks him to replace the fourth athlete with the one having height 1 unit, etc.

Well ism to iit conversion was not at all an easy task and many college students had given huge amount of time and energy in it. Well once Shashank Sir and Varun Sir were going to Delhi for one of their regular meetings with the politicians. Since the journey was long and varun sir being a batman fanatic, always imagined a self made story for batman. So he told shashank sir (the amazon guy) the story and asked him to how bane will solve that problem in his imaginative story. The story is as follows. The city of gotham was constructed keeping in mind that all the colonies in it are well connected. However, over the time as the city administration changed, more and more corrupt officals came into the administration and road maintenance was neglected and  done only in a way such that all the colonies remain connected and the sum of all the maintenance costs of these roads is minimum (all roads are of equal length but maintenance costs are different). Eg ==> if the city has 4 colonies which are connected by the maintained paths and 1 ,2 , 3 and 4 are these colonies ; then there are in total 6 paths that exist. (1-2 , 1-3 , 1-4 , 2-3 , 2-4 , 3-4) , where 1-2 denotes the path between 1 and 2. Now Bane is planning to attack the city. But he has very less number of soldiers. Therefore, he needs to find out the decreasing order of busy-ness of all the colonies. Busy-ness of a node is defined as the number of paths in which it is an intermediate colony ( not a start or end node).  You can assume that only maintained paths exist. Now given the initial map of the city (when the city was constructed , that is , with all the roads present). Find the output as given in the statement. Since shashank sir got busy with his Amazon telephonic interview therefore he asked you to solve the problem. INPUT N = number of colonies of gotham. R = number of roads that were initially constructed. The first line of input consists of number N and R . Next line consists of R triplets each i , j , k denoting that a road exists (or rather existed) between colonies i and j, and k being the maintenance cost of the roads. OUTPUT Output the decreasing order of the busy-ness of the colonies , one in each line. if two colonies have same busy-ness than output the smaller number colony first. CONSTRAINTS 1 <= N <= 2*10^5 1 <= R <= 10^7 1 <= i , j <= N WARNING :- LARGE TEST DATA . USE FASTER INPUT / OUTPUT METHODS . EG - scanf() , printf() FOR C , C++ EXAMPLE INPUT 4 5 1 2 10 2 3 15 1 3 5 4 2 2 4 3 40 OUTPUT 1 2 3 4 
 Problem description.  It is the occasion of Annual Sports Day of ISM Dhanbad. Everybody has come to watch this spectacular event. The Event is going to start with a Marchpast. Since, the event has already been delayed by an hour, the students participating in the Marchpast line up randomly to save time.  Now, the instructor got confused on how to arrange them properly in a short period of time. Therefore, he comes up with an idea that: He will remove the minimum number of students from the line such that he will end up with a line that has the students standing in monotonically increasing order according to their height.  To solve this tedious task he asks you to come up with an optimal solution. Since there is no time for excuses.   Input  First line contains single integer N, number of students. Next N lines, contain single integer denoting the height of the i^th student.   Ouput  Single Integer Output as explained in the Problem Statement.   Constraints   1 ≤ N ≤ 1,000,000 0 ≤ A[i] ≤ 1,000,000,000    Sample Input:  6 1 0 3 5 2 7   Sample Output:  2   Explanation:  {1, 0, 3, 5, 2, 7} if we remove {0, 2} we will get the desired output i.e. {1, 3, 5, 7} in which the students are in monotonically increasing order.  
  The ism to iit team when visited the college for inspection were sort of in a haste because they had already planned not to give it the premier status. However the leader of the movement Varun Pandey Sir were already ready that such things might be there in their minds. So, to make the inspection procedure really fast and smooth he made a list of all the laboratories of the department. He had asked some of his juniors to compile this list department wise. But the juniors were really lazy (matiyao types) and thus they inturn distributed the work. Now in the end the final list that Varun Sir has is a lot of strings which consists of department names. Each string represents one laboratory. Refer to example for the output.    Input The first line of input contains the number of strings n the next n lines each contains a string of length 100 max and consists of only lower case alphabets. 1 <= n <= 500 7 cse mnc cse ele cse zzza physics  Output  cse 3 ele 1 mnc 1 physics 1 zzza 1  Explanation The output contains strings sorted lexicographically and the number in front of them indicates the number of times they occured in the input. 
   The theme of the problem statement should not be taken seriously.   The CSE Society(CSES) and ACM Student Chapter have done a commendable job in improving the Coding Culture among the students of ISM by organizing various programming contests. However, both of these societies compete to show that one of them is better than the other. Still there is no clear winner. This time CodeISM has been asked to break the tie and tell which Society is better. Since CodeISM consists students passionate about Competitive Coding, they provide an innovative solution to break the tie. They ask both of them to answer the following queries on an array of numbers  A x y - Replaces the element at position x with the value y  B x y - Inverts alternate numbers between x and y(including both), starting from x.  Here inverts means that the number is replaced by bitwise not of itself  C x - Prints the value of stored at position x  D x y - Prints the bitwise xor of all the elements between x and y(including both)  The winner ACM wants to win this one, the ACM chair has asked you to make a program to do so. Please help him win.  Input The first line input contains the number elements in the array N. the next line contain N elements A[1]....A[N]. Each of the array element will fit in the unsigned 64 bit integer. The next line gives the number of queries Q. Then Q lines follow, having any of the four queries mentioned above.  NOTE: All the indices will 1-based  Output Output the corresponding answer for the queries of type C and D . The answer will fit in unsigned 64 - bit integer.  Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 100000 1 ≤ Q ≤ 100000 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ N for all the queries involving indices of the array     Example Input: 5 1 2 3 4 5 5 A 1 2 C 1 B 3 4 D 1 5 D 3 5   Output: 2 18446744073709551613 18446744073709551613    Explanation Example case 1. A 1 2 replaces A[1] with value 2 hence now the array is 2 2 3 4 5. C 1 gives the value at position 1 i.e. A[1] which is 2. B 3 4 replaces 3 with ~3 (See that 4 is not inverted as only alternate elements need to be inverted). D 1 5 and D 3 5 gives the  required Xor.

  Arya Stark, daughter of Ned Stark has decided to take vengeance of her father's death. She considers Cersei Lannister as her prime enemy. Because of the large army serving under Cersei Lannister, Arya cannot challenge her directly in a war. So she has finally decided to challenge Cersei in a game of mathematics. Since Arya never got a chance during her stay in Winterfell to study Mathematics, she has also decided to rely on you to help her put in this part.   In a game a random number N is chosen. Arya and Cersei will play the game alternatively and each of them would subtract a number(n) [n is less than N] such that N modulo n gives zero. The game is repeated turn by turn until the one , who now cannot make a further move looses the game.   Your role is to tell Arya if she can win this case or not. If Arya wins that game then print "Valar Morghulis" otherwise print "Lannisters always pays their debts". The game begins with Arya playing first move. It is well understood that both of them will make moves in optimal way.     Input Input contains test cases t (< 10^5) and followed by t numbers (1 <= N <= 10^6 ).  Output If Arya wins that game then print "Valar Morghulis" otherwise print "Lannisters always pays their debts".  Example Input: 2 212 424  Output: Valar Morghulis Valar Morghulis   
 The survivors of the ranging beyond the Wall have decided to patrol castle Black every night. With death marching on the Wall as winter draws near each patrol group has agreed it will patrol particular passages of the castle. They will patrol all passages that will enable them to begin at a particular point of the castle and return to it after their patrol. Each patrol group will patrol each passage only once. The men of castle black will patrol all such possible patrol paths. The castle can be thought to be of made junctions and passages. Junctions are places where 2 or more passages meet. However there is one problem. The men want their patrol passages to be lit with weirwood - a very special kind of wood that keeps away the dead. The amount of weirwood required to light each passage depends on the passage. They have decided to light at least one passage of their patrol with weirwood, for the night is dark and full of terrors. You are Samwell Tarly, a steward of the Night's Watch and since weirwood is a rare thing Maester Aemon has asked you to calculate the least amount of weirwood required per night given the Castle Black's description.   Input  First line of the input contains T - the number of test cases. There is a blank line at the beginning of each test case. First line of each test case consists of 2 numbers N M  N - number of junctions. Each junction for simplicity is given a number between 1 and N inclusive. M - number of passages.  M lines follow each describing a passage. Each line consists of 3 numbers X Y Z X and Y are the junctions the passage connects and Z is the number of logs of weirwood required to light the passage for one night.  Output  The minimum logs of weirwood required per night to make sure the patrols feel safe. Answer to each test case must be on a line of its own.   Constraints 1 <= T <= 10 3 <= N <= 1000 3 <= M <= 400000 1 <= X, Y <= N 1 <= Z <= 10000  Warning Large I/O. Use fast I/O routines.

Problem Description: A pyramid has been constructed using bricks. All these bricks are made of gold. However the quality of gold varies from brick to brick. The value of the bricks has been marked equivalent to nCr. Where n is the nth row of the pyramid from the top, and r is the number of the brick in that row (Both n and r start from 0). One day an invader comes and takes away all the outermost bricks of the pyramid. This disrupts the outermost shield and now some weird things happen. 1. All the rows in which the outermost golden bricks(after the invasion) have value which is not a prime number, magically disappear. 2. The value of the outermost brick can neither be a prime number nor a composite number. So now, the value of the bricks in each row gets magically divided by the value of the outermost brick. Find out the total amount magically lost.  Input:  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of Bricks.    Output:  For each test case, print the net amount that gets magically lost.

Gray codes were invented to prevent spurious output from electromagnetic switches. Consider the number 3 in ordinary binary encoding: when incremented from 011 to 100 it is unlikely that all of the switches will change states at the same time, so there is a possibility of reading the state of the variable while it is in between a transition (i.e., when some of the bits have flipped to the correct value but others haven't). To solve this problem, Frank Gray introduced a new number system in which successive numbers differ by only a single bit. You are working on a legacy system that uses Gray codes, but are having difficulty fixing a bug related to multiplication of numbers. For the purpose of debugging, you wish to convert a number's Gray encoding into the corresponding decimal representation.  Input Format The first line of input contains a single integer t, the number of test cases. This is followed by t lines, each containing a single integer, which is the result of converting the gray encoding directly to decimal. (For example, the gray encoding 100 which corresponds to 7 will be displayed as 4.)  Output Format For each test case, output a single integer that is the decimal equivalent of the gray encoding.  Example Input: 8 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7   Output: 0 1 3 2 7 6 4 5

 The Government of Greedistan has just found out that there is a lot of gold beneath some land area in their country. They quickly surveyed the land area and found that some people are living there, and surprisingly the houses are organized in a M x N grid, each cell having exactly one house. To acquire all the gold beneath this area, the government has planned to make up a rumor ( a volcano is about to erupt near by ) and let the people vacate their houses themselves. They start the rumor at only one house on day 1. It takes exactly one day for the rumor to spread from a house to any of its neighbors ( top, left, bottom, right ). They all vacate their houses as soon as they know about the volcano.  The government wants to choose the starting house for the rumor in such a way that it takes minimum number of days for all the people to vacate their houses. Find this minimum time.  Input The first line contains T, the number of test cases. Each of the next T lines contain two integers M and N. If one of M or N is zero, other one will also be zero, and this means, there are no houses at all.  T ≤ 1,000 0 ≤ M ≤ 1,000,000 0 ≤ N ≤ 1,000,000   Output  The minimum number of days it takes to spread the rumor to all houses.   Example  Input: 2 1 5 3 4  Output: 3 4  Explanation: Case 1 : Starting cell (1,3) Case 2 : See the following table with a possible answer, each cell has the first day in which they hear the rumor.   3234  2123  3234  
Raina was practicing Matrices and Determinants before his exam. He came across a question which required him to find out the number of adjacent squares for each of the squares in a grid and then sum them up. Raina tried to solve the problem but couldn’t come up with a solution. He asked his friend Sir Jadeja, who is a mathematics wizard to help him out. But even Sir Jadeja couldn’t arrive at a solution. Now Raina has turned to you for a solution. Can you help him out?  Input The first line contains a single integer T , the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The only line of each test case contains 2 integers N and M where N and M denote the number of rows and columns respectively in the grid.  Output For each test case, output a single line containing the sum of the number of adjacent squares for each square.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100000 1 ≤ N,M ≤ 10000   Example Input: 2 2 2 3 2   Output: 12 22  
Presti Digitator, the world-famous magician, is highly dissatisfied with his way of shuffling cards. Just yesterday, a perky guy in the audience demanded that he shuffle the cards once again, and he was aghast to see that the bottom card had not changed. Even though Mr. Digitator pacified the crowd with a few excellent tricks, the whole experience left him sad. He thinks that his shuffling leaves too many cards unchanged. He has decided to return to the drawing board, and retrain himself. He thinks that a "good" shuffle should leave no card in its old position. Assume that cards are numbered sequentially starting from 1. For example, if there are 4 cards initially arranged in the order 1,2,3,4, a shuffle of 2,3,4,1 would be considered good, while 3,2,1,4 would be bad since 2 and 4 are unchanged in the shuffled order. Digitator wonders whether good shuffles are rare - he would like to know, how many good shuffles of a given deck of cards there are.  Input For this question, you are given a series of numbers on distinct lines. The first line contains a number (let’s call it n) denotes how many decks there are to shuffle. This is followed by n lines, each containing a positive number less than or equal to 20. Each such number denotes the number of cards in that deck.  Output The output should have several lines. The i-th line is the number of good shuffles for the number of cards described in the i-th line. The output will fit inside a 64-bit integer.  Example  Input: 2 2 4  Output: 1 9  
 Tarun and Varun are learning game theory. Today they came up with a new game.  The rules are as follows:  Initially they have a string consisting of lowercase english alphabets only. Each of them take turn. In each turn, a player removes some alphabets from the string (at least one). But the condition is all the alphabets removed must be same (see explanation of the test cases). The player who is unable to make a move loses.   You are given the string and the player who makes the first move. You have to print the name of the winner.  Input  The first line of the input will contain a single integer T, the number of test cases. Each of next T lines will contain two strings separated by a space. First is the name of the player who starts the game (“Tarun” or “Varun” without quotes ), second is the input string with which the game is to be played.   Output  Print “Tarun”, if Tarun wins, else print “Varun” without the quotes.   Constraints 1 <= T <= 100  Input string will contain lower case alphabets only. Length of input string will not exceed 100.  Sample Cases Input 3 Tarun aaa Varun ababa Tarun abacd Output Tarun Varun Tarun  Explanation  Tarun can remove all three 'a' and win. Varun can remove a single 'a' in his turn. Tarun will be left with two 'b' and two 'a'. If he removes both 'b' Varun can remove both 'a' and win, else if he removes a single 'a', Varun will be left with 'a', 'b' and 'b'. Varun can remove a single 'b', then Tarun will be left with 'a' and 'b'. Whatever he removes, Varun will remove the last letter and win.  Note: Remember neither of them can remove letters like {'a','a','b'}, {'a','b','a','b'} etc as the condition says all the letters removed must be same. 
Once upon a time there was a King who was really paranoid about the safety of his grand palace. The map of the palace can be described by a matrix with N rows and M columns. Each cell of the matrix encodes either a wall, or free space, where trophies, jewellery and precious fur can be stored. During the last replanning of the palace, it was divided into a number of rooms, each of which has a rectangular shape on the palace map and is separated from other rooms via walls. There is also a big outer wall surrounding the whole palace which is not indicated on the map. The King is, however, still not satisfied with the safety of his palace. In order to make it even more safe, he plans to place guards at some of the free spaces in the palace. The palace guards' armour affords them a very peculiar field of vision. A guard can see only what happens at the cells that are reachable from his position via either one move of a chess knight, or one move of a chess queen. Moreover, a guard can't see what happens in other rooms. Even if a particular cell is reachable from a guard's position, but is placed in another room, the guard can't see it. The guards are instructed to attack anyone they see immediately; so if two guards see each other, they will collapse. That's why it is forbidden to place two guards in such a way that one can see the other. The King wants to place as much guards as possible to protect his assets. Please found this maximal number and find any correct placement of guards in the palace so that no guard sees another one.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers N and M denoting the number of rows and the number of columns in the palace map. The following N lines contain M characters each, each of which will be either denoting a wall (character "#") or a free space (character ".").  Output For each test case output the maximal number of guards on the first line. On the following N lines, output the map of the palace in the same format as the input, but with the character G in the cells where the guards should be placed.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ N, M ≤ 100   Example Input: 2 4 2 .. .. .. .. 4 4 .... .... #### ....   Output: 2 G. .. .. .G 3 G... ...G #### ..G.   Note In the second example, the bottommost guard is reachable from the one that stands in the second row with one chess knight move. But since they are in different rooms, it is okay to place them this way. 
Alice and Bob, both have to drink water. But they both don't want to go, so they will play a game to decide who will fetch water for both of them. Alice will choose a number randomly between 1 and N (both inclusive) and Bob will choose a number randomly between 1 and M (both inclusive). Both will write their numbers on a slip of paper. If sum of numbers choosen by both is odd, then Alice will go, else Bob will go. What is probability that Alice will go?   Input First line contains, T, the number of testcases. Each testcase consists of N and M in one line, separated by a space.  Output For each test case, output a single line containing probability as an irreducible fraction.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ N,M ≤ 10^9   Example Input: 3 1 1 1 2 2 3 Output: 0/1 1/2 1/2  Explanation #test1: The only way is when Alice and Bob both choose 1. So, Alice won't have to go because sum is even. #test2: The different ways are (1,1) and (1,2), where first term denotes the number choosen by Alice. So of all possible cases (ie. 2) in only 1 case Alice has to go. Therefore, probability is 1/2. #test3: The different ways are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3) where first term denotes the number choosen by Alice. So of all possible cases (ie. 6) in only 3 cases Alice has to go. Therefore, probability is 1/2.

Chef Polo has recently been observing the structure of Tower of Hanoi. So he decides to build his own tower and names it as Tower of HanoiCake. He decides to build it using circular pancakes. To build his tower he has to arrange them vertically, one upon another. He knows that if he places a pancake of radius r1 above pancake of radius r2 such that r1 ≥ r2, the whole tower will shake and pancake with radius r1 will fall on the floor and hence get wasted. Since Chef Polo is wise, he selects the pancakes in such a way that no pancake falls on the floor. His assistants have baked all the pancakes for him already,labelled them with their radius and have arranged them in a row. He starts his selection of pancakes in same order as they are placed in the row.He has only one chance to select each pancake. If he selects a pancake, he places it on the top of his tower else he moves on to the next one. You are required to find the maximum height of the tower which he can build.    Input The first line contains the number of test cases T. First line of each test case contains n (number of pancakes in the row) Next line contains array R of n integers denoting the radii of pancakes. .  Output For each test case, output a single line containing the maximum height of the tower he can build.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ R[1...n] ≤ 10^9   Sample Input: 2 5 8 7 2 3 4 8 2 9 4 6 5 2 2 1  Sample Output: 3 5 
  Problem description. Some people have the habit of replying hmmmmmm in chat which is very irritating. Panda's enemy Tai sent a message which consists only of lowercase English characters. Panda makes one jump from his seat when sees a substrings of type hm, hmm, hmmm, hmmmm etc.  Print the number of jumps Panda makes.  Input Input description.  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. Each test case contains a single string which is the input message   Output Output description.  For each test case, output a single line containing the number of jumps Panda will make.     Constraints  1 <= T <= 50 1 <= Length of String <= 50     Example Input: 2 hmmhm mmhhmhm  Output: 3 2    Explanation Example case 1 : The strings are hm,hmm,and hm again Example case 2 : The strings are hm and hm 
  The Agrawals have a habit of having repeated characters consecutively in their surnames. For example, you can find various people with surnames Aggrawal, Agrrawal, Agrawaal, etc. Mr. Abhishek Agrawal is given some strings. He tries to make the strings resemble his surname and likes it when strings have characters that repeat more than once consecutively.  More formally, given a string S of length N. He can choose a set T(possibly empty) containing indices of the string S. An index i can belong to the set T if character at the i^th index is not equal to all of its adjacent characters. Help Mr. Agrawal to find the total number of such distinct sets possible.   Input  First line of the input contains T denoting number of test cases. Each test case has exactly one line consisting of the input string S.   Output For each test case, output the answer in a separate line.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 1000 1 ≤ N ≤ 50 S consists of lowercase english alphabets     Example Input:  4 xy aaa xxyx a  Output:  4 1 4 2    Explanation  We will consider a 0-based indexed string here. Example case 1: He can choose various sets of indices including {0, 1} , {0}, {1}, {} since each position i in the set does not have they same neighboring character as itself. In total, we can form 4 distinct sets. Example case 2: He can not choose any set besides the {} (empty) set. Each index i has the same neighboring character as itself. Hence, it is not possible to include any of the index in any of the set. Hence, answer is 1.  
Three friends were going on a trip to Thailand. During their journey in flight, they were reading about a special type of function called Panda function. Panda function P(X) of a number X gives the count of positive integers less than than equal to X which divide it. Now, the air hostess saw what they were doing and decided to pose a problem to them.  She gives them two square free positive integers n and k, and she asks them to  compute  Since, the three friends are always greedy for speed, they sought out your help. You are required to give the answer to the question and help them impress the air hostess.   Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two space separated  integers n and  k    Output  For each test case, output a single line containing the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.     Constraints   1 ≤ T ≤ 130 1 ≤ n,k ≤ 10^17     Example Input: 1 2 2  Output: 3    Explanation P(2) = 2 (1,2 divide 2, therefore number of numbers which divide 2 is 2). so P(2^P(2)) is P(4) which is 3. (1,2,4 divide 4) 
 Pankaj, the right arm fast bowler bowls B regular balls and at most N free-hit balls due to his inconsistent line and length. Now, If a batsman scores 0 runs of a ball, then the ball is considered to be  a 'dot ball'. The batsman can either play a single ball bowled as a dot ball, or may score 1, 2, 4 or 6 runs from it. This scoring principle is same for both the regular balls as well as for the free-hit balls. The cricket match can end due to one of the following reasons.  Either there are no regular balls remaining (irrespective of the number of free-hit balls remaining). Or the batsman scores 100 or more runs(irrespective of the number of regular balls or 'no-balls' remaining).    The batting side wins the game if the batsman scores 100 or more runs. Also, since the batsman is a power hitter, he never plays three continuous regular balls as dot balls. Three regular balls are considered continuous even if there are free-hit balls bowled in between them. The free-hit balls although offer a good opportunity to the batsman to score runs but they are actually served as penalty on the part of bowler and hence, not taken into consideration of counting them as a regular ball. For example, if the bowler delivers the following sequence of balls i.e [regular ball][regular ball][free-hit ball][regular ball]. Then, it is not possible to score zero runs of all the three regular balls, irrespective of the runs scored from the free-hit balls between them. Find the number of ways in which the batting side wins the game. Since the answer can be too large, print it modulo 10^9 + 7.  Note  Do not confuse with actual rules of cricket like extra runs for no ball. Only the rules stated in the problem statement are valid.   Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers i.e B and N denoting the number of regular balls and free-hit balls respectively.   Output  For each test case, print the number of ways in which he can win the game modulo 10^9 + 7     Constraints   1 ≤ T ≤ 30 1 ≤ B ≤ 200 0 ≤ N ≤ 100      Example Input: 1 17 0 Output: 18    Explanation For the test case, the possible ways of winning are either scoring 6 runs out of all the 17 balls, or scoring 4 runs of 1 of the balls, and 6 runs out of the rest of them. 
Panda loves strings a lot. He has a kind of strange affinity with strings. He has been trying to solve several problems of strings for quite a while, and got stuck at one of them. The problem requires Panda to input two strings A and B each of length N and he needs to make set-A for all substrings of string A, and similarly set-B for all substrings of string B His dilemma doesn’t end here. To add the twist to the problem, a value K is also provided to Panda such that he needs to find the answer to four types of queries:- Type 1: The number of substrings of length K which are both in set-A and in set-B Type 2: The number of substrings of length K which are in set-A but not in set-B Type 3: The number of substrings of length K which are in set-B but not in set-A Type 4: The number of substrings of length K which are in either set-A or set-B but not in both  Since, Panda is a weak coder and he needs to solve large number of such queries,   help him to solve this problem.  Note The set will always have distinct substrings.  Input The first and second lines of the input contain string A and string B respectively. The third line contains an integer Q denoting the number of queries. Thereafter, Q lines follow where each line is having two values as input in the form of query. Each query can be represented as X K Where X denotes the type of query and K denotes the length of the substrings.  Output For each of the Q queries, you need to output answer on a separate line.  Constraints 1 <= |A|,|B| <= 5 * 10^4 1 <= Q <= 10^5 1 <= X <= 4 1 <= K <= min(|A|,|B|)   Example Input:  abab baba 4 1  2 2  4 3  2 4  4  Output:  2 1 0 2    Explanation You are provided with strings abab and baba. All possible substrings of A in set 1 are  { a, b, ab,  ba , aba, bab , abab }. All possible substrings of B in set 2 are  { a, b , ab , ba , aba , bab , baba }. We have four queries.  First one requires to output the number of substrings of length 2 which are in both set-A and set-B.  We have {ab,ba} as required substrings . The answer is 2.  Second one requires to output the number of substrings of length 4 which are in set-A but not in set-B. We have {abab} as required substring. The answer is 1.  Third one requires to output the number of substrings of length 2 which are in set-B but not in set-A.  As, all of 2 length substrings in both the sets are same, the answer is 0.  Fourth one requires to output the number of substrings of length 4 which are in set-A or in set-B but not in both.  We have {abab, baba} as required substrings. The answer is 2.

 Chef wrote some text on a piece of paper and now he wants to know how many holes are in the text. What is a hole? If you think of the paper as the plane and a letter as a curve on the plane, then each letter divides the plane into regions. For example letters "A", "D", "O", "P", "R" divide the plane into two regions so we say these letters each have one hole. Similarly, letter "B" has two holes and letters such as "C", "E", "F", "K" have no holes. We say that the number of holes in the text is equal to the total number of holes in the letters of the text. Help Chef to determine how many holes are in the text.   Input  The first line contains a single integer T ≤ 40, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The only line of each test case contains a non-empty text composed only of uppercase letters of English alphabet. The length of the text is less then 100. There are no any spaces in the input.

  ﻿Chef wanted to spend some time alone, he decided to visit a nearby graveyard. What chef was not aware about was that it was a full moon night. The night was cloudy. At one moment, when he was at the graveyard, the clouds started clearing out and the moon had shown its face, what happened next might scare you. Zombies started come out of their graves and started approaching chef from all sides, he was surrounded. There were N zombies in the graveyard, the i^th zombie was di distance away. If any zombie is able to reach chef, the chef dies. The zombies took one second to move one unit. Chef was once a soldier, he keeps a pistol with him all the time, and suppose chef has infinite number of bullets with him. Chef can only kill one zombie at a time and it takes one second to shoot one zombie. They need to be shot on their head. Now, as soon as he kills one Zombie, rest of the Zombies move forward by one unit. Assuming, he shot them optimally, your task is to find whether chef would be able to survive. One more thing, chef's gun can fire 6 shots without a reload. It takes him one second to reload and during this time zombies move one unit forward.    Input The first line of input contains T, the number of test cases.

  You have n friends and you want to take m pictures of them. Exactly two of your friends should appear in each picture and no two pictures should contain the same pair of your friends. So if you have n = 3 friends you can take 3 different pictures, each containing a pair of your friends. Each of your friends has an attractiveness level which is specified by the integer number ai for the i-th friend. You know that the attractiveness of a picture containing the i-th and the j-th friends is equal to the exclusive-or (xor operation) of integers ai and aj. You want to take pictures in a way that the total sum of attractiveness of your pictures is maximized. You have to calculate this value. Since the result may not fit in a 32-bit integer number, print it modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7).    Input The first line of input contains two integers n and m — the number of friends and the number of pictures that you want to take. Next line contains n space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., an — the values of attractiveness of the friends.   Output The only line of output should contain an integer — the optimal total sum of attractiveness of your pictures    Constraints  1 <= n <= 5*10^4 0 <= m <= n*(n-1)/2 0 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9  Sample input 1: 3 1 1 2 3  Sample output 1: 3  Sample input 2: 3 3 1 2 3  Sample output 2: 6 
Two good friends M.H. and S.K.M. like to play with digits.... One fine morning another friend A.D. gave them a huge stream of digits and asked some rather 'simple' questions. The two good friends M.H. and S.K.M. scrathed their heads and could not come up with an efficient solution.Can you help them?  The digit stream presented was 0123456789101112131415161718.........  A.D.'s rather simple questions went like this: he gave q the number of questions he would ask and then asked those questions as what is the 100 th digit in the sequence? what is the 112322th digit in the sequence? and so on...    Formally speaking, You will be given q queries and each query will be a positive integer which denotes the position(starting with 0) who's digit you are required to find.  Input format:  Input starts with q the number of queries.Each query is presented in a new line. Output format:  The digit in the required position in the above stream in a new line. Constraints: 1<=q<=10^6 and each query will be a positive integer  Sample input:  4 0 3 10 11 Sample Output:  0 3 1 0 
  There is a fest arranged in Banasthali University by Wappers. Yasha has come to the arranged stalls to eat. There are numbers assigned to each stall. Yasha visits only the magical stalls. Description of Magical stalls: Calculate the sum of squares of each digit of stall number. Continue the process while checking if this sum is 1 at any iteration, then it is a magical stall. If the sum never turns up as 1 , it is unmagical stall.     INPUT The first line contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. In each test case, first line have an integer M, denoting number of Stalls. Second line have space separated M integers such that each integer denotes the stall number.     Output For each test case output "YES" if the number is magical and "NO" if it is not in different lines.  Constraints 1<=T<=1800  1<=M<=50     Example Input:  1 3 1 2 7   Output:  YES NO YES     Explanation Example case 1. 1 is a magical number as 12=1.  2 is not a magical number as 22 =4. 7 is a magical number as 72=49  , so 42+92 =97 , so 92+72 =130  , so 12+32+02 =10 , so 12+02 =1.  
  There is an exam going on in the campus and our invigilator Nidhi  is very strict. Still students manage to cheat. If one copies an array of integers from some other student, any circular arrangement of the array is valid is an answer. The first number in the answer defines the circular arrangement chosen. But in hurry student copy the numbers at wrong places. You have to calculate the cheat number ie number of digits that have been displaced from their correct position.    INPUT The first line contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Next line have an integer N. The valid array can take the form 1 to N or any of its circular arrangement. Further there are T lines each with an instance of copied array.    Output Print number of digits displaced from their position for each instance in different line.  Constraints 1<=T<=100  1<=N<=100     Example Input:  2 4 1 2 3 4 2 1 3 4   Output:  0 3     Explanation In first line, 2 is number of instances of copied array. From second line we get to know the valid arrays are 1 2 3 4, 2 3 4 1, 3 4 1 2, 4 1 2 3.In first test case the array matches with valid array so the cheat number =0. In second case first digit is 2 ,so we have to match our given array with the valid array 2 3 4 1.The digit 1 had to be on position fourth,3 had to be on second, 4 had to be on third. Thus cheat number =3.

 Little Johny is a polar bear which lives in arctic region.The bear can hardly tolerate any increase in atmospheric temperature. After an intra galactic explosion fragments of several meteorites are showered on the entire arctic region in the form of fire bodies. Little Johny is severely scared of this natural phenomenon as this has caused an considerable increase in temperature of arctic region. The fire bodies are now randomly distributed on the surface of the arctic region.Poor Johny is now in search of the coolest region for his own survival.Little Johny has got a unique power that once he found such a region and own it he can have access to all the ice units in that region. But the cons is that the bear cannot avoid the heat produced by the fire bodies present in that region.Johny has to find the coolest region as soon as possible. Your task is to find the area of the coolest region that Johny need for his survival.If there are more than one possible coolest regions, then print the one which has maximum area.                Consider the arctic region as a N X M map.Each cell of the map is either represented by "F" or "I" which represents fire and ice respectively. The magnitude of each "F" or "I" is computed by the following formula :              F=(m^(im+jm))%P I=(n^(in+jn))%P where m=  serial number of a particular fire starting from one and counted row wise im=  row number of mth fire starting from 0 jm=  column number of mth fire starting from 0  n=serial number of a particular ice starting from one and counted row wise in=row number of nth ice starting from 0 jn=column number of nth ice starting from 0  P Note : The region is defined as sub-matrix of the original matrix.  Input  The first line of the input contains the number of test cases T.Then follows T test cases.First line of each test case contains N and M ,the dimensions of the Arctic region.Then follow a N X M character matrix filled with character 'F' or 'I'. The last line of each test case contains an integer P which is basically a prime number.   Output  For each test case output the area of the coolest region required for Little Johny for his survival.If there are more than one possible coolest regions, then print the one which has maximum area.

 Icarus is super enthusiastic in becoming the best GO player in the world, and right now he is aiming to surpass his rival Troy. That is why he is training hard in many creative ways.  He knows that a great ability for a good GO player is to count the number of groups and the degrees of freedom of each one just with a quick sight.  As you know, a group is a set of stones in which each stone of the group is adjacent to another stone of the group; and the freedom degree a group is equal to the number of empty intersections that are at least adjacent to one stone in the group. In GO, adjacency is only vertical or horizontal, not diagonal. As the diagram shows, in this reduced 6x6 board there are one big white group consisting of four stones and freedom degree five (5), one black group of two stones and freedom degree four (4) and two black groups of one stone with two freedom degree two (2) each.  A good friend of him made a quick random board generator. It creates a GO board with a certain number of stones placed on it and then Icarus estimates the groups and their degrees of freedom. After that, the computer checks if he was right counting them manually. The only problem is that the computer validation has not been implemented yet, so your task is to help Icarus by writing a program that generates the correct answer. This way, Icarus will be able to validate his answers and finally defeat Troy.     Input The first line contains an integer T, which species the number of test cases. Then, T test case descriptions will follow.    The first line contains a pair of integers N and S, which specify the length of the board (which is always square) and the number of stones in it. Then, S lines will follow, each one containing the following items separated by a single white space:  A character 'B' or 'W' if the stone is black or white respectively. An integer Ci represents the column where the stone i is placed. An integer Ri represents the row where the stone i is placed.   Remember that the bottom-left intersection in the board is (1,1) and the top-right intersection is (N,N).     Output  For each board you must print the string "Case #i:" in a line, where i is the board number, starting from 1. Then, you must print one line for each group in the board, printing a character 'B' if the group is black or 'W' if the group is white, the number of stones in the set and the freedom degrees of that group; those three elements should be separated by single a white space. The groups should be sorted by the following rules:  Put black groups before white groups. If two groups are of the same color, put bigger groups first. If two groups are of the same color and the same size, put groups with greater freedom degree first.    Example Input 3 6 8 B 5 2 W 4 2 B 5 4 W 4 4 B 5 5 W 5 3 B 6 3 W 4 3 9 6 W 5 5 B 9 5 B 9 1 W 1 1 B 1 2 B 2 1 6 5 B 1 1 B 1 2 W 3 1 W 2 2 W 3 2  Output Case #1: B 2 4 B 1 2 B 1 2 W 4 5 Case #2: B 1 3 B 1 2 B 1 2 B 1 2 W 1 4 W 1 0 Case #3: B 2 2 W 3 5   Constraints:   T will be between 1 and 200, inclusive. N will be between 1 and 10^6, inclusive. S will be between 1 and min(N^2,250), inclusive. Ci will be between 1 and N, inclusive, for all i between 1 and S. Ri will be between 1 and N, inclusive, for all i between 1 and S. There will not be more than one stone in the same intersection.  
Alice and Bob are siblings who are very good at calculating things. Both of them have set world records and are known as 'the human calculators'. Bob is faster at calculating things but Alice is better at mathematics. One day Bob challenged Alice to calculate f(n), where f(n) = 1^n × 2^n-1 × 3^n-2 × ... × (n-1)^2 × n Alice knew that Bob's math is weak, so she said, "This is too easy for me. I will not just find f(n), I will also divide it by 10^9+7 and tell you the remainder". Bob thought Alice was being overconfident, but if you are good at math you would know that she was just being smart to avoid too much calculation! Bob asked Alice to calculate f(n) modulo 10^9+7 for several values of n. Alice did so in a few seconds. Now Bob has to check if Alice's answers are correct or not. He is too lazy to do the calculation himself. You have to help Bob by writing a program that finds f(n) modulo 10^9+7 for different values of n. Input The first line will contain a single integer T, the number of test cases. Each of the next N lines contain a single integer N, for which you have to compute f(N). Output Print f(n) modulo 10^9+7 for each N. Constraints 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000 1 ≤ N ≤ 10000000 Sum of all N in an input file does not exceed 20000000 Sample input 4 1 2 3 4  Sample output 1 2 12 288  Explanation 1^1 = 1 1^2 × 2^1 = 1 × 2 = 2 1^3 × 2^2 × 3^1 = 1 × 4 × 3 = 12 1^4 × 2^3 × 3^2 × 4^1 = 1 × 8 × 9 × 4 = 288 
Bob loves playing computer games. He is playing a computer game called Pocket Tanks. He plays it all day, taking only tea breaks in between. He take T tea breaks on a particular day (He plays for T+1 sessions). Between any 2 tea breaks he has to pass N difficulty levels. Pocket Tanks is a game where the player has to move his/her tank to a specific place. The number of moves he can make in a game always lie between [1, K]. This K and N is given to him by her friend Alice during the tea break (They always have tea together ;). Given a number X at the start of day, he has to find the number of ways to get this number (X) as a sum of moves for N games he plays in one session. He then sums up this value for all the sessions he plays. If the final value Y % 1000000007 is correct, he wins.  Input The first line will contain two integers T and X. Each of the next T+1 lines contain a two integers N and K.  Output Print one integer corresponding to the answer (Y) modulo 1000000007.  Constraints 0 <= T <= 10 1 <= (N * K) <= 10000 1 <= X <= 1000  Sample input 0 8 3 6 Sample output 21 Explanation As per the testcase, Bob has 0 tea breaks, so he plays just one session. In that session he has to play 3 levels and with a maximum of 6 moves per level. He can either make 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 moves in each level. Finally he has to make such moves that he is able to make a total of 8 moves. Since he plays for only one session, he has to make a total of 8 moves after 3 levels to win. The number of ways in which he can make such moves is 21.

  Problem description. As a BITS - Pilani student and a football player, Bayne was delighted once he heard the news, BITS-Pilani is finally participating in the National Football League (NFL). A team is to be formed of "n" players, all of which are BITS students. However, the team might have players belonging to different departments. There are "m" departments in BITS, numbered from 1 to m. Bane's department has number "h". For each department "i", Bane knows number s[i] — how many students who play football belong to this department.  Bane was also able to guarantee a spot on the team, using his special powers. But since he hates floating-point numbers, he needs your help at finding the probability that he will have at least one teammate belonging to his department.  Note that every possible team containing Bane is equally probable. Consider all the students different from each other.  Input  The first line of the input contains three integers n, m and h denoting the number of players on the team, the number of departments in BITS and Bane's department, correspondingly. The second line contains a single-space-separated list of m integers si (1 ≤ s[i] ≤ 100), denoting the number of students in the i-th department. Note that s[h] includes Bane     Output  Print the probability that Bane will have at least one teammate from his department. If there is not enough football players in BITS to participate in NFL, print "-1"(without quotes).   NOTE :  The ans should be rounded off to 6 decimal places i.e. should contain maximum 6 digits after decimal point.  For eg. In C++ you can use setprecision(6), and in c : printf("%0.6lf") .     Constraints  1 ≤ n ≤100 1 ≤ m ≤1000 1 ≤ h ≤m     Example Input: 3 2 1 2 1  Output: 1 
   Problem description. "Pandas Don't Cry" is a semi professional band. Recently, they bought a new tour bus, which they will use to travel from one city to another for their concerts. Unfortunately they don't have much funds left now. The Band's lead guitarist is worried as to how they will pay the tolls when they move from one city to the other, as they travel a lot. He doesn't have to worry about the fuel since that is taken care of by the band's sponsors. So he decides to take a route that will cost them the least on the basis of the toll that they have to pay when they move from one city to another. Now he thinks that he only has to minimise the toll. So he decides to choose a path that will cost them the least(toll-wise). But the next concert starts in T minutes!!! He soon realises that taking the path which would cost them the least toll may not be such a good idea as the band has to reach the destination city in less than or equal to T minutes, and the path through which they will have to pay the least may not take them to their destination in that time. He has no idea how to solve this problem. He asks you for help.  Given a starting city and a destination city, tell the minimum toll that the band will have to pay to go from the starting city to the destination city.   Input  The first line of the input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases. For each of the t test cases, the first line contains the number of cities N and available time T. The first city is the city at which the band starts, the last city is the their destination city. After this line there are N lines with N numbers each, specifying for each city the travel time to the i-th city. The table is terminated with an empty line. The table of the tolls follows in the same format. In other words, each entry in row i and column j denotes the time/toll incurred on moving from city i to city j.    Output  For each test case, output a single line containing the minimum toll that the band will have to pay followed by the total travelling time.     Constraints  1 ≤ t ≤ 30 3 ≤ N ≤ 50 0 ≤ T ≤ 1000     Example Input: 1  4 10 0 9 2 3 1 0 2 4 2 1 0 2 2 2 2 0  0 1 1 3 1 0 1 2 2 3 0 9 5 2 5 0   Output: 3 3   
 A rectangular garden is divided into square shaped cells where each cell consists of a plant. Some plants depending upon their nature need more water than others and some may not require water at all. Invisible water taps keep teleporting around the garden. Each water tap gives water to a plant for a constant time and then teleports to another( or reappears in the same cell ) to give water to another plant( or the same plant ). To simplify the structure, each water tap moves with respect to a base cell, Row offset set and a Column offset set and keeps repeating through the set. For example:   Consider a 6 X 6 size rectangle:   Therefore,   Total Rows = 6 Total Columns = 6 Total cells = Total plants = 36   Now consider a tap with following properties   1. Base cell:         0 2. Row Offset Set:       0 1 2 0 0 3. Column Offset Set: 1 0 0 1 2    The cell numbers for the garden in this case will be:     0       1      2       3     4      5   6       7      8       9    10   11 12   13   14   15   16   17 18   19   20   21   22   23 24   25   26   27   28   29 30   31   32   33   34   35   This means the tap starts with giving water to cell '1'( Row offset 0, column offset 1 with respect to cell '0' i.e. the base cell ) and then moves to cells 6 -> 12 -> 1 -> 2. The new cell position is with respect to the base cell, the current row and column offset and has got nothing to do with the previous cell positions where water tap was teleported. Also note that the tap would continuously move in the following order 1->6->12->1->2->1->6->12... and so on.   All the water taps are synchronised i.e. all of them change the cells at the same time, give water for the same amount of time and so on. Consequently, there may be such plants, which at some time instant get water from every tap in the garden. These plants are called Aqualoo plants.   Now given the taps and their respective base cell, row offset set and column offset set, you have to give out the total Aqualoo plants in the garden.    Notes  - Remember that for the plant to be Aqualoo, every tap in the garden should water this plant at same time instant. - Every tap may or may not have a different base cell, row offset and column offset.   Input  1. Number of test cases = 'T' ( 1 <= T <= 300 ) 2. For each test case, first line of input contains number of rows = 'R', followed by number of columns = 'C' and total number of water taps = 'N' ( 1 <= R <= 50, 1 <= C <= 50, 1 <= N <= 6 ). 3. For each tap, first line of input contains base cell number = 'B', followed by length of the row offset set and column offset set = 'L' ( 0 <= B < R * C, 1 <= L <= 25 ). 4. Next line contains row offset set, where each value lies in range ( -R, +R )( not inclusive ). 5. Next line contains column offset set, where each value lies in range ( -C, +C )( not inclusive ).   Output  1. Each line of output contains total Aqualoo plants   Example Input: 2  6 6 2 7 1 2 3 35 1 -2 -1  6 6 2 13 4 0 1 1 0 0 1 2 3 4 3 0 1 2 0 0 0  Output: 1 1

  Valentine's Day is coming and our friend Mr.IDC has fallen in love with a girl. He just could not control his feelings and went to propose her. When he proposed her the girl gave him a challenge and asked him to solve it and the condition was if he will solve the challenge successfully then only she will accept his proposal. Since the girl likes mathematics very much so she asked him to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to N as:  for ( i=1;i<=N;i++ ) 	sum += i % MOD; ( Since the girl is also in love with him so she does not want him to waste his time on large numbers, therefore she is gave him the MOD value also to reduce his calculations. ) Now she wants him to calculate the sum using the above definition. This sum will also prove how much he love her. ;)     Input First Line of input contains T, the number of testcases. The next T lines will contain two integers N and MOD.    Output For each testcase print the output in a new line.    Constraints:  1 <= T <= 1000 1 <= N <= 10^9 1 <= MOD <= 10^9     Example Input: 3 20 5 10 2 5 3  Output: 40 5 6    Explanation Testcase 1:  For N = 20 m = 5, Sum = 1%5 + 2%5 + 3%5 + 4%5 + 5%5 + 6%5 + 7%5 + 8%5 + 9%5 + 10%5 + 11%5 + 12%5 + 13%5 + 14%5 + 15%5 + 16%5 + 17%5 + 18%5 + 19%5 + 20%5 = 40 You can check yourself for testcase 2 and 3. 
  Finally Mr.IDC has a girlfriend now and he wants to send her love letters. Since he is afraid of being caught by her parents therefore he encrypts the message using Caesar Cipher. While writing the letter he has replaced each character with a new character (Ci - K) mod 26 where  ( i = [ 0,|message| ] ). After finishing writing the letter, he sends it to his girlfriend and messages her the key K to decrypt his message. She has received the letter but doesn't know how to decrypt. She wants to read what is written in the letter therefore she needs your help in decrypting the message.    Input First line of input contains T, number of testcases. Each testcase contains two lines. First line contains K and the next line contains the encrypted message {'a'-'z'}.  Output For each testcase, output the result after extracting the original message in a new line.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ K < 26 1 ≤ |encrypted message| ≤ 10^4     Example Input: 2 14 uxahqkag 7 fbgwlpxxixkl  Output: iloveyou mindsweepers   
A circular prime is a prime number with the property that the number generated at each intermediate step when cyclically permuting its (base 10) digits will be prime. Simply if all the rotational digits of a number are themselves prime It is called a prime number. For an example 1193 is a circular prime because 1931, 9311, 3119 are also prime. So according to above description first 10 circular primes will be 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 37, 79, 113. In this problem you are supposed to fine the number of circular primes below a given limit.   Important: The combination of each circular is primes are neglected when counting. That means only the lowest number is counting.   Input  The first line will contain the number of cases and the next lines will give the limit.   Sample Input 4 10 20 50 200  Output The output must contain the number of circular primes below that each given limit   Sample Output  Number of circular primes below 10 is 4 Number of circular primes below 20 is 7 Number of circular primes below 50 is 8 Number of circular primes below 200 is 12 
                     Throughout history there have been many different interesting numbers or types of numbers. One of these types is amicable numbers. Amicable numbers are a pair of numbers with the following property: the sum of all of the proper divisors of the first number (not including itself) exactly equals the second number while the sum of all of the proper divisors of the second number (not including itself) likewise equals the first number.                       The set of 220 and 284 was the first known set of amicable numbers. Pythagoras discovered the relationship and coined the term amicable because he considered the numbers to be a symbol of friendship.  For example let's show that 220 & 284 are amicable numbers:  First we find the proper divisors of 220: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, 110 If you add up all of these numbers you will see that they sum to 284. Now find the proper divisors of 284: 1, 2, 4, 71, 142 These sum to 220, and therefore 220 & 284 are amicable numbers.                               You should be able to declare a number is a amicable or not.   Number of cases will be < 10 The Input number is < 100,000   Input The first line of the input file contains the number cases followed by set of numbers one in each new line.   Output If the number is not an amicable number it should print no, if it is an amicable number it should print yes and the amicable number of it.   Example  Input: 4 1184 2620 3550 5020  Output: Yes, amicable with 1210 Yes, amicable with 2924 No Yes, amicable with 5564  
 An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of each of the individual digits that make up the number raised to the power of the number of digits the number has. you need to insert starting number and last number of the region you need to find Armstrong numbers.

Constraints  100 <= N <= 999   Example Input: 100 1000  Output: 153 370 371 407   Explanation You need to find all the armstrong numbers within given range. 
  Problem description: Write the 'lcs' function that takes two sequences and finds the length of longest common subsequence present in both.. Function prototype:  "int lcs( char *X, char *Y, int m, int n )"   A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous. For example, “abc”, “abg”, “bdf”, “aeg”, ”acefg”, .. etc are subsequences of “abcdefg”. So a string of length n has 2^n different possible subsequences.  Example: Input:  ABCDGH  AEDFHR Final Output: 3  Interpretation : 	common 'ADH' subsequence is of of length 3.  Sample main function C/C++:  int main()  {     string string_X;     string string_Y;   cin >> string_X;   cin >> string_Y;  int m = string_X.length(), n = string_Y.length();  char * X = new char[m + 1];   char * Y = new char[n + 1];   strcpy (X, string_X.c_str()); strcpy (Y, string_Y.c_str()); printf("%d\n", lcs( X, Y, m, n ) );     getchar();    return 0;  } 
This is a simple game you must have played around with during your school days, calculating FLAMES of you and your crush! Given the names of two people, cancel out the common letters (repeated occurrence of a letter is treated separately, so 2A's in one name and one A in the other would cancel one A in each name), count the total number of remaining letters (n) and repeatedly cut the letter in the word FLAMES which hits at the nth number when we count from F in cyclic manner. For example: NAME 1: SHILPA NAME 2: AAMIR After cutting the common letters: NAME 1: SHILPA NAME 2: AAMIR Total number of letters left=7 FLAMES, start counting from F : 1=F, 2=L, 3=A, 4=M, 5=E, 6=S,7=F...So cut F FLAMES: repeat this process with remaining letters of FLAMES for number 7 (start count from the letter after the last letter cut) . In the end, one letter remains. Print the result corresponding to the last letter: F=FRIENDS L=LOVE A=ADORE M=MARRIAGE E=ENEMIES S=SISTER   Input The no. of test cases ( Output FLAMES result (Friends/Love/...etc) for each test case   Example  Input: 2 SHILPA AAMIR MATT DENISE   Output: ENEMIES LOVE        By: Chintan, Asad, Ashayam, Akanksha 
 Please use N,S,E,W in place of U,D,R,L. Laziness is the biggest and the only trait that our friend Kadka has. He is so lazy that even turning around is a pain in the leg [;)] for him. A complete idiot that he is, he cannot use his own mind and just follows directions. He is stuck in a maze and needs to get out. At every step he just follows the direction to the next position and thinks of nothing else. He always enters through the first row. The maze is like a grid  U 	R 	R 	D2 	L1 	R L10  L9	 L 	R3 	D4 	D D 	U8  	L7 	L6 	L5  	L  Where the numbers indicate the positions that were explored by Kadka.

You are moving from cities to cities in search of a treasure. There are N cities numbered from 0 to N-1. Initially you are at city no. 0 and Treasure you are looking for is at city number N-1. Each city is connected to two cities directly except for city number 0 and city number N-1 wich are connected to only one city directly. 0-->1-->2-->3-->4........-->N-1 As the journey from a city to another city is tiring you can pass at maximum d-1 cities without stopping. For eg. if you are at city 0 and d is 3 then you can move from 0 to 3 without stopping at city 1 or city 2. If you stop at any city you have to pay a certain amount of money M[i] to that city which varies from city to city. Given money required to pay for stopping at each cityy our task is to reach city number N-1 from city number 0 by spending minimum amount of money possible. Remember You can only start from city 0 if you pay the amount that should be paid to city 0. As you have to reach city N-1, you have to stop there, so you will have to pay the respected amount.     Input :  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. On the first line of every test case is given two space separated integers N and d.The next n lines that follow have positive integers <= 1000, representing the money to be paid at each city. These lines are listed, in order, from start to end city.    Output :  For each test case, output a single line containing.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 50 1 ≤ N ≤ 10000 1 ≤ D ≤ 5000     Example Input: 2 2 1 1 1 12 3 1 4 2 6 5 1 1 8 7 3 1 2  Output: 2 10 
Problem Description  Given a string, find the number of palindromic substrings of the string whose length is a prime number.The string consists only of lowercase english alphabet.

The palindromic substrings in the string are "a","b", "a",and "aba". But only palindrome "aba" is of prime length . So, output is 1. Example case 2. The palindromic substrings in the string are "a", "b", "a" , "b", "a", "c", "aba", "aba", "bab", "ababa".The prime length palindromes are "aba", "aba", "bab", and "ababa"  . So, output is 4. Here, we take both “aba” and “aba” as two different palindromes. 
 Problem Description Deoria is a great city with Big malls. The city is full of intelligent people. The head of them is a boy named KOOL. He is very fond of roaming. He has a girlfriend named KOOLER. One day KOOL and KOOLER decided to visit the biggest mall of city but the mall has very weird entry criteria. A person cannot enter the mall without solving the puzzle.  The puzzle is as follows:   You are given a balanced binary tree of height H and infinite number of stones. You have to tell the minimum number of stones needed to visit the whole tree. Move the stones on the tree such that   whole tree is traversed. No nodes of the tree can be visited twice. Stone can be moved only along the edges between the nodes. Only one stone can be used for one traversing.   Help KOOL and KOOLER.   Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then, T lines follow. Each line contains an integer H( Height of the tree).  Output For each test case, output a single integer indicating the minimum number of stones needed  As answer can be very large so output number of stones % 1000000007 .  Constraints 1 ≤ T ≤ 100000 1 ≤ N ≤ 100000000 (10^9)  Example Sample Input: 1 1  Sample Output: 1 Sample Input: 1 2  Sample Output: 1 
Problem Description KOOL is back.   Now KOOL's girlfriend KOOLER left him because of some runtime issues.  To be precise the issue with KOOL is the following :   Being human he can remember only few number of  friends( Say it is N).  He forgets the friend he interacted least recent.  He makes new friend and forgets the old.  You have to mimic the KOOL's brain. You have to answer the queries. The queries are of following types :  1 I :  He interacted with friend having ID number=I. 2 I : Answer "YES" if KOOL can remember the friend with ID number = I otherwise "NO".   Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then,for every test case, first line contains two space separated integers N(Capacity of KOOL brain) and Q(number of Queries ) . Then Q lines contains the queries.  Output For each test case , output the answer of the every query of type 2.  Constraints 1 ≤ T ≤ 10 2 ≤ N ≤ 1000 (10^3) 1 ≤ Q ≤ 10000 (10^4) 1 ≤ I ≤ 10000 (10^4)  Example Sample Input: 1 2 5 1 1 1 2 1 3 2 1 2 2  Sample Output: NO YES  Explanation: Here the capacity of KOOL brain is 2. He interacts with 1->2->3 ID number friends. He forgot friend with ID number 1 and remember only 2,3. So answer is NO and then YES .

 Problem Description   This time Ignus 15 is back with amazing pronites. There are two ways for attending the pronites: 1. Buy the tickets (Or arrange for a pass). 2. Crack the entrance door lock. As Timo is on a budget (after Valentines' Day celebration), she can't go for the first option. Help her out with the second way. The problem is simple. The entrance door lock generates four random strings s1, s2, s3 and s4 of the same length n. You must find out the maximum possible length m of any string s so that: For 1 <= i <= m, there exist integers a(i), b(i), c(i) and d(i) belonging to [1, n] such that: s[i] = s1[a(i)] where a(1) < a(2) < a(3) ... < a(m) s[i] = s2[b(i)] where b(1) < b(2) < b(3) ... < b(m) s[i] = s3[c(i)] where c(1) < c(2) < c(3) ... < c(m) s[i] = s4[d(i)] where d(1) < d(2) < d(3) ... < d(m)   Input First line contains T, the number of test cases. Each test cases has 5 lines of input, the first line has the number n, length of the generated strings. The other 4 lines of a test case contain strings s1, s2, s3 and s4 respectively.    Output For each test case, print the value of m in a single line.    Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ n ≤ 30 All characters in all strings are lowercase English alphabets.     Example Input: 3 10 abcdefghij abcdefijgh ababckjdge cdeabcjdeg 2 ab ab ab bb 3 abb aba bab bab  Output: 5 1 2    Explanation  Case 1: abcde or abcdg can be the required string s here. So maximum length is 5 Case 2: The only possible string is b, therefore maximum length is 1 Case 3: ab is the only possible string. Hence, maximum length is 2  
 Problem Description   You are an army personnel in the great army of the Zorin race, where you are a part of a team of n people. Unfortunately, your army has lost a war to an intergalactic species, genetically much advanced than yours. Their captain Bruno have kept all your men (including you) as hostages, and now they are trying to have some fun. He asks each of the n people to choose any integer from 1 to n that is not taken by someone else. i.e. no two persons can have the same chosen number. Then he arranges all the n people in a circle sequentially and starts with person number 1. He leaves 1, shoots 2, leaves 3, shoots 4 .... and goes on shooting people alternately until only one person remains. He then offers the lucky man to restart his own kingdom and grants him all his looted resources. It is you who is asked first to choose your number k. What will you choose as your lucky number?   Input  First line contains T, the number of test cases. Each test case has the number n in a single line, denoting the number of people captured by Captain Bruno.     Output For each test case, print the value of k in a single line.    Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100000 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000000000000000000     Example Input: 6 6 125 32 46 98 156   Output: 5 123 1 29 69 57    Explanation  Case 1: n = 6. In the first round 2, 4, 6 are killed, 1, 3, 5 remain. In next round 3 is killed. Then 1 is killed, therefore leaving 5. So answer = 5.

 In Ancient Greece, Athenians and Spartans are two well known warring Tribes. One the occasion on Carnea, the two warring tribes come and celebrate the festival together. For the festival, the two have to stand in a line of length n (the n people will consist of both Spartans and Athenians without any restriction on number of athenians and spartans) and honor the Greek gods. But Spartans, being jealous of Athenians,  decided that they will always stand in contiguous groups of length L smaller than their sacred no. k (except 1) and also being coprime to it. Note: There can be multiple such contiguous groups in a line. However Athenians have no such demand and they can stand in whatever way they like. One day our Athenian Hero Aditya the D A /\/ G E R O U $ :P heard of this plan of Spartans and decided to count the total no of ways in which the line can be formed and announce it publicly during the festival to show them the knowledge of Athenians. But as you know he is lazy and busy playing CS your task is to help him determine the number of ways the line can be formed.  Input: The input consist of t testcases. Each testcase consist of two integers n and k separated by space.  Output: Output the total no of ways to arrange the Spartans and Athenians int the line.  Constraints: 1 <= T  <=10, 1 <=  N  <= 50, 1 <=  K  <= 10    Sample Input :  1 3 5    Sample Output :  4  The possible ways are AAA SSA ASS SSS where A denotes Athenians and S denotes Spartans. 
  Given a set of n numbers. A group is subset of these numbers such that all elements contained inside the group have gcd/hcf 1. Find the maximum possible value of size of such group.    Input First line contains a single integer t, representing the no of test cases. 	For each test case:- 		First line contains a single integer n,size of input array 		Second line contains n numbers a[1],a[2],.....,a[n]  Output For each test case output a single integer representing the required answer.    Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ N ≤ 20 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^6     Example Input: 3 3 3 4 5 4 2 4 8 16 4 2 3 4 8  Output: 3 0 4   Explaination:  Sample 1: HCF of 3,4,5 is 1. Hence group size = 3. Sample 2: No group possible whose HCF is 1.Hence 0. 
 Problem Description: You are given n integers. You have to delete minimum number of elements so that the remaining elements satisfy the property a <= 2 * b where a is the maximum value in the remaining elements and b is the minimum value in the remaining elements.   Input:  First Line: contains number of integers n. Second Line: contains n space seprated integers ai.   Output:   Print one integer, the minimum number of elements that will have to removed.   Constraints:  1 <= n <= 10^5 1 <= a[i] <= 10^5   Example Input: 6 3 7 4 5 3 8  Output: 2 Input: 4 3 2 4 4  Output: 0   Explanation Test Case 1 : 	In the first test case, one possible solution is you can remove 7, 8. 	So that minimum is 3 and maximum is 5. 	5 <= 2 * 3. 
  You're playing a video game, in which you will get an achievement if you complete all of the levels consecutively without dying. You can play the levels in any order, and each time you play a level you'll either complete it or die. Each level has some probability that you'll complete it, and takes some amount of time. In what order should you play the levels so that the expected time it takes you to get the achievement is minimized? Assume that it takes equally long to beat a level or to die in it, and that you will start again from the first level in your ordering as soon as you die.  Note: If you fail to complete a level, you do not personally die—only your character in the game dies. If that were not the case, only a few people would try to earn this achievement.     Input The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow, each of which consists of three lines. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N, the number of levels. The second line contains N space-separated integers Li. Li is the number of seconds level i lasts, which is independent of whether you complete the level or die. The third line contains N space-separated integers Pi. Pi is the percent chance that you will die in any given attempt to complete level i.   Output For each test case, output one line containing "Case #x: ", where x is the case number (starting from 1), followed by N space-separated integers. The jth integer in the list should be the index of the jth level you should attempt to beat in order to minimize the amount of time you expect to spend earning the achievement.  Indices go from 0 to N-1. If there are multiple orderings that would give the same expected time, output the lexicographically least ordering. Out of two orderings, the lexicographically smaller one is the one with the smaller index at the first location where they differ; out of many orderings, the lexicographically least one is the one that is lexicographically smaller than every other ordering.   Limits  1 = T = 100. 0 = Pi < 100.   Small dataset  1 = N = 20. Li = 1.   Sample  Input 3 4 1 1 1 1 50 0 20 20 3 100 10 1 0 50 0 3 100 80 50 40 20 80  Output Case #1: 0 2 3 1 Case #2: 1 0 2 Case #3: 2 0 1   Note that the second and third samples do not satisfy the constraints for the small input. 
  You are given two vectors v1=(x1,x2,...,xn) and v2=(y1,y2,...,yn). The scalar product of these vectors is a single number, calculated as x1y1+x2y2+...+xnyn.  Suppose you are allowed to permute the coordinates of each vector as you wish. Choose two permutations such that the scalar product of your two new vectors is the smallest possible, and output that minimum scalar product.    Input The first line of the input file contains integer number T - the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains integer number n. The next two lines contain n integers each, giving the coordinates of v1 and v2 respectively.  Output For each test case, output a line Case #X: Y where X is the test case number, starting from 1, and Y is the minimum scalar product of all permutations of the two given vectors.   Small dataset  T = 1000 1 = n = 8 -1000 = xi, yi = 1000   Sample  Input 2 3 1 3 -5 -2 4 1 5 1 2 3 4 5 1 0 1 0 1 Output Case #1: -25 Case #2: 6  
  I want to make an online poker website. A very important component of such a system is the random number generator. It needs to be fast and random enough. Here is a compromise I came up with. I need a way to generate random numbers of length at most D. My plan is to select a prime number P = 10D. I am also going to pick non-negative integers A and B. Finally, I'm going to pick an integer seed S between 0 and P-1, inclusive.  To output my sequence of pseudo-random numbers, I'm going to first output S and then compute the new value of S like this: S := (A*S + B) mod P.  Then I will output the new value of S as the next number in the sequence and update S again by using the same formula. I can repeat this as many times as I want.  Do you think that this is a good random number generator? Can you write a program that takes K consecutive elements of a sequence that was generated by my random number generator, and prints the next element of the sequence?     Input The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow. Each one starts with a line containing D and K. The next line contains K consecutive elements generated by a random number generator of the kind described above.  Output For each test case, output one line containing "Case #x: y", where x is the case number (starting from 1) and y is either the next number in the sequence, or the string "I don't know." if the answer is ambiguous.   Limits  1 = T = 100. 1 = K = 10. The K integers will be consecutive elements of a sequence generated by a random number generator of the type described above.   Small dataset 1 = D = 4.  Sample  Input 3 2 10 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 3 1 13 1 5 6 6 6 6 6 Output Case #1: 10 Case #2: I don't know. Case #3: 6  
  You receive a credit C at a local store and would like to buy two items. You first walk through the store and create a list L of all available items. From this list you would like to buy two items that add up to the entire value of the credit. The solution you provide will consist of the two integers indicating the positions of the items in your list (smaller number first).    Input The first line of input gives the number of cases, N. N test cases follow. For each test case there will be:  One line containing the value C, the amount of credit you have at the store.  One line containing the value I, the number of items in the store.  One line containing a space separated list of I integers. Each integer P indicates the price of an item in the store. Each test case will have exactly one solution.   Output For each test case, output one line containing "Case #x: " followed by the indices of the two items whose price adds up to the store credit. The lower index should be output first.  Limits  5 = C = 1000 1 = P = 1000   Small dataset  N = 10 3 = I = 100   Sample  Input 3 100 3 5 75 25 200 7 150 24 79 50 88 345 3 8 8 2 1 9 4 4 56 90 3 Output Case #1: 2 3 Case #2: 1 4 Case #3: 4 5  
 You will be given a string of lowercase English alphabet letters. You have to find two palindrome which are non-overlapping subsequences such that the product of their lengths is maximised.  (Subsequence: It is a string derived from deleting some elements without altering order. AC is a subsequence of ABCD; BA is not.)  Let's say P and Q be two subsequences. Pi and Pj are the indices of first and last characters of P, in basic string (Similar definition for Qi and Qj).They are non-overlapping if Pj < Qi. In other words, the first character in subsequence Q should come only after complete appearance of subsequence P.  Basic string can have almost 3200 characters.  I/p format: Input contain one string only(Sequence of non-separated characters).  output The product value for each String.  Sample Input: aaapaaskmywbcaajjaacb  Sample Output: 50  Reason: P:- aaaaa (5) Q:- bcaajjaacb (10) 5*10 = 50 
 Freakin' news has recently claimed that they have discovered a civilization on mars and that they have established contact with the martians. Following is a summary of the dawn hour breakin' news on freakin' news :  Occassionally, the martian ministers feel the need to please their king. For this purpose, they give the king a trivial problem to solve and heap excessive praise upon him when he presents the correct solution.  This time they have given the king the following problem : Given two positive integers n,k and n numbers a[1],a[2],...a[n] find the maximum of (b[1]a[1]+b[2]a[2]+.....b[n]a[n]) subject to the restrictions : 1) b[i] is either 1 or (-1), for all i, 1 ≤ i ≤ n. 2) Exactly k b[i]'s are 1. The remaining (n-k) b[i]'s are (-1).  To make the task even easier for the king, the ministers have given the king the sequence a[1],a[2],...a[n] sorted in non-decreasing order.   The king, being lazy, has outsourced the task to freakin' news. Your job is to do this task for freakin' news.   Input Format :  The first line of input contains a single integer n. The next line consists of n space seperated integers a[1], a[2], ... a[n]. The sequence a is guaranteed to be sorted in non-decreasing order.   Output Format :  On the only line of output, output a single integer : the maximum of (b[1]a[1]+b[2]a[2]+.....b[n]a[n]) subject to restrictions 1 and 2.   Constraints :  2 ≤ n ≤ 100 0 ≤ k ≤ n |a[i]| ≤ 1000 The sequence a is sorted in non-decreasing order i.e. a[1] ≤ a[2] ≤ .... ≤ a[n]   Sample Input : 2 1 -4 -4   Sample Output : 0   Sample Input : 2 0 -2 5   Sample Output : -3   Explanation : 1 : There are two possibilities for the sequence b : (+1,-1) and (-1,+1). Both lead to sum 0. 2 : There is only one possibility for the sequence b : (-1,-1). This leads to the sum -3. 
Freakin' news has recently claimed that they have discovered a civilization on mars and that they have established contact with the martians. Following is a summary of the breakfast hour breakin' news on freakin' news : The king of the martians wants to conduct a martian football tournament.  There are n football teams participating in the tournament numbered form 1,2,...n. The martian sports analysts have rated the teams according to footballing ability and team i has been assigned integer rating a[i]. (a[i]'s might be negative.)  The tournament is conducted as follows : A permutation f of (1,2,...n) is taken as reference. All pairs of teams with team numbers adjacent in the permutation f play exactly one match in the tournament. More formally, (n-1) matches are played in the tournament and the ith match is played between teams f(i) and f(i+1).  The disparity of a match is the absolute difference in the ratings of the two teams playing the match. The disparity of the tournament is the sum of the disparities of all matches in the tournament.  The king of the martians likes to see routs more than close contests and is therefore interested in maximizing the disparity. The king wants to select a permutation f so as to maximize the total disparity of the tournament.  For this purpose he has asked freakin' news to find out the maximum possible disparity of the tournament given the number of teams and their ratings. Your job is to do this task for freakin' news. [In case you were wondering who wins the tournament, the winner is the team which the queen thinks is the most adorable. That however, is irrelevant to your task.]   Input The first line of input contains a single integer n. The next line consists of n space seperated integers a[1], a[2], ... a[n] : the team ratings.   Output On the only line of output, output a single integer : the maximum possible disparity of the tournament.   Constraints 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000 |a[i]| ≤ 100000  Sample Input 1: 2 6 -4   Sample Output 1: 10   Sample Input 2: 3 3 5 7   Sample Output 2: 6   Explanation: 1 : Absolute disparity of 10 can be obtained by the permutations (1,2) and (2,1). 2 : Absolute disparity of 6 can be obtained by the permutations (1,3,2), (2,1,3), (2,3,1) and (3,1,2). Consider the permutation (2,1,3) in the second sample test case. The absolute disparity in this test case is | a[2]-a[1] | + | a[1]-a[3] | = |5-3| + |3-7| = 6 
Freakin' news has recently claimed that they have discovered a civilization on mars and that they have established contact with the martians. Following is a summary of the tea hour breakin' news on freakin' news : Every morning, the martian king determines his lucky number(s) for the day using the following unusual algorithm : Select a positive integer n. Write out a permutation f of (1,2,...n) on a board from left to right. (f(1) is leftmost, f(n) is rightmost). While 3 or more numbers remain on the board 	Erase all numbers at position i from the left for which i is a power of 2. The number(s) which remains(remain) at the end is(are) the lucky number(s) for the day.  (Note : It is trivial to prove that either 1 or 2 numbers remain at the end.)  The king has asked freakin' news to write a program which determines the lucky numbers for the day given n and f. Your job is to do this task for freakin' news.  Input The first line of input contains a single integer T : the number of test cases. Lines 2,3,...2T+1 describe the test cases (Test case i is described by the lines 2i and 2i+1). The first line of each test case contains the single integer n. The next line consists of n space seperated integers f(1), f(2), ... f(n). It is guaranteed that (f(1),f(2),...f(n)) is a permutation of (1,2,...n).  Output For each test case output a single line as follows : If 1 number remains at the end : 	On the only line of output, output a single integer : the lucky number for the day. If 2 numbers remain at the end : 	On the only line of output, output two space seperated integers : the two lucky numbers for the day. The two numbers must appear from left ro right in the same order in which they appeared in the input.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000 (f(1),f(2),...f(n)) is a permutation of (1,2,...n).

Freakin' news has recently claimed that they have discovered a civilization on mars and that they have established contact with the martians. Following is a summary of the midnight hour breakin' news on freakin' news : Playful Configuration A configuration of n coins placed in a 2 × n grid (2 rows, n columns) such that every column contains exactly one coin is called a playful configuration. (Coins can only be placed inside a cell, and not on the boundary of two cells. Every coin is facing either heads-up or tails-up.) One can update a playful configuration in the following ways : 1)  switch(i, j) , where 1<=i<=j<=n : For all integers r such that i<=r<=j, do the following : If there is a coin at (1, r), remove it and place it, facing same side up at (2, r). Otherwise remove the coin at (2, r) and place it, facing same side up at (1, r). 2)  flip(i, j) , where 1<=i<=j<=n : For all integers r such that i<=r<=j, do the following : Flip the coin in column r without changing its position. (If the coin is initially facing heads-up then after flipping it will face tails-up and vice versa.) One can query a playful configuration in the following way : query(i, j) , where 1<=i<=j<=n : Let h1 be the number of integers r such that i<=r<=j and there is a coin facing heads-up at (1,r). Let h2 be the number of integers r such that i<=r<=j and there is a coin facing heads-up at (2,r). Let t1 be the number of integers r such that i<=r<=j and there is a coin facing tails-up at (1,r). Let t2 be the number of integers r such that i<=r<=j and there is a coin facing tails-up at (2,r). query(i, j) returns h1,h2,t1 and t2. The king of mars plays the following game every month : He arranges n coins in a playful configuration. Initially all coins are in the first row (facing either heads-up or tails-up). He periodically performs operations on the configurations. Each operation is either an update (flip or switch) or a query. Any player who responds correctly to each query wins a large prize. Unfortunately, the game is too difficult and no player has yet won the coveted prize.  This month however, one of the ministers has gained access to the initial configuration as well as a list of all the operations. The minister has asked freakin' news to help him answer all queries correctly. Your job is to do this task for freakin' news.  Input Format The first line contains a single integer n : The number of coins in the playful configuration.  The next line contains n space seperated integers f[1],f[2],...f[n] which describe the inital state of the coins. The coin in column i is initially at (1,i). If f[i] is 1, the coin at (1,i) is initially facing heads-up. Otherwise, the coin at (1,i) is initially facing tails-up.  The next line contains a single integer m : The number of operations.  The k'th of the next m lines contains 3 integers op,i,j which describe the k'th operation. Each operation is described as follows : If op is 0, the operation is query(i,j). If op is 1, the operation is flip(i,j). If op is 2, the operation is switch(i,j).  Output Format  For each query, the program must output a single line consisting of 4 space seperated integers h1, h2, t1 and t2.  Constraints  1<=n<=100000 Each f[i] is either 0 or 1. 1<=m<=100000 For each operation, op is either 0,1 or 2. For each operation, 1<=i<=j<=n.

  Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans are available in f different flavours, numbered from 1 to f. (Contrary to intution, f is finite. In fact 2<=  f <=10^8.) One of the displays of Bertie Botts Every Flavour Beans at the Leaky Cauldron has N (1<= N <=10^8) slots numbered from 1 to N arranged in a sequence. Each slot can contain a jar full of beans of the same flavour. Currently, the display consists of alternating jars of flavours 1 and 2 starting with a jar of flavour 1. It is desired to transform it to one consisting of alternating jars of flavours 1 and 2 starting with a jar of flavour 2. For example if N In one operation, one can pick a slot s (1<= s <=N) and a flavour e (1<= e <=f) and replace the jar currently at slot s with a jar of beans of flavour e. Since, the primary selling point of the beans is the variety of flavours available, all states of the display in which two adjacent slots contain jars with beans of same flavour are undesirable. All other states are desirable. Your task is to find the minimum number of operations which convert the initial state to the target state such that all intermediate states of the display are desirable.  Input The first line of input contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. T lines of input follow, each containing two space-seperated integers, N and f.  Output Output should consist of T lines. Each line must contain a single integer, the answer to the ith test case.  Constraints 1<=T<=1000 1<=N<=10^8 2<=f<=10^8   Example Input: 2 4 5 5 2  Output: 6 -1   Explanation 1) One optimal sequence of operations is as follows: (1,2,1,2)->(1,3,1,2)->(1,3,4,2)->(2,3,4,2)->(2,3,4,1)->(2,1,4,1)->(2,1,2,1). 2) Since only 2 flavours are available, it is easy to see that the desired transformation from (1,2,1,2,1) to (2,1,2,1,2) cannot be realised. 
As a project for her arithmancy class, Hermoine has designed a magical plate which contains a sequence of N numbers which permutes according to a fixed permutation everyday. We denote the sequence of numbers on the ith day as A[i][1], A[i][2], ... A[i][N].f[1],f[2]...f[N] is a fixed permutation of (1,2,..N). The sequence A[i+1][1],A[i+1][2],...A[i+1][N] is the result of applying the permutation f[1],f[2],..f[N] to the sequence A[i][1],A[i][2],...A[i][N]. See the sample input for clarity. The arithmancy teacher has asked Hermoine to report the sequence of numbers that she started with. Hermoine has forgotten the original sequence. Ron wants to impress Hermoine because well, she's gorgeous! He knows the number of days K that have passed since the design of the magical plate, the current sequence of numbers and the fixed permutation f. He now wants to find out the original sequence of integers on the magical plate.  Input The first line of input contains a single integer T, the total number of test cases. 3*T lines follow, 3 corresponding to each test case. The first line of each test case contains 2 space-seperated integers N,K. The second line contains N space-seperated integers : A[K][1], A[K][2], ... A[K][N]. The third line also contains N space-seperated integers : f[1], f[2], ... f[N]. It is guaranteed that f[1],f[2],...f[N] is a permutation of (1,2,...N).   Output The output must consist of T lines, one corresponding to each test case. Corresponding to each test case output in a single line N space-seperated integers : A[0][1], A[0][2], .. A[0][N]. It is trivial to note that the solution exists and is unique.  Constraints 1 <= T <= 10 1 <= N <= 1000 0 <= K < N 1 <= A[K][i] <= 10^9 1 <= f[i] <= N f[i] != f[j] for all i,j st 1 <= i < j <= N.    Example Input: 1 5 2 200 100 500 300 400 3 4 5 1 2  Output: 100 500 300 400 200   Explanation (100,500,300,400,200) -> (300,400,200,100,500) -> (200,100,500,300,400)  
Recently, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry has introduced a course on coumputer programming! As a result, many programming duels now take place in Hogwarts. Lucius Malfoy has challenged Harry Potter to one such programming duel.  The rules of the duel are as follows: 1) Malfoy chooses two integers N(>0) and K( ≥ 0) and a sequence S of N positive integers. 2) Harry must find the number of distinct non-empty subsequences L of S such that no two integers in L have an absolute difference greater than K. Since this number may be very large, Harry must report this number modulo (10^9+7).  Input Input will begin with an integer T, the total number of test cases. Description of T test cases follows. Each test case is described by two lines of input. The first line of each test case will consist of two space-seperated integers : N,K. The second line will contain N space seperated integers : S[1],S[2], ... S[N].  Output For each test case output a single integer : The number that Harry must report to Malfoy.  Constraints 1 <= T <=5 1 <= N <= 10^5 0 <= K <= 10^9 1 <= S[i] <=10^9  Example Input:  2 3 1 10 11 12 5 6 12 27 1 13 14  Output:  5 9   Explanation CASE 1 : Possible subsequences : (10), (11), (12), (10,11), (11,12). CASE 2 : Possible subsequences : (12), (27), (1), (13), (14), (12,13), (12,14), (13,14), (12,13,14). 
Voldemort has now cast a new kind of spell named 'Illusio'. This spell creates the illusion that he is at multiple locations at the same time. Since Harry does not know the location of the real Voldemort, he must destroy all his illusions in order to win. Assume there is a 2-dimensional square grid with illusions spread across it. Outside the grid, on the boundary, stands Harry Potter. Harry can quickly reach the exterior of any row or column and cast a spell which will destroy all the illusions in that row or column. Realizing that he has very little strength left, he must cast as few spells as possible and destroy all the illusions. Your job is to help him determine the minimum number of spells he will need to destroy all the illusions in the grid and win the duel.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer N denoting the length of the square grid. The second line contains an integer T denoting the total number of illusions in the grid. Then follow T lines, the ith of which contains 2 space-separated integers R[i] and C[i] denoting the (1-based) row and column coordinates of the ith illusion.  Output A single integer denoting the minimum number of spells needed to destroy all of Voldemort's illusions as per the problem statement.  Constraints 1 <= N <= 100 1 <= T <= N*N 1 <= R[i], C[i] <= N For all 1 <= i < j <= T, either R[i]!=R[j] or C[i]!=C[j], that is to say that the locations of all the T illusions are distinct  Example Input: 4 3 1 3 2 1 4 3  Output: 2   Explanation Since the illusions at (1,3) and (4,3) are both located in column 3, they can be destroyed with a single spell if Harry casts it on column 3. The illusion at (2,1) can be destroyed with another spell either by casting it on row 2 or column 1. This makes a total of 2 spells. It is easy to see that 2 is the least possible number.  
  John Watson always knew that one of the favourite hobbies of Sherlock Holmes was to tinker with ciphers. Though Watson was not that good with ciphers, he learnt a few  things being with him. Right now, Watson is in trouble! He has been locked in a room and the only way to get out of the room is through deciphering a known string to get the password. With his knowledge, he finds out that a given string S can be deciphered with a given cipher array A (1-based index) of same length N as follows: Starting from first number in A (i.e. i=1) the 'i'th character in S, has to be swapped with A[i]th character in S.

  Watson, from one of his programmer friends, finds out about the site codechef. Fascinated by the questions, he decides to make a question himself. He defines a pair of numbers (x,y) a perfect pair if at least one of the numbers is greater than a given number K. Now he wants to find out that given an array A (1-based index) of size N, and an operation (defined below) what should be the minimum number of operations required to make every possible pair in the array perfect. The only operation which can be done on the array is as follows: Select two distinct indices i, j (1 <= i <= N and 1 <= j <= N) and replace one of A[i] or A[j] with A[i]*A[j]. Now he challenged Sherlock to solve this problem. As Sherlock is busy with his cases, help him to find the answer.     Input  First line contains no of test cases T. Each test case has 2 lines. First line has two integers N and K seperated by space. Second line has N numbers seperated by space, where ith integer is A[i].    Output  For each test case, print in a single line, the minimum number of operations required for that case. If it is not possible to make every pair in an array perfect then output -1.     Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 2 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 0 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10^9 0 ≤ K ≤ 10^9 Sum of N across all the test cases in a test file does not exceed 10^6     Example Input:  2 5 25 4 3 2 1 5 5 25 0 0 3 4 5   Output:  5 -1  
   After a long series of jobless days, Sherlock and Watson frustated by the lack of new cases, decide to turn their minds toward something interesting like solving few logical problems. One of the problems they have to solve now is as follows: Given an array A of size N and a list of Q number of queries, where each query has two numbers L and R, find for each query the number of inversions in the subarray from Lth to Rth position (both inclusive) of the array A( array has 1-based index). For an array A two elements A[i] and A[j] form an inversion if A[i] > A[j] and i < j. Help them to solve this problem.     Input  First line contains a single integer, length N of the array. Second line has N space separated numbers, where ith element is A[i]. Third line has a single integer Q. Next Q lines have 2 space separated integers L and R of that query.   Output  Output Q lines, ith line having a single integer, the answer to the ith query     Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 20000 0 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10^9 1 ≤ Q ≤ 20000 1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ N     Example Input:  7 7 9 3 5 1 6 4 4 1 4 3 5 1 2 1 7   Output:  4 2 0 14  
   Sherlock and Moriarity are again back in game. This time Moriarity transformed himself as an impersonator and made his own K number of clones, each of them hidden at K different locations in the City. Sherlock observed that City, having N number of locations, has the structure of a tree with N number of nodes and each node represents a distinct location in the city. Now Sherlock is interested in finding the total number of subtrees which contain all the K locations where Moriarity's clones are hidden. Help him find the answer. Since the answer can be very large, print the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.  Note : In this problem, the tree is unrooted, so a subtree simply means a connected subset of nodes.  Input  The first line of input contains the number of test cases T. T test cases follow: For each test case, first line contains N, the total number of locations. Next N-1 lines contains two numbers u and v, signifying there is a path between u and v. Next line contains K, followed by distinct K number of locations where Moriarity's clones are hidden.   Output  For each test case, output in a single line the total number of subtrees which contain all the K locations where Moriarity's clones are hidden.     Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 0 ≤ K ≤ N     Example Input:  1 4 1 2 2 3 3 4 2 2 4   Output:  2  
   Sherlock: "Why are you doing this?" Moriarty: "I like to watch you dance." Sherlock is now facing the biggest challenge of his life. Having placed bombs in various important checkpoints in London, Moriarty is planning to have more than his share of fun. Sherlock has deduced that the checkpoints form a network with the property that it is possible to reach any checkpoint from any other checkpoint, using a unique path. Moriarty has assigned an initial value to every checkpoint. Furthermore, he can choose any pair of checkpoints (A,B), and add a constant C to the value of every checkpoint on the path from A to B (both inclusive). This addition is done modulo 10. At any point of time, Moriarty can ask Sherlock to answer how many checkpoints on the path between a given pair of checkpoints (both inclusive), have a prime number value. Even a minor error in Sherlock’s answers, will lead to the bombs being triggered. Realizing the intensity and magnitude of the task, Sherlock decides to outsmart Moriarty by writing a computer program. It is your job to help Sherlock protect London from destruction.     Input  The first line of the input contains the number of checkpoints in the network: N The second line contains N space separated integers Vi denoting the initial value of every checkpoint The next N-1 lines contain space-separated integers u v, to signify an edge between checkpoints u and v The next line contains the number of operations: Q The next Q lines each contain one of two types of operations given below:  0 A B – This denotes a query operation to return the count of prime values on checkpoints in the unique path from checkpoint A to checkpoint B (both inclusive). 1 A B C – This denotes an update operation of adding C to the value on each of the vertices on the unique path from checkpoint A to checkpoint B (both inclusive). This addition is performed modulo 10.   Output  For each query of the form 0 A B, print on a separate line, the total number of primes on vertices in the unique path from A to B (both inclusive).     Constraints  2 ≤ N ≤ 100000 0 ≤ V[i] ≤ 9 1 ≤ u,v ≤ N 1 ≤ Q ≤ 100000 1 ≤ A,B ≤ N 1 ≤ C ≤ 10000 A is not equal to B     Example Input:  10 1 0 0 9 1 7 2 3 3 7 3 7 1 8 10 5 8 4 5 1 9 7 6 7 2 7 7 4 5 0 1 10 0 2 4 0 4 10 1 5 3 3714 0 1 8    Output:  1 1 2 2   
 A country has V cities. Certain pairs of cities are connected by undirected transport roads between them. There are E such transport roads. There exists a sequence of roads connecting every city in the the country to every other city. Among the V cities, K of the cities are good cities.   Initially all the cities are free. The country is ruled by two kings. The first king wants no friendship with the second king, while the other king wants friendship with the first king. They now play a game of conquering cities.   The first king selects a good city, then the second king selects a good city and so on; until all the good cities are over. Suppose at the end some good cities belong to kingdom A and others to B. Distance value between the two kingdoms is defined as the sum of shortest distances between each pair of good cities X and Y such that X belongs to A and Y belongs to B.   The first king wants to maximize the distance value and other king wants to minimize this. Assuming that both play optimally, find out the distance value after the end of the game.   Input  First line contain three space separated integers denoting V, E, and  K respectively.   For next E lines, each line contain 3 space separated integers, u v w, denoting that there is an edge from u to v of length w.   The following line contains K space separated integers denoting the indices of the good cities. Indices are given by using 1 based indexation.   Output  A single integer, the maximum possible distance that can be achieved if both kings play optimally.  Constraints  2 ≤ V ≤ 200 No constraint on E 2 ≤ K ≤ 12 0 ≤ w ≤ 100 1 ≤ u, v ≤ V No two u, v pairs repeat in input.   Example Input: 4 5 3 1 2 5 1 3 2 1 4 3 2 4 2 3 4 2 1 2 4   Output: 7 
   Awesomeness of a string is defined by a pair of a character C and an integer F,  satisfying the following conditions :   C must belong to the  given string S and there must be a substring subS of S having length equal to F such that all the characters in subS are equal to c.   F should be as large as possible.    	Your aim is to maximize the value of F. If there are more than one c whose maximum F value is same than you need to chose the character c 	with minimum ascii value.   	For example let’s take S = abbbaaabad. subS is written in bold.   Take c = ‘a’ : Maximum possible F value is 3 (abbbaaabad).   Take c = ‘b’: Maximum possible F value is 3 (abbbaaabad).   Take c = ‘d’: Maximum possible F value is 1 (abbbaaabad).    So that awesomeness of  abbbaaabad is defined by c = ‘a’ and F = 3. First priority is to maximize the value of F (we prefered 3 over 1). If there are more than one c whose maximum F value is same then we prefer the c with minimum ascii value (we prefered ‘a’ over ‘b’).   You will be given a string and you need to find its awesomeness.   Input  Only line of the input will contain a string S.   Output  Output two lines. First line should contain value of c, whereas second line should contain value of F.   Constraints  1 ≤ length of string S ≤ 10^5  S contains only lowercase alphabets of English Language (i.e. from 'a' to 'z').   Example Input: abbbaaabad  Output: a 3  Explanation Example case 1. Example taken from problem statement 
 A country has N cities with certain population in each city. These cities are internally connected by two-way power cables. Among them, K cities have powerhouses. If a powerhouse is in a city, or is connected to another city via cables, directly or indirectly, you can provide electricity to that city, if you own the powerhouse. Initially X (X≤K) of the powerhouses are owned by you. Each powerhouse costs something, and the cost is given to you. You can sell any power house that you own, at the cost of the powerhouse. You can buy a powerhouse which you don’t yet own, at it’s mentioned cost, if you have enough money. In your bank account you have some money, say M (apart from the powerhouses you own). You want to satisfy maximum number of people, by buying and selling appropriate powerhouses. Find the maximum number of people that can be satisfied.  Input   First line of the input contains three space separated integers N , E and K. N represents number of cities, E denotes the number of connections and K represents number of cities having powerhouses.    Next E lines each contains two integers u and v representing that there is a connection between city u and city v. There won’t be any duplicate connection. u won’t be equal to v.    Next line contains N space separated integers denoting the population of each city.    Next line contains K space separated integers. Each integers denote a city containing powerhouse. All K cities will be distinct and valid. Powerhouses are numbered from 1 to K (in the order in which they are provided).    Next line contains K space separated integers denoting the cost of the corresponding powerhouse (ith integer denotes the cost of the ith powerhouse).    Next line contains two integers X and M. X represents number of powerhouses that you own and M represents the amount of money that you have in your bank account.    Next line contains X space separated integers denoting which of the X powerhouses among the given K powerhouses you own. Integer X_i means you  own X_i th powerhouse.   Output  One integer in a single line denoting the maximum number of people that you can satisfy.   Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 100000 1 ≤ u, v ≤ N 1 ≤ E ≤ 200000 1 ≤ K ≤ 31  1≤ X ≤ K  1 ≤ X_i ≤ K Population of each city will be less than or equal to 1000000 Cost of a powerhouse will be less than or equal to 1000000000. 0 ≤ M ≤ 32000000000   Example Input: 6 6 2 1 2 1 3 1 4 2 4 3 4 5 6 5 3 11 7 2 18 4 5 115 100 1 14 2 Output: 20   Explanation   There are 6 cities numbered from 1 to 6 having population at the cities 5, 3, 11, 7, 2 and 18 respectively.  2 cities, city 4 and city 5 contains powerhouse. Cost of the powerhouse located at city 4 is 115 and cost of the powerhouse located at city 5 is 100.  Powerhouses are numbered. Meaning 1st powerhouse corresponds to powerhouse located at city 4 and 2nd powerhouse corresponds to the powerhouse located at city 5.  You own one of the powerhouses and have additional balance of 100 in your bank account.  2 in the next line means you own the 2nd powerhouse (i.e., powerhouse located at city 5 having cost 100).  Since you already own powerhouse 2 and you do not have suffcient balance to buy powerhouse 1 (because it costs 115 but you have only 14 in your account. You can not buy that powerhouse even if you sell the powerhouse that you own. Because that will fetch you only 100 more so you will have total of 114 which is not enough to buy the first poerhouse).  Since the 2nd poerhouse, that you own, is connected to city 5 and city 6 you can satisfy atmost 2 + 18 = 20 people.  
 Electric town has only N electricity powerhouses. All these powerhouses do is generate power and transmit it to other powerhouses.   Also there are unidirectional power cables between these powerhouses. These cables go in one direction from powerhouse X to powerhouse Y.   Each of these cables also have a maximum integral capacity, which is an upper limit on the amount of power they can transfer. These capacities will be given.   Now, say a powerhouse receives R amount of power from other powerhouses, and gives out a total of S amount of power out to other powerhouses. Further, suppose it generates G amount of power. Then the amount of power going out of the powerhouse should be the sum of the power it receives, and the power it generates. That is, S = R + G. Since electric town is a very advanced town, G could be anything (non negative).   You are Jaylal, a mafia in the town, and you have a special superconducting (again unidirectional) cable. This cable has infinite capacity, and can hence transfer any amount of electricity. You can connect this cable between from powerhouse A to powerhouse B, and since you control this cable, you will obtain the electricity that flows through this cable. You add this cable to the network, and the powerhouses continue to transmit power in the same fashion as before, without noticing that there is another cable.   Of course you want to be able to get the maximum electricity. What is the maximum electricity that could be travelling in this cable? You have to answer this question T times, for T different pairs of powerhouses A, B that you connect this cable in. All these answers have to be independently outputted. (see sample)  Input  First line of the input contains two space separated integers N and M denoting the number of powerhouses and number of cables respectively.   For next M lines, each line contains three sapce separated integers U V W, denoting that there is a cable directed from powerhouse U to powerhouse V with electric capacity W.   A single line containing an integer T :  the number of different layouts of the superconducting cable you are going to try out.  T  lines follow, each containing two integers A and B denoting that the cable is connected from  B to A .  Output  Output T lines each containing a single integer corresponding to the maximum electricity you can hijack in that case case.   Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 300 1 ≤ M ≤ N * (N - 1) / 2  1 ≤ W ≤ 10^6 1 ≤ U, V ≤ N 0 ≤ G, G is unbounded from above (not given in input) There won’t be any duplicate edge or self loop (apart from the extra edge you added of infinite capacity)  1 ≤ T ≤ 10  1 ≤ A, B ≤ N  A != B   Example Input: 3 2 1 2 5 2 3 3 2 1 3 1 2  Output: 3 5

 There are 6 piles of stones in a round configuration. In a single move, a player selects 3 consecutive piles, and removes some stones from 1 or more of these piles. (at least 1 stone must be removed from at least 1 pile).   A player loses if he can’t make any more moves in the current position. (equivalently, there do not exist any piles with non-zero amount of stones)   Given a starting position, output whether it is a winning or a losing position for the first player.   The game is a two players game and they play alternatively.   Note that even if a pile becomes empty, it still exists in the game as an empty pile. When selecting consecutive piles, one of them maybe an empty pile.   Input  6 space separated integers on a line containing the initial number of stones in each pile.

 You are a bird shooting enthusiast. You are standing on position 0 and a flock of birds (assume infinitely many birds) is flying away from you at 1m/s. The flock of birds is initially at 1m away from you.   Your rating is (P, N) and your time lag is (T, R). This means the following.   If P is your precision rating : At every turn, beginning when the birds are at 1m position, you take a shot at one of the birds in the flock.

 This is the story of Chaapu, who is off on a business trip to New York, and takes your advice on how to come up with algorithmic solutions for his day to day problems.  Well you know how it is customary to "bring" things from the US to India, as they are apparently cheaper. Our mature Chaapu has bought N gifts and parcels for every member of his family. His return flight to India  is in a few days, and as the luggage load will be huge, he has decided to send these gifts and parcels through a courier service. The courier service has M channels, each of which can be used to send only one parcel. However, each channel has different delivery time for each of the gifts/parcels. To make sure that most of the gifts have arrived by the time Chaapu gets home, he has decided that atleast K gifts should get delivered before he takes the return flight. You are given a matrix A with A[i][j] representing the delivery time for gift/parcel i through channel j. You have to output the minimum time T required so that at least K gifts/parcels are delivered in time T.  Input The first line of the input contains N, M, K respectively.Rest of the N lines contain M integers each denoting the time required as explained above.  Output Output the minimum time required T as mentioned.  Constraints   1 <= N,M <= 100 1 <= A[i][j] <= 10^12 1 <= K <=M,N    Example  Input: 2 3 1 1 2 3 3 2 1  Output: 1  Explanation  We can use the first channel to send the first gift.  
  Recently Abhilash came across a game called DOTS. It is a single player game. The rules of the game are as follows :    N  *  M  dots of various colours are arranged in a  N  x  M  grid. See  here  for example.   You can draw a  rectilinear  curve over dots of same colour by moving your finger over the dots. See  here for better understanding. As soon as you lift your finger from the screen of your phone, all the dots that you joined to form the curve vanishes. Let's say  X  dots vanished in this step. This means that you earned  X  points in this step. In the example,  X  = 6 dots vanishes in the current step.   The aim of the game is to maximize your score in certain number of moves (in his phone it is 30).   However, if you are able to draw a curve which forms a loop then all the dots of that colour vanish from the board. See  here  for example. In the example all the green dots will disappear. Let's say  X  dots vanished in this step (in the example X = 9). This means you have earned  X  points in this step.    Abhilash's claim is  that greedy strategy is the best strategy to get high scores as you don't know what dots will come up in next step of your game. Using his strategy, he recently broke my highest record !    To break his record, I am planning to write a program. Will you help me ?   In this problem, configuration of the grid will be given and you are required to print the maximum points that you can earn in the current move. There are  K  different available colours denoted by integers ranging from 1 to K .   Input First line of the input contains two space separated integers N and  M .

 This problem is simple. You will be given an integer  N  and you need to factorize that number. To help you with factorization of  N , you will also be given  phi(N) .   phi(x)  is also known as Euler's Totient  function.  phi(x)  is defined as number of positive integers less than or equal to x which are relatively prime to  x  (i.e, greatest common divisor is 1).   Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.  The only line of each test case contains two space separated integers representing N and  phi(N)  respectively. N  denotes the number to be factorized.   Output  For each test case, output a single line containing the prime factors of  N  in non decreasing order. See example for clarity.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 20 2 ≤ N ≤ 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 (10^18)   Example Input: 3 8 4 36 12 450 120  Output: 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 2 3 3 5 5  
  You are given e even and o odd numbers. In a single operation, you change an even to odd number or vice versa. Find out min number of operations needed to do such that ratio of even to odd numbers becomes 2 : 3. If it is impossible to do so, output -1.   Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. For each test case, there will be a single line of input containing two space separated integers e and o.   Output  For each test case, output a single line containing a single integer corresponding to the answer of the problem.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ e, o ≤ 10^9   Example Input: 3 2 3 3 2 3 3 Output: 0 1 -1  Explanation Example case 1. Ratio of even : odd numbers are already 2 : 3. So no need of any operation. Example case 2. Change one even to odd, you will have 2 even and 3 odd satisfying the ratio. So only 1 operation is needed. Example case 3. There is no way of doing operations which could make desired ratio. 
  As we know that nowadays little Chef is travelling a lot ! One day, Little chef went to a mysterious country. The structure of the country can be described by a 2-D grid. Where each cell of the grid represents a town. Therefore, we can represent any town by a pair of integers (x, y). Which means that the town is located at the x^th row (0  ≤ x) and  y^th column (0  ≤ y) of the grid.  Moreover, for transportation in the country, there are roads connecting the towns. Roads can be understood as a vertical and horizontal lines passing through each cell (towns) of the grid. See  here  for better understanding of the structure of the country.   In some of the towns there are petrol pumps for refuelling. To be precise, there are  N  towns where petrol pumps are available. Let us number those towns from 1 to  N .   Little chef is currently at town 1 with his car having no fuel. He has to go to town  N . Available petrol in each petrol pump will be given. Formally let's denote that the i^th petrol pump has pi units of petrol. Little chef has a lot of money so he can buy any amount of petrol, if available. Obviously he can't buy petrol if it is not available !   However, in this country you are only allowed to move in two directions ! Formally if you are at town (x, y) then you can go to town (x1, y1) only if :  x = x1 and y1 > y or y = y1 and x1 > x . This is not the only rule that Chef has to follow ! Others rules that need to be followed as well are :  He must travel in the roads. He can not make a turn in a town where there is no petrol pump ! He can not stop in a town where there is no petrol pump. To take a turn, you must first stop at the point of turning. If he want to refuel his car, he must stop at a petrol pump.   The most mysterious thing about the country is that consumption of fuel is not proportional to the distance travelled ! Rather, total of only K units of petrol is consumed between two stoppage! However, it is impossible to continuously ride the car for a distance more than  L  without taking a stop. Distance between two towns (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|.   Little Chef simply wants to plan his travel from town 1 to town N. He already has the map of the country and he is aware of the rules. But, he got confused with so many rules! So he asked you for help. Can you help him ? You need to find a valid path for the Chef from town 1 to town N.   Input  First line of the input contains three space separated N, K and L.  N denotes the number of towns with petrol pumps. K denotes the units of petrol that is needed between two consecutive stops as described in the problem. L denotes the maximum distance that can be travelled in a continuous ride.    Next N lines contains three space separated integers each. Let's say that i^th line contains xi, yi and pi respectively. These integers denote :  (xi, yi) denotes the location of the  i^th petrol pump. pi denotes the amount of petrol available at the i^th petrol pump.     Output  If it is not possible for the Chef to reach to town N then print in a single line "NO" without quotes. Otherwise in the first line print "YES\n". In the second line print the number of cities where the Chef stopped including town 1 and town N. Let's say you printed  M . Then print M lines each containing two space separated integers denoting the location of the stoppage. All the stoppage should be printed in the same order in which they were visited. In the last line print the amount of fuel left in Chef's car after he stopped at the town N. Assume that he will not use the petrol pump of town N. See example and explanation for better understanding.  Note that multiple answers are possible. Any of the correct solution will be accepted !  Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 300000 1 ≤ K ≤ 1000 1 ≤ pi ≤ 1000 1 ≤ L ≤ 1000000 0 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 100001     Example Input: 7 4 8 1 1 7 4 10 3 10 1 1 10 4 8 6 1 4 5 5 6 10 10 4  Output: YES 5 1 1 6 1 10 1 10 4 10 10 4  Input: 7 4 4 1 1 7 4 10 3 10 1 1 10 4 8 6 1 4 5 5 6 10 10 4  Output: NO     Explanation Example case 1. One of the possible solution can be like the following :-  Chef filled 7 unit of fuel at town 1. Since a continuous ride of 8 unit is allowed, it is valid to take a stop at town 5. Total fuel left at this point is 7 - 4 = 3 units. Then the Chef fills 4 units of fuel here. Now, total fuel in his tank = 7 units. Again he stops at town 3 for taking a turn. It is valid to stop here as there is a petrol pump here. Since, he has stopped here, he fills 1 unit of petrol here as well. Now, he has 7 - 4 + 1 = 4 units of fuel in his tank. Next stoppage he takes is town 4. This was possible because he had 4 units of fuel in his tank earlier. However, it was not possible for him to directly go to town 7 from 3 as it is a distance of 9 units which is greater than L = 8 . He fills his tank here as well. Now fuel he has = 4 - 4 + 8 = 8 units. Next, he directly stops at N = 7 with still 4 units of fuel in his tank. For this example, it is the only possible solution.  
 Devu found a 2-D matrix filled with Capital English Alphabets ('A' to 'Z') lying around in Churu's lab. He got very fascinated with the matrix and asked Churu to give the matrix to him so that he can play with it. Churu, although being a nice guy was not so nice to him, and asked him a puzzle and promised to give it to him only if Devu solves the puzzle correctly. Devu really wanted to have the matrix  so he asks you for help. Will you help him ?  The puzzle is to count the number of sub-matrices containing exactly K distinct letters.   Input  The first line of the input contains two space separated integers N and K. N denotes the size of the matrix i.e., the matrix is a square N x N matrix. K is as explained in the problem statement.   Output  Output the the number of such sub-matrices  in a single line.   Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 100 1 ≤ K ≤ 26   Example Input: 4 1 ABAB BABA ABBA BAAB  Output: 20  
 The country of Byteland has  N  cities. There are roads across certain pair of cities. There are exactly N-1 such roads. The roads are such that it is possible to go from any city to any other city using those N-1 roads.  One day Little chef and his brother Big chef decided to have a car race. Choosing the starting city and destination city was a big problem. Finally they settled with the following plan:  The starting point (source) of the race will be selected randomly and uniformly among the  N  cities. Destination point will be selected such that it is farthest from the source so as to have fair chance for both to show their talent !  Little chef is wondering about what will be the expected distance to be traveled during the race ? He is seeking your help. Can you help him out ?  Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of cities in Byteland. Next N-1 lines each contains two space-separated integers u and v. Denoting that there is a road connecting city u and city v. The distance between them is 1.   Output  For each test case, output a single line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. That is the expected distance of the race. Your answer will be considered correct within absolute or relative error of 10^-6.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ N ≤ 200,000 Input will be such that it is possible to go from any city to any other city using the given roads.   Example Input: 1 6 1 2 2 3 3 4 3 6 2 5  Output: 2.66666666667   Explanation Since the source city is selected at uniform and randomly, probability of selection of each city is 1/6. Hence, the answer will be the sum of "distance of the farthest city" from each node multiplied by 1/6.  Warning : Large Input, be careful while reading Input !  
 Chef was feeling bored so he decided to create a pattern to play with. His pattern always has 1  as its first element. Then he chooses a number K as the second element. After selecting K as his second number he creates next element in the pattern by multiplying all previously existing elements of the pattern.  Now he asks for your help to find the  Nth  element in his pattern. As his number can be very large, so output modulo 10^9 + 7.   Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.  The only line of each test case contains two space separated integers K and  N  as described in the problem statement.

  Wonderland Showroom is a a top neclace designer showroom in town . It's known for designing neclaces as customer wishes .A neclace is composed of a number of coloured beads. The colour of the beads is denoted by a lower case english alphabet for simplicity and design conventions. Alice is very fond of jewellery and wishes to purchase a "special" neclace on her birthday . Alice considers a neclace to be "special" if the following conditions are satisfied : 1. All the bead colours occurring odd number of times are placed first and then the bead colurs occurring even number of times. 2. The bead colors must also be in lexographically correct order. 3. All similar beads must occur together. The Wonderland showroom has already pre-designed neclace sets. But to ensure that Alice purchases the neclace from their showroom they need to redesign the neclaces to make it appear "special" . You are the chief designer in-charge. Can you redesign the beads to make it appear special ?  Note: String A is lexicographically smaller than string B if at the first position where A and B differ A contains a letter which is earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in B.     Input The first line contains a single positive integer T . T test cases follow. Each line of the test cases contains a string s.  Output For each test case output one line containing the "special" neclace that suits the requirements of Alice.  Constraints  1<=T<=100 1<=Length of string<=1000     Example Input: 2 abaabccd aaaabbb  Output: aaadbbcc bbbaaaa    Explanation Example case 1. The frequency of each character is as follows 1. a occurs 3 times . 2. b occurs 2 times . 3. c occurs 2 times . 4. d occurs 1 times .  We need to place the beads occuring odd number of times at the beginning and in lexographical order. 'a' and 'd' are the only beads occuring odd number of times. 'a' occurs before 'd' in lexographical order. So, we have ---> aaad Now, we need to place the beads occuring even number of times and in lexographical order. 'b' and 'c' occur even number of times So, we have ---> aaad + bbcc = aaadbbcc

Despite indications to the contrary, India too has had its share of UFOs. There is enormous debate in UFO circles about the veracity of sightings of UFOs in the Aksai Chin area near Kashmir.  A naughty local wanted to play truant and decided to set up a fake UFO base. To generate interest, he decided to draw square number patterns on the ground. The general pattern of the square was as follows:     1   2   3   4   5    6   7  8 28 29 48 47 46 45 44  9 27 30 49 50 51 52 43 10 26 31 60 61 64 53 42 11 25 32 59 62 63 54 41 12 24 33 58 57 56 55 40 13 23 34 35 36 37 38 39 14 22 21 20 19 18 17 16 15   You need to write a program to generate such a square for a given input N.   Input N = the size of the side of a square you should generate  Output An NxN square according to the rules described above  Example  Input: 8  Output: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 28 29 48 47 46 45 44 9 27 30 49 50 51 52 43 10 26 31 60 61 64 53 42 11 25 32 59 62 63 54 41 12 24 33 58 57 56 55 40 13 23 34 35 36 37 38 39 14 22 21 20 19 18 17 16 15  
Stepford Street was a dead end street. The houses on Stepford Street were bought by wealthy millionaires. They had them extensively altered so that as one progressed along the street, the height of the buildings increased rapidly. However, not all millionaires were created equal. Some refused to follow this trend and kept their houses at their original heights. The resulting progression of heights was thus disturbed.  A contest to locate the most ordered street was announced by the Beverly Hills Municipal Corporation. The criteria for the most ordered street was set as follows:  If there exists a house with a lower height later in the street than the house under consideration, then the pair (current house, later house) counts as 1 point towards the disorderliness index of the street. It is not necessary that the later house be adjacent to the current house.   Note: No two houses on a street will be of the same height   For example, for the input:   1 2 4 5 3 6   The pairs (4,3), (5,3) form disordered pairs. Thus the disorderliness index of this array is 2.   As the criteria for determining the disorderliness is complex, the BHMC has requested your help to automate the process. You need to write an efficient program that calculates the disorderliness index of a street.   Input Line 1: N – The size of the array. 1 <= N <= 10^5 Line 2: N integers denoting the heights of the various buildings in order of their locations on the street.   Output Line 1: The disorderliness index of the street.  Example  Input: 6 1 2 4 5 3 6   Output: 2 
In the hidden country of Lapatrecta, an age old custom was followed to ensure that no outsider ever entered their country undetected. The security measure, though simple, was an effective one. Every person born in Lapatrecta had the initials of all his forefathers included in front of his name. Every once in a while, certain families became very famous and the initials of their ancestors were dropped from the names of all their descendants. Thus, there existed a nice homogeneity in the names of the people of Lapatrecta.  Now, a royal ball was organized at the behest of the Queen of Lapatrecta and all citizens were cordially invited to the event. The ball was being held to chop off the initials of the ancestors of the  most distinguished family of the country. The Queen set the following 2 criteria for determining the most distinguished family from amongst the invitees:   1.	The family must have more than 1 member living. 2.	The length of the ancestor list of the family must be as long as possible.   For example:   For 3 people: APJQ Ravi APJRS Rahul PJQ Bharat   The following observations hold: APJQ Ravi was of the same family as APJ Rahul but PJQ Bharat was not of the same family.   The length of the ancestor list for Ravi and Rahul was 3 whereas Bharat has an ancestor length of 0 as there is no other member of his family living.  However, if there existed a person named PJ Varun, Bharat and Varun would both have an ancestor list length of 2.   As a member of the Royal Court of Lapatrecta, you have been entrusted the task of determining the length of the ancestor list that will be chopped off by the Queen. You will be provided data in the following format:   Input Line 1: N – The number of people coming to the ball Line 2-N+1: The initials list of all the people coming to the ball. No initials list is longer than 100 characters.   Output Line 1: The length of the longest ancestor list.  Example  Input: 3 APJQ APJRS PJQ  Output: 3  
The planet of XANDOR was famous in the intergalactic empire for being home to the Carden - a race of super-intelligent computer scientists that were held in high regard for their achievements in the Intergalactic Mind Game Olympiads. The Carden decided to build a huge computer to answer questions related to Life, the Universe and Everything. They decided to use only their best two-input, noise immune, Boolean gates for this device - AND, OR and XOR. After a lot of minimization, they arrived at a variable assignment for their gates. Just then, lightning struck and erased all the parentheses from their expression. Not willing to spend the trouble parenthesizing the huge expression again, they outsourced the work to Earth.  As a consultant to XANDOR, you need to create a computer program that parenthesizes the Boolean expression in such a manner that the expression results in a true value and report the number of ways possible to do it. In case it is not possible to do so, you need to return 0.   Input An unparenthesized Boolean expression containing literals T and F which are connected via gates represented as . (dot) for an AND gate, + (plus) for an OR gate and * (star) for an XOR gate. There will be at least one literal in input line. Maximum number of literals i.e. T or F will be 15.  Output Line 1: A single value C >= 0 representing the number of true parenthesizations possible.  Example  Input: T.F+T*F  Output: 5    Description The 5 values correspond to the parenthesizations (((T.F)+T)*F), ((T.F)+(T*F)), ((T.(F+T))*F, (T.((F+T)*F)), (T.(F+(T*F))) - all of which evaluate to true. 
Modern cryptosystems rely heavily on our inability to factor large integers quickly as the basis for their security. They need a quick and easy way to generate and test for primes. Very often, the primes generated are very large numbers. You need to implement ways to test the primality of very large numbers.  Input Line 1: A number (no more than 1000 digits long)  Output Line 1: PRIME or COMPOSITE  Example  Input: 2760727302517  Output: PRIME 
 Given a matrix of dimensions RxC composed of only two types of characters: '*' and '#'  find the number of I characters present in the matrix. The criteria for identifying an I is as follows:    All the characters forming the I are # only.   The figure is completely filled with #s.   The thickness and width of the top and bottom rectangles is identical.   The central column is formed by leaving out floor(width/3) positions on both sides.   The central column may be of any length ≥ 1   The I must be surrounded by "*" or the border (i.e. no additional attachments to the I)    Note: A given input figure is likely to contain multiple I's.   Input Format:  Line 1: R C - Two space separated natural numbers denoting the dimensions of the rows and columns in the matrix respectively. Both R and C will be less than or equal to 40.  Line 2 to R+1: Lines containing C space separated symbols. The symbols are chosen from the set {*, #}   Output Format:  Line 1: The number of I's in the given figure.   Sample Input:  10 10 # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # * * * # # # # * * * * * * # # # # * * * * * * # # # # * * * * * * # * # # # * * * * * # # # # * * * * * * # # # # * * * # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #   Sample Output:  0   Explanation: The given I is invalid because of 2 reasons:  It is not completely filled  It has an extra attachment of a # on the right side of the central column.   
A set of N dignitaries have arrived in close succession at Delhi and are awaiting transportation to Roorkee to participate in the inaugural ceremony of Cognizance. Being big sponsors of Cognizance, it has been deemed unsuitable by the organizing team to arrange for more than one dignitary to travel in a single vehicle. In addition, each dignitary has specified his preferred modes of transport to the organizing team well in advance. Consequently, the organizing team has drawn up a list specifying the set of acceptable transport mechanisms for each dignitary. Given such a list of preferences and the list of N available vehicles at Delhi, you need to specify if an allocation of vehicles can be so made that everyone’s preferences are satisfied. Each dignitary takes up atmost 1 transportation unit. Input Format: Line 1: N  - The number of dignitaries. 1 ≤ N ≤ 100 Line 2-N+1: The names of the dignitaries – 1 per line. Line N+2 to 2*N+1: The names of the vehicles, 1 per line Line N+2 onwards: K – The size of the preference list for each dignitary, followed by K space separated names of acceptable transport means. K ≤ N  Note: None of the names will have a length > 100.  Output Format:   Line 1: Yes/No.  Sample Input:  4 Divye Rohit Akshat Parth Scorpio BMW Ford Chevrolet 1 BMW 1 Ford 2 Scorpio Chevrolet 1 Ford   Sample Output:  No  
 Its time of Raksha Bandhan so its compulsory for every brother to give a gift to his sister. Brother Jon is planning to give a string S of length L to his sister Arya. After receiving the gift from her brother, Arya decided to share the string with her brother Jon. String S contains characters from index 0 to index L - 1. She will select a pivot called P ie any index P(1 ≤ P ≤ L - 1) and divides the original string into two parts. First part will contain characters from index 0 to index P - 1 and second part will contain characters from index P to L - 1. Jon will keep the first part and Arya will keep the second part. Arya is great fan of LCP (Longest Common Prefix) so she decided that she will select such an index as pivot such that LCP of the two part is high. Though she like LCP but she does not know how to calculate it. Help her to solve the problem. Arya will ask you Q questions. Each question is represented by a index P and you have to answer the LCP (Longest Common Prefix) of the two parts.  Input  First line of input contains a string S.  Second line of input contains a positive number Q representing the number of question Arya will ask you.  Q lines will follow each containing a positive number P  Output  Output Q numbers(the required answer). Each number on a separate line.  Constraints  1 ≤ Length of the string(or L)  ≤ 5 * 10^6  1 ≤ P ≤ L - 1  1 ≤ Q(number of queries) ≤ 10^6   All characters in the string will be small case english alphabets (a-z)    NOTE: C++ users, please do not use cin and cout as test cases are huge, prefer scanf and printf    Example Input: abababa 4 1 2 3 6   Output: 0 2 0 1   Explanation  For the first query, first part is a.and second part is bababa, hence LCP is 0. For the second query, first part is ab.and second part is ababa, hence LCP is 2. For the third query, first part is aba.and second part is baba, hence LCP is 0. For the fourth query, first part is ababab.and second part is a, hence LCP is 1. 
 Lanku lives in a mysterious country having N cities. In his country instead of one capital, any number of cities can be capital. There are many cities in his country, but only the capital cities have all the facilities like hospitals, markets etc. So in order to get anything you have to visit the capital city. In order to simplify it, every city has been assigned to exactly one capital city. Apart from this, every capital city has an entry fee which means that whenever a person from another city enters its assigned capital city, he has to pay some entry fee.  Consider one unit cost is used to travel one unit distance.  You will be given the location of  N cities as N integers   x1 , x2  , x3 .... , xN. You will also be provided with a positive integer K  Now your objective is to choose  exactly K cities as capital and assign every city to exactly one capital city such that following function F is minimized: C[1] = cost to travel from 1^st city to its assigned capital city + fee to enter its assigned capital. C[2] = cost to travel from 2^nd city to its assigned capital city + fee to enter its assigned capital. ..... ..... C[N] = cost to travel from N^th city to its assigned capital city + fee to enter its assigned capital. F = C[1] + C[2] + .... C[N] NOTE: If the i^th city is capital city then C[i] = 0.  Output the minimum possible value of the function F.    Input   First line of input will contain number of test cases T.   First line of each test case will contain 2 integers N and K   Second line of each test case will contain N integers which are the positions of cities in  1-Dimensional co-ordinate system.   Third line of each test case will contain N  integers which are the entry fee of the i^th city.      Output   Output will contain T lines, one for each test case.   Each line will contain one Integer which is the minimum possible value of the function F.      Constraints   1 ≤ T ≤ 10   1 ≤ N ≤ 200   1 ≤ K ≤ 35   K ≤ N   1 ≤ Entry fee, Position of cities ≤ 10^5      Example  Input 1 7 3 9 50 20 39 25 41 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7  Output: 31    Explanation  In this scenario minimum possible value of F can be obtained by: We will make city 1, 3, 4 as the capitals. Capital at city 1 will be assigned to city 1 and 7. Capital at city 3 will be assigned to city 3 and 5. Capital at city 4 will be assigned to city 2, 4 and 6. C[1] = 0 C[2] = 11 + 4 = 15 C[3] = 0 C[4] = 0 C[5] = 5 + 3 = 8 C[6] = 2 + 4 = 6 C[7] = 1 + 1 = 2  
Mikahs is fond of mathematics and his favourite topic is Sets. He boasts of his knowledge in this topic and Ramu the mathematician is jealous of Mikahs. To take him down, Ramu prepares a tough challenge for Mikahs. He first describes a new quantity for numbers discovered by him. For a number X, the product of prime divisors of X is defined as the Niceness value of X by Ramu.  For Eg. X = 36, 36 = 2^2 * 3^2 therefore Niceness value of 36 is 2*3 = 6.  Now comes his question, an array of size N is given, and 3 integers K, A and B are given. Mikahs is asked to find the number of subsets of size atmost K whose Niceness value is in the range [A, B], where Niceness value of a subset is equal to the sum of Niceness values of its elements. NOTE: Two subsets are different when they contain at least one pair of elements A[i] (in first subset), A[j] (in second subset) where i != j. For eg. For array {2, 3, 2, 4}, subsets {A[0], A[1]} and {A[1], A[2]} are different.     Input First line of the input contains N, K, A, B which are length of array, maximum size of subset required, and the lower and upper bound of the range respectively. Second line contains N space separated integers, the array elements.  Output Print the number of subsets of size at most K whose Niceness value is in the range [A, B].  Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 32 1 ≤ K ≤ N 2 ≤ A < B ≤ 10^8 Array elements are in the range [2, 10^6]     Example Input: 4 2 3 6 5 2 3 4  Output: 5    Explanation The 5 subsets are : {5} - Niceness value 5 {3} - Niceness value 3 {2, 3} - Niceness value 2 + 3 = 5 {2, 4} - Niceness value 2 + 2 = 4 {3, 4} - Niceness value 3 + 2 = 5 Thus all subsets are of size atmost 2 and their niceness values are in the range [3, 6]. 
 Vishwas is suffering from sesquipedalophobia i.e. fear of long words. Vishwas cannot tolerate a string of length greater than K. So Dhruv gave him a long string (containing only characters a,b and c) of length N to annoy him. You being his friend, came to his rescue.You cannot change the length of the string. So you came up with a plan to change some of the characters of the string such that string repeats after every K characters. In other words, now he has to only memorize only first K characters and write them N / K times to form the whole string.   For example:- abcabcabc is  acceptable for K = 3.   As changing characters is a costly process, so you have to complete the process in minimum number of changes.Now you have to output the first K characters of these newly formed repetitive string. If there are multiple answer print the lexicographically smallest string.   Input   The first line of the input contains a pair of integers N, K. N is always divisible by K   The second line contains the string containing only characters a,b and c.    Output   Print the first K characters which can be formed in minimum number of changes.Also the output should be lexicographically smallest.    Constraints  1 ≤ K,N ≤ 10^6   Example Input: Input #1: 9 3 abccbcabc  Input #2: 4 2 bacb  Output: Output #1: abc  Ouput #2: ba     Explanation  In the first case,we can make the string repetitive after K characters by making 1 change. Change the 4th character to 'a'. Hence the output is abc. Other option is to output cbc but it requires 2 changes.  
 There are N teams who are solving a problem of Insomnia 2015 Qualifier. Every team has submitted a solution and got AC :) There are two things associated with each team, score S which they have got for successfully solving the problem, and a bonus M which is a score multiplier. You are given S and M for each team i. The net score of i^th team is Si * Mi for 1 ≤ i ≤ N . You have been asked Q queries. In each query you are given a number K and you have to tell which team is on the K^th position in the rank list. The rank list holds the net score and the team number i (1 based index) and is sorted in non increasing order. If the score of any two teams is the same then the team having lesser i value is kept above in the rank list.   Input  First line of the input contains an integer N denoting number of teams. Then follow N lines, each line contains two integers S denoting the score of team i and M denoting the multiplier value of team i separated by a space. Next line contains an integer Q denoting number of queries. Then follow Q lines, each line contains a single integer K which denotes the queried rank number.   Output  For each query output a single integer containing the team number which is on K^th rank.   Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 10^4 1 ≤ S ≤ 10^6 1 ≤ M ≤ 10^6 1 ≤ Q ≤ 10^4 1 ≤ K ≤ N i has 1 based indexing   Example Input 1: 5 4 6 1 2 3 4 8 10 4 3 5 1 2 3 4 5  Output 1: 4 1 3 5 2   Input 2: 4 6 6 12 3 3 12 4 9 3 1 2 3  Output 2: 1 2 3    Explanation Example case 1.The score of 5 teams are 24 (4 * 6), 2 (1 * 2), 12(3 * 4), 80 (8 * 10) and 12 (4 * 3) respectively. So the rank list will look like Score   Team 80          4 24          1 12          3 12          5 2            2 Although two teams having number 3 and 5 have the same net score, but team having number 3 is put above than team having number 5 in the rank list as per the sorting policy. Example case 1. As the score of all the teams are same, i.e. 36 so the rank list will contain the team number in order 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 
Cars of future no longer need fuel to run, but they are fitted with special engines which can only operate in one of the two modes at a time ,either go up the road, or go down the road.  There are N towns in country. i^th town is at height H[i] (1 ≤ i ≤ N) above the sea level.  Changing mode of the car requires permissions from mayor of the town you are currently at. Mayor of i^th town charges amount C[i] (1 ≤ i ≤ n) for giving permission to change mode of the car.  These N towns are connected by R bidirectional roads. Initially no mode is set, so you need permissions to set a mode.  You have to travel from town 1 to N, in minimum amount of cost. Print minimum money required to make the travel. If it is impossible print -1.  Note:   Go up the road mode: when you are at town A and want to go to town B, where H[A] <= H[B] Go down the road mode: when you are at town A and want to go to town B, where H[A] ≥ H[B] If you continue with the same mode, you do not need to take permissions from mayor.     Input  First line contains two space separated integer N and R, number of towns and number of roads. Next line contains N space separated integer where i^th integer is H[i], height of i^th town. Next line contains N space separated integer where i^th integer is C[i], cost charged by mayor of i^th town to give permission for changing the mode. Next R lines contains two space separated integer u and v, specifying there is a bidirectional road between town u and v.     Output Print minimum cost required for travel. If it is impossible print -1.  Constraints  2 ≤ N ≤ 100000 1 ≤ R ≤ 500000 1 ≤ H[i] ≤ 10^9 1 ≤ C[i] ≤ 10^9     Example Input: 6 6 10 5 7 15 20 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 3 3 6 1 4 4 5 5 6  Output: 2    Explanation There are two paths from 1 - 6 P1: (1, 2, 3, 6) You need to pay $1 to mayor of town 1 to chose down mode. (H[1] ≥ H[2]) You need to pay $1 to mayor of town 2 to chose up mode. (H[2] <= H[3]) You need to pay $1 to mayor of town 3 to chose down mode. (H[3] ≥ H[6]) Total cost = $3 P2: (1, 4, 5, 6) You need to pay $1 to mayor of town 1 to chose up mode. (H[1] <= H[4]) You continue with the previous up mode. (H[4] <= H[5]) You need to pay $1 to mayor of town 5 to chose down mode. (H[5] ≥ H[6]) Total cost = $2 So minimum money required is $2. 
Mr. Napa, the terrorist, came to MNNIT and has attacked the Lecture Hall. He has a freeze gun and has frozen everyone there. Dassu, the super-human , came to their rescue. Dassu destroyed the freeze gun and ruined NAPA's plan. But Dassu is unable to revert people back to normal. There are 2 red buttons on the top-right block (1, M) . One is to convert all the people on that block back to normal, other is to kill all the people on that block. But the thing is only one button can be pressed and that too once. Dassu wants to save all the people and NAPA wants to kill all of them. Since no one can achieve their goal individually, so NAPA proposed an agreement. He said that both of them want everyone to be present in the top-right block. So they should begin by pushing people towards that block. The one who pushed the last person would press his/her desired button. Now the Lecture hall is rectangular and divided in blocks. There are N rows( 1 , 2 .. , N ) and M columns ( 1, 2 .. , M ). There are P people in the Hall. Now Dassu and Mr. NAPA would play turn  by turn and could select any block( with atleast one person )  and push some people(any positive number) from that block to the block up or right(but not both) of it. Now Dassu wants to know whether to play the game or not. Dassu will move first and will only play the game if Dassu can save everyone. Both Dassu and Mr. NAPA are nerds, so they will make the best possible moves.    NOTE: There may be multiple people on a single block at a time  Input The First line would contain 3 integers - N, M & P The next P lines would contain 2 integers each, the row and column number of each person.     Output "Yes" if DASSU can win the game, and "No" otherwise.     Constraints Should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have. Format it like:  1 ≤ N * M ≤ 10^18 1 ≤ N,M 1 ≤ P ≤ 10^6 1 ≤ X ≤ N 1 ≤ Y ≤ M     Example Input: 3 3 1 2 2  Output: No    Explanation The person is at (2, 2).  Possible ways to reach (1, 3):- (2, 2) -> (2, 3) -> (1, 3) (2, 2) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 3) In both the case, NAPA is making the last move. ... 
There exist a 2-Dimensional rectangular field of  infinite length and breadth. N Iron Blocks are dropped onto this field from the sky at particular coordinates. However, it is made sure that only one block is dropped at a particular coordinate. You are standing at a particular location (X, Y) of the field. You have a magnet with a power M in your hand.

Sheldon replied, "ok then lets have a bet if you give me a better code than this i will buy you the latest edition of batman action figure, otherwise you will have to give me your collection of superhero figures". Leonard is sure that this code will take lots of time in generating the output, but doesn't know how to make an optimal code. so please help Leonard by making a better code.  Input First line contains the no of test cases 'T'. Then 'T' lines follow each containing two integer 'number' and 'count'.

Sruthi is looking at a spreadsheet containing N rows. Only K rows of the spreadsheet are visible at a time (If the top row is i, the bottom row will be i+K-1). In the beginning, rows 1..K are visible. Sruthi needs to read certain values from rows r1,r2...rM in that order. It is possible to scroll the spreadsheet so that the rows j..j+K-1 can be viewed instead of the current i..i+K-1. This operation counts as one scroll and its scroll length is defined as |j-i|  Find the minimum number of scrolls required so that Sruthi can read of all the M values in the given order. As there may be more than one way to do this, also find the minimum total scroll length required to do the reading in so many scrolls.   Input The first line of the input contains the integer T ( ≤ 20), the number of test cases to follow.  The description of each test case begins with a line containing 3 integers N( ≤ 10^8), K( ≤ 10^8) and M( ≤ 50000) as defined in the problem. Following this are M lines giving the row numbers from which values have to be read sequentially.   Output Output two space separated integers in a line per test case : The minimum number of scrolls required and the minimum scroll length required for the minimum number of scrolls.

In Dystopia, chocolates are being distributed to children waiting in a queue. The distribution proceeds as follows. Each chocolate bar is rectangular in shape with integer edge lengths. If the chocolate bar is a square, it is given away completely to the first child in the queue. Otherwise the largest possible square piece of chocolate is broken off from the chocolate bar and given to the first child. After a child receives his share of chocolate, he leaves the queue. The remaining portion of the chocolate bar is dealt with in the same fashion and the whole or a portion of it is given to the next child in the queue.  For example, if we start with a 5x3 chocolate bar, the first child in the queue receives a 3x3 chocolate bar, leaving a 2x3 bar. The second child gets a 2x2 bar while the third and fourth children get 1x1 bars. Thus four children have been fed using the 5x3 bar.  The Dystopian government has got a carton of chocolate bars to be distributed to children in the country. To make sure that maximum inequality is achieved while distributing chocolates, the chocolate bars in the carton are all of different sizes. For every i such that M ≤ i ≤ N and every j such that P ≤ j ≤ Q (where M,N,P,Q are integers) there is exactly one chocolate bar of length i and breadth j in the carton. Here a bar of length i and breadth j is considered to be different from a bar of length j and breadth i.  Given the values of M,N,P,Q find the number of children that can be fed with the chocolate in the carton.   Input The first line of the input contains the number of test cases, T ( ≤ 1000) Following this are T lines, each describing a test case with four integers M,N,P,Q separated by spaces (1 ≤ M ≤ N ≤ 100000000, 1 ≤ P ≤ Q ≤ 1000)   Output Output T lines, each containing an integer : The number of children that can be fed using the chocolate in the carton   Example  Input: 2 1 2 1 2 3 4 4 5  Output: 6 14  
Consider three distinct points A,B,C on a plane. The sum of straight line distances from A to B and B to C is always greater than or equal to the straight line distance from A to C. Equality holds only when ABC is a degenerate triangle. This is the famous triangle inequality In this case, distance between points is measured by the Euclidean metric. ie, the distance between points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) is given by sqrt((x1-x2)^2+(y1-y2)^2). However, this is not the only metric possible. Another common metric used is the Manhattan metric where the distance between the pair of points is given by |x1-x2|+|y1-y2|  You are given N distinct points on a plane where distances are measured using the Manhattan metric. Find the number of ordered triplets of distinct points (A,B,C) such that the sum of distances from A to B and B to C is equal to the distance from A to C.   Input The first line of input contains an integer T ( ≤ 10), the number of test cases to follow. Following this are the descriptions of T test cases. Each test case description begins with an integer N ( ≤ 50000), the number of points. Following this are N lines, each giving the x and y coordinates of a point (0 ≤ xi,yi ≤ 10^8) separated by a space.   Output Output T lines, each containing the number of ordered triplets of distinct points in every test case with the given property   Example  Input: 2 3 0 0 1 1 2 2 3 0 0 1 2 2 1  Output: 2 0  
Dystopia consists of N cities. There are one-way roads connecting some pairs of cities. The dysfunctional state has recently seen a lot of protests to overthrow the tyrannical ruler and the government plans to use military patrol vehicles to make sure that the protests are suppressed. Every patrol vehicle is assigned a sequence of cities. If a patrol vehicle is assigned the cities c1,c2,...ck then it starts from the city c1 and takes the direct one-way road to c2, from there it takes the one-way road to c3 and so on. Finally the vehicle takes the one way road from ck to c1. This routine is repeated everyday to keep the protestors perpetually under fear.  Now note that:  Every city has to appear in exactly one vehicle's patrol sequence exactly once  Every patrol vehicle has to move - so it has to be assigned more than one city   The government does not have any limit on the number of patrol vehicles it can use. However, they want to make sure that the least possible amount of money is spent on the patrol mission and hence they want to minimise the total distance travelled by the patrol vehicles.  Given the road network of Dystopia, find the minimum total distance the patrol vehicles need to move so that all the cities can be patrolled. If it is impossible to organise a nationwide patrol with the given constraints, report the same.   Input First line of the contains T, the number of test cases (T ≤ 10) This is followed by the descriptions of the T testcases. The first line of the description contains two integers N and R, the number of cities and one way roads respectively (N ≤ 200,R ≤ 10000). The cities are numbered 1,2,3,...N This is followed by R lines, each representing a one way road by 3 integers N1, N2 and D : the start city, the end city and the length of the road respectively ( N1!=N2, 1 ≤ D ≤ 1000000). You are assured that there is no more than one one way road from any N1 to N2  Output For each test case output one line. If the patrol can be done, output the minimum total distance that the patrol vehicles have to travel. Otherwise output Impossible   Example  Input: 2 3 3 1 2 1 2 3 1 1 3 1 4 6 1 2 2 2 3 2 3 4 2 4 1 2 1 4 1 3 2 1  Output: Impossible 6  
Phileas Fogg and Passepartout are now going on a road trip in their brand new car. They start at location A0 and need to go to AN. Their car has a capacity to hold only C units of fuel and can travel unit distance on unit amount of fuel. They start by filling some amount of fuel from the filling station at A0. On the way, there are several filling stations A1, A2,... AN-1. The cost of fuel is not the same at all filling stations. Find the minimum amount that they have to spend on fuel to make the journey.  Note that it is assured that the journey can be completed with the car of the given capacity.   Input The first line of input contains T (≤10), the number of test cases. Following this are the descriptions of the testcases The first line in the description of each test case contains two space integers N (≤50000) and C (≤10^8). This is followed by N lines, each containing an integer. The integer on the ith line is the distance from A0 to Ai and is ≤ 10^8. The distances are in increasing order. This is followed by N more lines, each containing an integer. The integer on the ith line is the cost of one unit of fuel at the filling station Ai-1 and is  ≤ 10^8.   Output Output one integer per test case, the minimum total amount that needs to be spent on fuel to complete the journey   Example  Input: 2 5 10 10 20 30 40 50 1 2 1 2 1 5 15 10 20 30 40 50 1 2 1 2 1  Output: 70 60 
Unlike Dystopia, the neighbouring nation of Utopia believes in economic development. To improve the economy of the nation, the Utopian government has decided to select some pairs of cities as sister cities and take steps to improve trade relations between each pair.  There are N cities in Utopia, numbered 1 to N. There are two-way roads  connecting some pairs of cities. The total number of roads in Utopia is R. Now the road network in Utopia has been created efficiently so that there is no road that is redundant. That is, there is exactly one way to travel between any pair of cities without using the same road twice. Now when a pair of cities is chosen as sister cities, the government wants to make sure that there is a direct road between them. Also, a given city cannot have more than one sister.  Given the road network of Utopia, find the number of ways of selecting K pairs of sister cities under these constraints. As the answer can be quite large, output it modulo 100000007.  For example, assume that there are 6 cities in Utopia. There are direct roads between the following pairs of cities : (1,2), (2,3), (2,4), (4,5), (4,6). Notice that  there is exactly one way to travel between any pair of cities. If the government wants to select two pairs of sister cities, it can do it in four ways : {(1,2),(4,5)}, {(3,2),(4,5)}, {(1,2),(4,6)}, {(3,2),(4,6)}   Input First line of the input contains T (≤10), the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test cases. The description of each test case begins with a line containing 3 space separated integers N (<400), R (<10000) and K (<400). Following these are R lines, each representing a road in Utopia. The line will contain two different space separated integers N1 and N2 implying that there is a two way road between N1 and N2. You are assured that the road network has the property as described in the problem statement.   Output For each test case, output modulo 100000007 the number of ways of selecting K pairs of sister cities satisfying the conditions in the problem statement.   Example  Input: 2 3 2 1 1 2 2 3 6 5 2 1 2 2 3 2 4 4 5 4 6  Output: 2 4 
A skier wants to ski down from the top of a mountain to its base. There are several possible routes, using different slopes enroute, and passing through some flat areas. The effort expended in skiing down a slope depends upon the length of the slope and the speed of skiing. For each slope, there is a maximum advisable speed. The skier wants to use a toute that minimizrs the average effort spent per unit distance traveled (i.e. the total effort expended divided by the total distance traveled).  The flat regions on the mountain are numbered 1 to N from top to bottom. The skier begins at level 1 and needs to reach level N. You are given the numbers of the flat regions each slope connects. Note that on a slope, one can only ski downwards. For each slope, you are also given the length of the slope and the maximum advisable speed for it. The effort expended in skiing down a particular slope is given by the following formula:  e = d*(70-s) if s ≤ 60, and e = d*(s-50) if s > 60  where e is the effort required, d is the distance traveled and s is the speed of travel.  You have to determine the minimum average effort per unit distance that the skier has to expend in order to reach the mountain base, while staying within the maximum advisable speed at every slope.   Input The first line of input gives the number of test cases T(≤20). This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases For each test case, the first line of input gives the number of flats, N (N ≤ 1000), and the number of slopes, R (R ≤ 20000), connecting them respectively. Each of the next R lines describes a slope by giving: the numbers of the flats at the top and the bottom of the slope, the maximum advisable speed for the slope (≤ 100), and the length of the slope (≤ 1000) respectively.   Output For each test case, output a single number (with four places after the decimal point, rounded up) that gives the minimum average effort per unit distance that needs to be expended to ski down from the mountain top to the base. The output for each test case should be on a separate line.   Example  Input: 2 4 5 1 4 30 60 1 2 50 40 1 3 60 20 2 4 60 50 3 4 50 50 3 3 1 2 50 40 1 3 40 20 2 3 20 30  Output: 14.4445 30.0000 
Place-name game is a favourite pastime among the few children that go to school in Dystopia. The game is played as follows : One player says the name of a city and the next player has to say the name of a city that begins with the last letter of the said city. The game then goes on.  Dystopian cities recently went through a massive renaming. Now each city has a name that begins with a consonant and ends with a consonant.  Anaximander is a student with a very poor knowledge of geography. Hence he fares very poorly in the game. He has recently come up with a new idea. He would just remember the name of 21 Dystopian cities. He wants to choose the 21 cities such that there is exactly one city name starting with each consonant and exactly one city name ending with each. This would give him a good advantage in the game, whether he is playing first or second.  Given the names of the N cities in Dystopia, find out the number of ways Anaximander can select 21 city names out of the lot satisfying the properties. As this number can be very large, output it modulo 100000007.   Input The first line of the input contains N (≤1000), the number of cities. This is followed by N lines, each containing the name of a city in Dystopia. Each city name will begin and end with a consonant, and will contain at least 2 and at most 10 letters.   Output Output modulo 100000007 the number of ways Anaximander can choose 21 city names out of the N with the intended properties.   Example  Input: 23 BBBB CCCC DDDD FFFF GGGG HHHH JJJJ KKKK LLLL MMMM NNNN PPPP QQQQ RRRR SSSS TTTT VVVV WWWW XXXX YYYY ZZZZ BAAC CAAB  Output: 2 
It is after years that Dystopian Institute of Technology has got funds for upgrading their computers. However, the people in charge of the upgrade have decided to make this a chance to fill their own pockets rather. There are N computers in the DIT network, numbered 0 to N-1. Computer 0 is the main server which connects the network to the outer world. Some pairs of the computers are directly connected in the network. For other pair of computers to communicate with each other, they have to do it via some other computer. For example, if there are only 3 computers in the network and the only direct connections are 0-1 and 0-2, then 1 communicates with 2 using 0 as intermediate. There is no limit on the number of intermediate computers to be used for communication between a pair. Now, since the DIT network was built on the principle of minimum expenditure, the N computers have been made pairwise connected by using the minimum number of direct connections - ie, N-1. The upgrade contractor has decided to not do the work properly but pocket the entire funds instead. However, to show that he has done something, he will rearrange the computers. For example he could move the computer number 3 to where 2 was earlier, 2 to 1, 1 to 3, 4 to 5 and 5 to 4. The computer number 0 is special and cannot be moved. Direct connections between computers depend on the locations though. Hence if there was a direct connection earlier between 3 and 5, it will now be between 1 and 4 (since they have been placed at the locations 3 and 5 were at earlier). However, he has noticed something strange : the new direct connection between computers i and j works if and only if there was a direct connection between i and j earlier. Hence he wants to rearrange the computers in such a way that the pairs of computers which are connected directly now are the same pairs which were connected earlier. Given the computer network, count the number of ways the computers can be rearranged satisfying the conditions.  Input The first line of the input contains T, the number of test cases (T ≤ 10). Following this are the descriptions of the test cases. Each description starts with a line containing the integer N, the number of computers in the network (1 ≤ N ≤ 10000). This is followed by N-1 lines, each containing a pair of integers i and j, denoting that computer i is directly connected to computer j. It is assured that these N-1 direct connections will make every pair of computers connected (via intermediates if needed).  Output For each test case, output the number of rearrangements of the computers. A rearrangement (p0,p1,p2...pN-1) of (0,1,2...N-1) is valid if the following conditions are satisfied:  p0 If there is a direct connection between i and j, there should also be a direct connection between pi and pj  Notice that (0,1,2...N-1) is considered a valid rearrangement of itself. Also, since the answer could be very big, output it modulo 1000000007  Example  Input: 1 6 0 1 0 2 0 3 3 4 3 5  Output: 4 
The Rubik's cube is perhaps the world's most popular intellectual toy. More than just the joy of solving, there is a lot of mathematics to it too. Consider a solved Rubik's cube. The six faces of the cube are named FRONT, BACK, UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT respectively. An elementary move of the Rubik's cube is rotating a face by 90 degrees clockwise, 90 degrees anticlockwise or 180 degrees about an axis from the centre of the face to the centre of the cube. Any valid state of the Rubik's cube can be reached by applying these elementary operations one after the other. An elementary move is denoted in the following fashion. If a given face is rotated by 90 degrees clockwise about the axis passing from the centre of the face to the centre of the cube, the move is denoted by the first letter of the name of the face. If the rotation is anticlockwise by 90 degrees, the letter is followed by an apostrophe ('). If the rotation is by 180 degrees, the letter is followed by a 2. For example, a 90 degree clockwise rotation of the right face is denoted by R, a 90 degree anticlockwise rotation of the back face by B' and a 180 degree rotation of the top face by U2. The elementary moves are explained with the help of animations in the "Face turns" section of this page. The elementary moves can be combined to get a compound move of the cube. For example, URF2 denotes rotating the top face by 90 degrees clockwise, then the right face by 90 degrees clockwise followed by the front face by 180 degrees. In this problem you will be given a string describing a sequence of elementary moves on a solved Rubik's cube. Your task is to find out the number of times the sequence should be applied repeatedly to the cube to get back the original cube.  Input The first line of input gives T, the number of test cases (1≤T≤1000). Following this are T lines, each containing a string denoting a sequence of moves on the Rubik's cube. The string will contain only the characters U, D, L, R, F, B, ' and 2, and will be at most 1000 characters long. It is assured to be a valid sequence of elementary moves.  Output For each test case, output the minimum number of times (≥1) the move sequence must be applied to a solved Rubik's cube to get back the solved cube again.   Example  Input: 4 R RR2 RU R2R'R'  Output: 4 4 105 1 
You are given the coordinates of the vertices of a square in the 2-d plane. All vertex coordinates will be integers. Now consider all convex quadrilaterals which also have integer coordinates for their vertices such that the midpoints of their edges are the vertices of the original square. Find the sum of areas of all such quadrilaterals.  Input The first line of input gives T, the number of test cases (1≤T≤25000). Following this are the descriptions of the individual testcases. Each testcase consists of four lines, each line containing two space separated integers - the x and y coordinates of a distinct vertex of the square. The coordinate limits are -1000000000≤xi,yi≤1000000000. It is assured that the four vertices will correspond to a square.  Output For each testcase output the total area of quadrilaterals with the given property. Since the answer could be very large, give the answer modulo 100000007.   Example  Input: 2 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 -1 -1 0  Output: 0 4 
You must be familiar with the use of numeric keys to enter alphabets in mobile phones. A single numeric key when pressed gives a character. When pressed again, it changes to another and so on. Once the set of characters mapped to the key is exhausted, the key wraps around to the original character. The key mapping in this problem is the T9 mapping, restricted to lowercase english characters. The characters corresponding to the individual keys are:   2: a,b,c  3: d,e,f  4: g,h,i  5: j,k,l  6: m,n,o  7: p,q,r,s  8: t,u,v  9: w,x,y,z  For example, if you press the key 2 once, it prints the character 'a'. On pressing it again, it becomes 'b', then 'c', then back to 'a' and so on. Consider a string made of lowercase letters only. To enter this string into a mobile phone, a certain key sequence has to be entered with sufficient gaps in between. Suppose that the key sequence entered is correct but the gaps between keypresses are made arbitrarily. This can result in very different strings being printed. For example, let the string to be input be "mod". The key sequence corresponding to this is 6_6663 where '_' denotes a gap between the keypresses. Suppose the keys are pressed in the same order, but with gaps between keypresses arbitrary. This can result in 8 different strings: "mod", "nnd", "omd", "mmmmd", "mnmd", "mmnd", "nmmd" and "md". Given an input string, Find the number of possible strings printed by the key sequence corresponding to it.  Input The first line of the input consists of T, the number of testcases (1≤T≤10). Following this are T lines, each containing a string. The string will consist only of lowercase letters and will have a maximum length of 100000   Output For each string, output the number of strings corresponding to its key sequence. Since the answer can be very big, output it modulo 100000007   Example  Input: 2 mod iopc  Output: 8 64 
A function f is defined over natural numbers as: f(N) = ∑ di μ(di) Here the summation is over di, all positive integers which are factors of N. μ(n) is the Möbius function defined in the following way: If there exists a prime p such that p^2 is a factor of n, then μ(n)=0. Otherwise, if n has an odd number of prime factors, μ(n)=-1. If not, μ(n)=1. Thus the first few values for μ(n) (starting from 1) are 1, -1, -1, 0, -1, 1, -1, 0... Given an integer X (0 ≤ X ≤ 10^12), find the smallest natural number N such that |f(N)|>X.  Input The first line of the input contains T, the number of test cases (T ≤ 1000). Following this are T lines, each containing an integer X (0 ≤ X ≤ 10^12) corresponding to the test case.  Output For each test case in the input, output the smallest natural number N such that  |f(N)|>X.  Example  Input: 2 1 2  Output: 3 5 
The latest attraction for Techkriti 2112 is is a huge display of genetically modified plants. The arrangement consists of a cuboidal box of size Nx × Ny × Nz made of unit cubes. Each unit cube is identified using (x,y,z) coordinates - x ranges from 0 to Nx-1 and so on - and contains a plant genetically modified to show fluorescence. The natural colour of the plants is green. However, on exposing a plant to laser light, it changes colour to red. What is more interesting is that on exposing a red plant to laser light again, it changes back to green and this continues.  The organisers have realised that they can use the display to make many coloured patterns. They have with them a laser light sheet which they can place along an axis and move in one direction, exposing many plants to light at once. For example, if the plane of the light sheet is kept as the y axis and it is moved from a to b, every plant with the y coordinate between a and b inclusive will turn from green to red or red to green. Every time the laser is operated, it is only the plants with one specific coordinate in a certain range which are affected. You are told that initially all plants were green. Given the sequence of exposing plants to laser light, your task is to find the number of red coloured plants in certain cuboidal subregions of the display  Input The first line of the input contains T, the number of test cases (T ≤ 10). Following this are the descriptions of the T test cases. The description of each test case starts with a line containing four space separated integers : Nx, Ny, Nz and Q (1 ≤ Nx,Ny,Nz ≤ 100000; Q ≤ 5000). The first three are the extents of the display in the three dimensions while Q is the number of queries which are to follow. Following this are Q lines, each describing a query. A query will be of one of the following forms :  0 i j : expose all plants with x coordinates i ≤ x ≤ j to laser light 1 i j : expose all plants with y coordinates i ≤ y ≤ j to laser light 2 i j : expose all plants with z coordinates i ≤ z ≤ j to laser light 3 x1 y1 z1 x2 y2 z2 : Report the number of red plants in the cuboidal region with (x1,y1,z1) and (x2,y2,z2) as diagonally opposite cells - ie, all red plants with x1 ≤ x ≤ x2, y1 ≤ y ≤ y2 and  z1 ≤ z ≤ z2 All individual coordinates will be valid - ie, every x coordinate will be such that 0 ≤ x ≤ Nx-1  and so on. Also, i ≤ j; x1 ≤ x2; y1 ≤ y2 and z1 ≤ z2  Output For every query of the form 3 x1 y1 z1 x2 y2 z2 in the input, output the number of red plants with coordinates constrained by x1 ≤ x ≤ x2, y1 ≤ y ≤ y2 and  z1 ≤ z ≤ z2  Example  Input: 1 3 4 5 5 0 1 2 1 2 3 3 0 0 0 1 2 3 2 3 4 3 1 1 1 2 2 2  Output: 12 4 
Given natural numbers N and Q, an N-vector is defined as the ordered N-tuplet of integers (x0, x1, x2 ..... xN-1) such that 0 ≤ xi < Q for all i. The parent of coordinate xi is defined as x(i-1) mod N and the child of xi is defined as x(i+1)mod N. The IOPC transformation converts and N-vector x into an N-vector y with the coordinates given by :   If parent(xi) ≤ child(xi) then yi = (parent(xi) + child(xi))/2  If parent(xi) > child(xi) then yi = (parent(xi) + child(xi) + Q)/2 mod Q  Note that the division above is integer division - fractions are always rounded down. As an example, let N=4, Q=5. Let the N-vector x be (2,0,3,1). Then the transformed N-vector y is (3,2,0,5). An N-vector x is said to be invariant under the IOPC transformation if the yii for all values of i. Given N and Q, find the number of invariant N-vectors.  Input The first line of the input contains T, the number of test cases (T ≤ 10000). Following this are T lines, each consisting of two space separated integers N and Q (1 ≤ N,Q ≤ 10^9).  Output For each test case, output the number of invariant N-vectors. Since the answer could be very large, output it modulo 100000007.  Example  Input: 3 2 7 4 5 6 3  Output: 7 5 6 
Terrorists from Dystopia had always been targeting Utopian civilians, but this is a new low that they have reached. A psychotic terrorist, disguised as a teacher, has taken some kindergarten students hostage. She first made every student write the names of the other students (s)he likes on a piece of paper and collected these "like lists". Now she plans to do the following: She will select a set of students at random from the lot. Then she will look at the "like lists" collected from the entire class. If a like list has the name of at least one selected student, it is considered a favourable like list. If the number of favourable like lists is greater than or equal to the number of students selected, she sends them back and picks another set of students. However, if the number of favourable like lists is less than the number of students selected, she plans to kill the selected students. You will be given the like lists of all the students. Your task is find out whether the class is safe or not. The class is said to be not safe if the terrorist can pick some set of students such that the total number of favourable like lists for them is less than the number of selected students, resulting in their execution.  Input The first line of the input contains T, the number of test cases (T ≤ 10). Following this are the descriptions of the test cases. The description of each test case begins with a line containing the integer N, the number of students held hostage (N ≤ 500). The students are numbered from 0 to N-1. Following this are N lines describing the N like lists : The first line after N describes the like list of student 0, the second line the like list of student 1 and so on. Each like list contains some space separated integers. The first integer is K, the number of students the student likes (0 ≤ K ≤ min(50,N-1)). Following this are the identities of the students (s)he likes. The identities of the students will be between 0 and N-1. You are assured that no number will appear more than once in the list, and that no student will have his own number in the list.  Output For each test case, output "safe" if all the children are safe and "not safe" otherwise, according to the definition in the problem statement (quotes for clarity).  Example  Input: 2 3 2 1 2 2 2 0 2 0 1 3 2 1 2 1 0 1 0  Output: safe not safe 
There is a new prodigy in town and he has challenged people to a game. They have to give him an integer N and he will immediately respond with a number which has more than N factors. What the prodigy really does is to do some complex calculations in his head to find out the smallest integer with more than N factors. However, he has a weakness - he knows to do those calculation only on numbers up to 10^19, so if the answer to be reported is more than 10^19, he will not be able to come up with his solution and will lose the game. Given the integer the people give to the prodigy, you need to report whether he wins the game or not. If he wins, also output his answer.  Input The first line of input contains T (T ≤ 25), the number of test cases. Following this are T lines, each containing an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10^9) - the number which is given to the prodigy.  Output Output one line per test case. If the smallest integer X with more than N factors is bigger than 10^19 so that the prodigy does not win, print "lose". Otherwise print "win X" (quotes for clarity).  Example  Input: 3 3 5 12345678  Output: win 6 win 12 lose  
The terrorist strike on the kindergarten was universally condemned. The Utopians' patience had worn thin and they decided to wipe out the entire Dystopian terrorist base. Utopian military plans to do this with a coordinated strike. They have N military bases distributed all over the world. They also know the locations of the M terrorist camps. They will choose M out of their N military bases as attack bases and each will send a missile to one terrorist camp, all at the same time. By this they hope that they can eliminate Dystopian terrorism completely without giving them a chance to retaliate. You are given the locations of the military bases and the terrorist camps. Given that all missiles have the same maximum range, your task is to find out the minimum value of the missile range so that such a coordinated attack is possible. Of course, the minimum distance between any pair of points in this case is the geodesic distance on the spherical planet.  Input The first line of the input contains T, the number of test cases (T ≤ 10). Following this are the descriptions of the T test cases. The description of each test case starts with a line containing 3 space separated integers N, M and R (1 ≤ M ≤ N ≤ 100; 1 ≤ R ≤ 10000). N and M are the number of military bases and terrorist camps respectively while R is the radius of the spherical planet. Following this are N lines containing the locations of the military bases - the locations are specified using two space separated numbers φ and λ, the latitude and longitude of the location on the planet in degrees. φ ranges from -90 to 90 while λ ranges from -180 to 180. Both numbers have 6 digits after the decimal point. Following these lines are M lines with the locations of the terrorist camps in the same fashion.  Output For each test case, output the minimum value of the missile range required so that the coordinated attack can be carried out. Format this number in the following fashion : #.######E*## - Here, # stands for a digit and * stands for a sign (+/-). The leading digit has to be non-zero.  Example  Input: 1 4 2 10 0.000000 0.000000 0.000000 90.000000 0.000000 180.000000 0.000000 -90.000000 90.000000 0.000000 -90.000000 0.000000  Output: 1.570796E+01 
In this problem you will be given a simple acyclic graph and asked to perform update or query operations on the graph. Update operations will involve adding an edge to the graph or removing one. You are assured that adding the given edges will not introduce cycles in the graph. Your task is to answer the queries which ask you to find the number of ways the graph can be coloured using K colours such that no two adjacent vertices have the same colour.  Input The first line of the input gives T, the number of test cases (T ≤ 100). Following this are the descriptions of the test cases. The description of each test case starts with a line containing three space separated integers N, M and Q (1 ≤ N ≤ 100, 0 ≤ M < N; Q ≤ 1000). N and M are the number of vertices and edges in the graph respectively (with numbering of vertices and edges starting from 0), while Q is the total number of update and query operations you will be asked to perform. Following this are M lines of the form i j, denoting that there is an edge between i and j. This is followed by Q lines, each of which will be in one of the three forms:   0 a b : Add an edge between the existing vertices a and b  1 a b : Remove the existing edge between the vertices a and b  K (K > 1) : Report the number of colourings of the graph with K colours such that no pair of adjacent vertices is coloured same  You are assured that the graph remains simple and acyclic at every stage.  Output For each query of type K (K > 1), output the number of ways the graph can be coloured validly using K colours. Since the answer could be very large, output it modulo 100000007.   Example  Input: 1 3 1 5 0 1 4 0 1 2 3 1 0 1 2  Output: 48 12 4 
The celebrities of Pretendia are just as snobbish as those anywhere else. If celebrity x admires celebrity y, Then y thinks too high of him/herself and does not admire x back. Also, if x admires y, x also admires everyone that y admires. All celebrities of Pretendia are going to be present at the premiere of Chapangg 2. True to their snobbish nature, the celebrities want to make sure that they do not wear dress made by the same designer who makes dress for someone who admires them. Given who admires whom in Pretendia, find out the minimum number of designers required to make dresses for all celebrities.  Input The first line of the input contains T, the number of test cases (T ≤ 10). Following this are the descriptions of the test cases. Each starts with two space separated integers N & M (1 ≤ N ≤ 1000;0 ≤ M ≤ 40000). N is the number of celebrities in Pretendia and celebrities are numbered from 0 to N-1. Following this are M lines of the form i j (0 ≤ i,j < N) and tells you that celebrity i admires celebrity j. Taken together, these M lines  will satisfy the conditions in the problem statement.  Output For each test case, output the minimum number of designers required so that every celebrity can wear a dress made by someone who does not design dresses for any of his admirers.  Example  Input: 1 5 6 0 2 1 2 2 3 0 3 1 4 2 4  Output: 3 
Dystopians have realised that corruption is the root cause for all their problems. They have decided to launch their mass protest against corruption by blocking one of the highways in the Dystopian capital. To make sure that the government notices their agitation, they want to make sure that the Prime Minister is also affected by the blocking. Their aim is to force the Prime Minister to choose an alternate route from the parliament to his house, which makes his journey longer All roads in the capital are two-way. The road network is such that no more than one road connects a pair of junctions directly. Also, every junction in the capital is connected to every other junction by some sequence of roads. Given the road map of the capital, find out the minimum distance the Prime minister has to travel to reach home from the parliament if the anti-corruption movement blocks one of the roads.  Input The first line of the Input contains T, the number of test cases (T ≤ 10). Following are the descriptions of the T test cases. Each starts with a line containing three space separated integers N, M and Q (1 ≤ N ≤ 1000; 1 ≤ M ≤ 20000; Q ≤ 10000). N is the number of junctions in the capital and are numbered from 0 to N-1 (0 is the location of the Parliament and N-1 is the location of the Prime Minister's home). M is the number of roads in the capital (numbered from 0 to M-1) and Q, the number of queries you have to answer. Following this are M lines, each containing three space separated integers i, j and d (0 ≤ i,j < N; 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5), denoting that there is a road between junctions i and j having distance d. Q lines follow this, describing the queries you need to answer. Each query will contain a single integer m, the index of the road that will be blocked (0 ≤ m < M).  Output For each query m in the input, output an integer - the minimum distance the Prime minister has to travel to reach home from the Parliament if the anti-corruption movement blocks only the road m. If blocking the road prevents the Prime Minister from reaching home, print "no route for corrupt ministers!!!" (quotes for clarity).   Example  Input: 1 4 4 2 0 1 2 1 2 2 0 2 3 2 3 4 2 3  Output: 8 no route for corrupt ministers!!!  
After the first series of protests disrupted the road traffic in Dystopia, the government decided to take counter measures. It chose a few of the roads as high priority roads and sent military vehicles to patrol them. The roads were chosen in a way that it was possible to move from any junction to any other junction just using the patrolled roads. Also, the number of roads chosen was the minimum possible (N-1, where N is the number of junctions). After this, people were able to travel without hindrance from the protestors and the protest wasn't taken seriously anymore. Hence the leader of the protest decided to take things to the next level. He decided that he would personally lead the group which blocks one of the patrolled roads - The military would not dare to touch the group then. Blocking a patrolled road would divide the road network into two parts A and B such that it would be possible to travel between every pair of junctions in A (and every pair of junctions in B) using patrolled roads alone but it would not be possible to move from a junction in A to a junction in B using patrolled roads alone. People then have to take unpatrolled roads with one junction in A and the other in B. The leader terms the number of such inter-part roads as the inconvinence factor for the patrolled road being blocked. Given the road network, find out the maximum inconvenience factor achievable by choosing the patrolled road to block.  Input The first line of the input contains T, the number of test cases (T ≤ 5). Following this are the descriptions of the T test cases. The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers N and M - The number of junctions and unpatrolled roads in the network(1 ≤ N ≤ 10000; 0 ≤ M ≤ 30000). Following this are N-1 lines, describing the patrolled roads in the network. Each line will contain two space separated integers i and j, denoting that there is a patrolled road between i and j. This is followed by M lines describing the unpatrolled roads in a similar fashion. You are assured that there is not more than one direct road between any pair of junctions.  Output For each test case, print the maximum value of inconvenience factor achievable among all the possible choices of the patrolled road to be blocked.  Example  Input: 1 6 3 0 1 1 2 1 3 3 4 3 5 0 2 0 4 4 5  Output: 2 
 You are a young spy in the army of the Jedi, posted on the outer rim of the Tatooine. You learn that Darth Vader’s army is on the way to attack the Planet. You want to save Tatooine and you need help of the Jedi Council to defeat the army of Darth Vader. To seek Jedi help you have to inform the Jedi Council sitting at the Jedi Temple which is very far from where you are. You have a pod with you which runs on electricity and you would like to use it to travel to the Jedi Temple. But the battery of your pod lasts for only a fixed amount of time, C. There are many service stations on your way from the outer rim to the Jedi Temple and luckily for you, some of these allow you to recharge your pod’s battery. You are in a hurry and want to reach the Jedi Temple in as little time as possible. If you are late, then it might be impossible to save the peaceful planet of Tatooine from the dark forces of Darth Vader’s army. Given the time needed to travel between the service stations, you are asked to output the minimum time in which you would be able to reach the Jedi Temple.  Input The first line of each input contains four space separated integers, N M P C where  N: The number of service stations including 0 for the starting point and N-1 as the location of the Jedi Temple. M: The number of 1-length paths existing between pairs of N service stations P: The number of service stations which allow you to recharge your battery C: The maximum time for which your battery runs, after you had charged it completely   The next line contains P space separated integers denoting the service stations which allow you to recharge. This is followed by M lines, each containing three space separated numbers X Y T where T is the time required to travel between X and Y Assume that the initial charge in the pod is 0 and it takes negligible time to recharge your battery at the service stations (After all, being in Jedi army has its perks ;) ).  Output Output a single integer t which is the time required to travel from your initial position to the Jedi Temple. If it is not possible for you to reach the Jedi temple, print -1.  Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 300 1 ≤ M ≤ min(n*(n-1)/2, 5*10^4) 1 ≤ P ≤ N 1 ≤ C ≤ 10^7 0 ≤ X ≤ N-1 0 ≤ Y ≤ N-1 0 ≤ T ≤ 10^4   Example Input: 6 5 2 250 0 4 0 1 200 1 2 30 2 3 10 3 4 10 2 5 230  Output: 500 
 Bob is extremely bored, so he thinks of a game to play in the meanwhile. The game is as follows. He takes two integers N and M and tries to find twice the sum of the quotients of the integer division of (i * N) by M varying i from 0 to M-1 both included. But as he started computing the sums for larger values of M and N, things started becoming very complex. So he has asked for your help. You need to output the sum that Bob needs.  Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each of the next T lines contains two space separated integers M and N.  Output For each test case, output a single line containing the answer.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ M,N ≤ 10^8   Example Input: 1 2 3  Output: 2  
  In the present world, Operating System is one of the most important tool. Its a big business and a lot of profit is generated by the operating system developers depending on the features they have implemented in their OS, which are demanded/required by the users. In one such instance, an operating system developer IOPC (International Operating Product Creators) developed a special type of operating system for their users. Their operating system had the following structure: The user is initially given a root directory, and the user is allowed to create new directories. Every time he creates a new directory, he must create a link between the new one and exactly one of the existing directories making sure that the new directory is accessible from the root directory. This structure gave them special features like there is only one way to move from one directory to another directory through the links created. For ease of debugging, they named their directories with integer values. Their product created a new revolution in the market. However, in a short time, another operating system developer Copycat Operating Systems (CCOS) launched a very similar OS with exactly the same features. Although the OS manual of the new product in the market had different numbers assigned to their directories. But IOPC detected foul play and are convinced that CCOS have stolen their code and just made some minor changes in it and presented it as their own. Since, you are one of the top programmers in the world. They have asked for your help to resolve this issue. After sufficient study, you have reached the conclusion that if the internal structure of the file system of two operating systems match after performing a certain set of operations on both of them, then they are the same. So, to ease your work, you have designed a test suite for this verification purpose. Your test contains performing some operations on both the operating systems and see what links are formed in each of the file systems. However, due to shortage of time, you forgot to ensure that the test suite performs the tests on both the operating systems in the same order. However, you are able to get the generated links and the root directory of the operating systems. Given this information, you have to print whether the Copycat Operating Systems have actually copied from IOPC or they just got lucky in developing a similar system.  Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description for each of the test cases starts from a new line. The first line of input for each test case contains an integer N, the number of directories (including the root) generated in the file systems of both the OS by the test suite. Next, follow descriptions for the file system (root and links structure) for both the operating systems, one after the other, each beginning from a new line and each containing N lines. The first line for each of the OS, contains an integer  R, the integer corresponding to the root. The next N-1 lines describe the link structure with the i^th line containing two space separated integers Ai Bi meaning that there’s a link between the directories with integer names Ai and Bi.  Output  The output must contain as many lines as the number of test cases T. For each test case print 1 if both the operating systems generate structurally same file systems (root and link structure) of directories when operated upon by the test suite, otherwise print 0.  Constraints  T ≤ 3 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 0 ≤ Ai, Bi, R ≤ N-1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ N-1   Example Input: 1 2 0 0 1 0 1 0  Output: 1     Note:  This problem will be tested on Cube (Pentium G860 3GHz)  
  Ted (the popular talking bear) has been given a job at the printing firm. Looking at his previous employment record, the firm is watching very strictly on his work product. Recently, he has been assigned a task to print on a square sheet of dimension NxN. You may think of the sheet containing N^2 cells of dimension 1x1 each. Since, Ted is a lazy bear, he somehow steals two stamps, a horizontal printing stamp which covers a 1*2 block and a vertical printing stamp which covers a 3*1 block. He may use these two stamps in any order and as many times as he wants. But the sheets are old, if the sheet is stamped twice at any cell, it will tear off. Now, there is a shipment of sheets coming with varying sizes. But he observes that in some of the cases it is not possible to completely fill the square sheet with no overlapping stamps. So, he asks for your help in deciding whether it is possible to fill the square sheet with the stamps without any overlapping.  Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T, denoting the number of sheets in the shipment. It is followed by T lines each containing a single integer N denoting the side of the square sheet.  Output  For each test case, output a single line containing “YES” (without quotes) if it is possible to fill the square sheet without overlapping the stamps and “NO” (without quotes) otherwise.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 5*10^5 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6   Example Input: 1 2  Output: YES  
  Ned is quite bored in class. As he is very interested in Mathematics, he decides to develop a new number system which he would name after himself. Unlike the other “traditional” number systems, his system does not have “low-level” relationships like successors, predecessors etc. Rather the system is modeled in such a way that it has entities represented by numbers which are related via very complex classes and a mathematical relation R. The relation R is symmetric i.e. if  a R b , then  b R a but is not transitive.  He then asks his arch-rival Ted to solve a problem in this number system. The problem is to find a subset of a given set of N entities which satisfies the following property.  For every element a in this subset, the number of distinct elements in the subset which are related to a with the relation R is at-least K.  Ted, being a phony, runs to you for help. Help him in finding such a subset.  Input  The first line of input contains three space separated integers, N, the number of distinct entities, M, the number of different class relations and K, the size of this subset.

 Alice has been recruited as a new Professor at IIT Kanpur. There are a total of n+1 students in her class each having a unique rank in the range 0 to n. Each student gives a choice of having nCr assignments (r is the unique rank of that student), where nCr is the coefficient of the r^th term in the expansion of (1+x)^n. Alice loves her students so much that she wants her students to learn and do as many assignments as possible. She has gone crazy and thus she wants to give the minimum number (K, the same for all students) of assignments to each of her student, where K is divisible by the number of assignments requested by each of her students. She asks you for help. Help her to find the number of assignments she needs to give. As the answer can be very large, output it modulo 10^9+7.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. This is followed by T lines each containing an integer n.  Output One line for each test case, giving the number of assignments (K) Alice needs to give to her students.  Constraints  T ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5   Example Input: 3 1 4 5  Output: 1 12 10  
 Master Yoda is teaching a young Padawan learner, an IIT Kanpur student, the knowledge and powers of a Jedi. During his training, one of the tasks he has to accomplish is to fly a starship across a 3D maze created by Master Yoda for his training. The maze is filled with virtual droids of the Empire’s Army at certain cells. The student has to fly the starship across the maze such that at no time the starship is in the same cell with any of the droids, otherwise he will fail the test and will be kicked out of the Jedi Training Camp. Description of the maze: The Maze is a 3-D grid of size (N+2) x C x D. It is a vertical stack of D layers where each layer is a 2-D grid containing N+2 rows and C columns. The first (index 0) and the last (index N+1) rows of each layer are filled with ‘O’ (open positions in the Maze), except that one cell in the first row of some layer will be marked ‘S’, the starting position of the student and his starship, and one cell in the last row of some layer will be marked with ‘D’, his destination. Every other cell in this grid will either contain an enemy droid marked with ‘X’ or an empty space marked with ‘O’.  The starship has an intelligent R2D2 robot installed which guides the student in flying the starship and deciding his path. The configuration of the grid is stored in the memory of R2D2. It is well known that Master Yoda is a very strict teacher when it comes to Jedi training. He has already computed the minimum number of moves it will take the student  to fly from the starting point and reach the destination already feeded in R2D2. Master Yoda realised that if the drones in the maze are kept static, it is too easy for R2D2 to plan a path. Thus, Yoda decides to use his Jedi powers to set the Maze in motion, moving certain rows and columns of all the layers, to add some difficulty to the task. But he won’t move the first and the last rows of any layer (which keeps ‘S’ and ‘D’ positions static), since that will be too much for a young Padawan learner, only the masters practice in such a grid.   As soon as the Young Padawan Learner (IITK student) starts the flight, Yoda sets the maze in motion. In each layer, the rows with indices 0 and N+1 remain stationary. For the first layer (the bottom-most layer which is index 0), the row with index 1 is moved towards the right 1 cell at a time (i.e. one cell to the right in each move). The row with index 2 moves to the left, row with index 3 to the right and so on. For the rest of the layers, each row (except rows with indices 0 and N+1) move in the direction opposite to that of the row just below. All the rows move one cell at a time (i.e. one cell in each move). The row motion is modular i.e. whatever position (‘X’ or ‘O’) leaves the corner of the maze on any side, comes back in the same row, the same layer on the other side.  Description of the motion for the starship: At all times, the starship must remain in the 3-D Maze of dimensions (N+2) x C x D. In each move, the starship may stay in its current cell or may move to the cell just adjacent to it, i.e. the starship may move one cell either to its right, or to its left in the same row, or one cell up or down in its column, or one cell up to the layer stacked above it or one cell down to the layer underneath keeping the row and columns indices the same. The motion of the starship isn’t modular unlike that of the rows. Although, the starship can’t share a cell with any droid at all times, it may jump over an approaching droid in the same row. It means if a droid is in the neighbouring cell of the starship, in the next move, both of them can exchange their positions without the student failing.    Input  The first line of the input contains an integer M denoting the maximum number of moves allowed. The next line contains three space separated integers N C and D denoting the dimensions of the Maze. The next N+2 lines contain C characters denoting the layer 0 of the Maze The next N+2 lines contain C characters denoting the layer 1 of the Maze . The next N+2 lines contain C characters denoting the layer D-1 of the Maze  Output Output an integer denoting the minimum number of moves needed to reach the destination. If it is not possible to reach the destination in less than equal to M moves then output -1  Constraints  1 ≤ M ≤ 4000 1 ≤ N ≤ 100 1 ≤ C ≤ 100 1 ≤ D ≤ 10   Example Input: 20 2 3 1 OOS OOO XXO OOD Output: 5  
  Alice is teaching a class of N+1 students and she is planning a picnic for her students. Each of her students is given a distinct rank between 0 and N for identification which makes sure they don’t get lost during the picnic. She has brought with her many bags each completely filled with N^2chocolates. She wants to distribute them among her students. But, like every other teacher, she is not going to give them without making them do some math problems first. So, she asks each of her students to choose a number k equal to his/her rank, and do the following :   Find out the number of ways of selecting k chocolates from a set of N distinct chocolates.  Add his/her rank to N to get N’ and again find out the number of ways of selecting k chocolates from a set of N’ distinct chocolates.   She will give each of her students x * y chocolates, where x is the number that the student computed in the first step and y is the number computed in the second step. Now after calculating how many chocolates she will give in total, she starts taking them out from her bags. She picks a completely filled bag at first and starts taking out chocolates out until the bag is empty. Then, she chooses another completely filled bag and follows the same procedure. She wonders how much chocolates she will have to remove from the last bag.  As a programmer, she asks for your help to find out the number of chocolates she will have to remove from the last bag.  Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Next follow T lines each containing an integer N for the test case. Assume that N is guaranteed to be a prime number.  Output  For each test case, output one line containing the number of chocolates Alice needs to remove from the last bag.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ N ≤ 31113   Example Input: 1 2  Output: 1  
  Princess Leia is trapped in Alderaan. C3PO and R2D2 get in the country to save her. There are bombs kept at various locations which C3PO and R2D2 have been able to figure out. They don’t know where Princess Leia is, therefore they decide to dispose all the bombs off to ensure her safety. But as they have already used most of their strength in figuring out where the bombs are, they don’t have much strength left and want to dispose all the bombs by moving as less as possible. So they decide to split. They can start at any of the bombs’ locations, but unfortunately the bombs have been programmed such that if a bomb i is diffused after a bomb j with i < j then the i^th bomb and all the other remaining bombs get detonated; thereby killing the princess. Though R2D2 and C3PO have split, they can still communicate with each other. R2D2 uses his analytical skills to figure out a way in which they should proceed, but it is not optimal. You need to help them in saving the princess by minimizing the sum of the total manhattan distance R2D2 travels and the total manhattan distance C3PO travels. You need to output the minimum sum over all possible ways in which they can diffuse all the bombs.   Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. First line of each test case is the number of bombs N. Each of the next n lines contains three space separated integers, where the i^th line contains xi yi zi, the coordinates of the i^th bomb.  Output  For each test case output a single line containing the minimum sum of the total manhattan distance R2D2 travels and total manhattan distance C3PO travels in order to dispose all the bombs off.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 5 ≤ N ≤ 1000 0 ≤ x,y,z ≤ 5000   Example Input: 1 3 2 3 4 0 4 5 3 4 1  Output: 4   Explanation C3PO starts at (2,3,4) and R2D2 starts at (3,4,1). C3PO first diffuses the bomb 1, then it moves to (0,4,5) to defuse bomb 2 then C3PO diffuses bomb 3. So the total distance they need to move is 4. 
  A group of students thought of creating a different VOIP network. The network, rather than being any general graph, was a tree. Every user was assigned a unique userid. This network was hierarchical, i.e there was an admin. The parent of a user is the user connected to it on the unique path when it calls the admin. All users had a parent user except the admin.  All was working fine, until a weird problem occurred in the network. It so happened that a user was only able to call his parent user. Every user (including admin) was unable to reach any of his children. Although we can see that some users can still send a message to other users. A user u can't call the parent g of his parent p (i.e. his grandparent g) but still he can send a message to his grandparent g. u can achieve this by calling p and asking p to call g and send u's message to g.  Your task is to tell, given the userid x and userid y, whether x will be able to send a message to y.   Input  The first line of the input contains two space separated integers N, the total number of users (including admin) in the VOIP network and Q, the number of queries. The next line contains the userid U of the admin. Each of the next N-1 lines contains two space separated integers x and y indicating that user x is the parent of user y. Next in the input are the queries you need to answer. There are Q lines each containing two space separated integers x and y.  Output  For each query output a single line containing 1 if x can send a message to y -1 if y can send a message to x 0 otherwise  Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ Q ≤ 10^5 0 ≤ U ≤ N-1 0 ≤ x,y ≤ N-1   Example Input: 3 2 1 1 2 1 0 0 1 0 2  Output: 1 0

Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. This is followed by T lines each containing two space separated integers, n and p.  Output One line for each test case, giving the value of the required expression.  Constraints  T ≤ 10 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 1 ≤ p ≤ 10^7   Example Input: 1 5 3 Output: 1 
  It is a very bad time in the North. Lord Eddard Stark has been killed, the castle has been destroyed and Lady Catelyn is not in the kingdom. To add to the difficulties, “Winter is Coming”. The kingdom of North is composed of houses and roads connecting these houses.  Winters in the North are very harsh and it becomes almost impossible to leave your house. So, this time, the King in the North has devised an intelligent plan of converting some of the existing roads into tunnels, so that people can walk freely inside them and move from any place to another place i.e. for each house there is a path to every other house through the tunnels. For this he hires some builders to complete this task. All of them submit a plan. The king has to decide which builder to give the contract to.The King will choose the contractor which submits a plan with the minimum cost. Now you need to tell whether the King can decide and choose one of the contractors deterministically or not.  Input The first line contains two space separated integers N M where  N: The number of houses M: The number of roads  The next M lines contain three space separated integers A B R each, which denotes that cost of constructing a tunnel between houses A and B is R. Assume that the tunnels are bidirectional.  Output  One line containing “YES” (without quotes) if the King can choose deterministically otherwise "NO" (without quotes).  Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ M ≤ min(2*10^5, N*(N-1)/2) 0 ≤ A,B ≤ N-1 1 ≤ R ≤ 10^9   Example Input: 4 4 0 1 100 1 2 5 1 3 70 2 3 1000  Output: YES  
 Students’ Gymkhana, IIT Kanpur has started horse-racing games as a refreshment activity in the campus where the students can take part in horse racing on evenings and weekends. But since everyone is very busy with their academics and upcoming Techkriti, they have decided to outsource the organisational responsibilities of the races to a company. But unfortunately, the company people are very corrupt. The take bribes from people to place their horses already ahead of the starting line before the start of the race. As a neutral observer, you are given the task to find out which of the N horses taking part in the race would be leading at a given time in the contest. The horses are indexed  from 0 to N-1.  Input The first of the input contains T, the number of test cases. The description of each test case begins on a new line and is as follows:  two space separated integers N, the number of horses and Q, the number of queries. N lines for the horses indexed from 0 to N-1 in order, each containing 2 space separated integers D and S; where, D is the initial distance of the horse from the starting line and S is its speed. All the horses run uniformly at their individual speeds. Q lines each containing an integer t, which is the query time.   Output For each query time t, output a line containing a single integer which is the index of the horse leading at that instant of time. If two horses are leading together at that time, print the index of the horse which will be ahead a split second later.

Input The first line contains a single integer T, which denotes the number of test cases. Each test case begins with a line containing two space separated integers N and M, where N and M are the number of vertices and the number of edges, respectively. The next M lines each contain two space separated integers X and Y, which denotes that there is an edge between vertices X and Y.  Output A single line per test case containing an integer which denotes the number of free subtrees in the corresponding graph. Since the answer can be very large, output it modulo 10^9+7.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ N ≤ 100 1 ≤ M ≤ N*(N-1)/2 0 ≤ X,Y ≤ N-1   Example Input: 1 5 6 0 1 1 4 3 4 2 3 1 3 0 2  Output: 11

In the kingdom of Baratheons, there is a strict hierarchy in the army. The leader of the army is the king under whose command are a set of soldiers. Each soldier commands a certain section of army, that is there are certain soldiers under him who may be commanding some more soldiers, and the similar hierarchical structure is followed downwards, till the lowest rank of soldiers. Note that if soldier A commands soldier B and B commands C, then C also comes under the purview of A, however it will be said that B is under the direct command of A and C is under the direct command of B. Also note that each soldier has a unique hierarchical path to the king. The army commission, a different body, may decide to give certain units of power to a particular section of the army. To do this, the commission gives K units of power to the soldier commanding a section, which is cloned and each soldier under his command, including himself, receives K units of power. Remember, initially all soldiers have zero units of power. In times of war, a team of soldiers may be selected from across sections. The team is selected in the following way: given two soldiers A and B, all the soldiers in the path through the hierarchical structure from A to B, are included in the team. For such a team, you have to calculate the total power of the team.  Input Format First line contains three space separated integers N, K and R. N represents the number of soldiers R represents the id of the king. Next N-1 lines describes the hierarchical structure. Each line consists of two integers A and B, signifying that soldier B is under the direct command of soldier A. K following lines represent operations of the following types.For a query operation, the first character is Q, followed by two space separated integers X and Y.For an update operation, the first character is U, followed by two space separated integers S and T, such that the soldier S is given T units of power to be cloned and distributed to soldiers under his command.  Output Format For each query operation, output the total power of all soldiers in the path through the hierarchical structure from X to Y.  Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 1e5 1 ≤ K ≤ 1e5 1 ≤ X,Y,S ≤ 1e5 Absolute(T) ≤ 1000    Sample Input 5 3 1 1 2 1 3 3 4 3 5 U 3 5 Q 4 5 Q 4 1  Sample Output 15 10  Explanation Initially all soldiers have 0 power. When the update operation is executed, soldiers 3, 4 and 5 get 5 units of power. For the first query, all soldiers in the path from 4 to 5 are added up, i.e, power(4) + power(3) + power(5) = 15, is given as output. For second query, all soldiers in the path from 4 to 1 are added up, i.e., power(4) + power(3) + power(1) = 10, is given as output.

Santa and Banta are buddies. Santa has a good sense of humour, but Banta is unable to or partially understands some jokes. Now Santa has with him N jokes he wishes to tell to Banta. Due to lack of time, he cannot tell all of them and has to choose R jokes for Banta. The total value of all the jokes he tells Banta is Fibonacci ( ^N C R ). Note that, Fibonacci(1)=Fibonacci(2)=1 and Fibonacci(n)=Fibonacci(n-1)+Fibonacci(n-2) for n > 2. However, Banta is unable to comprehend all the jokes.

In an exam in IIT Kanpur, the question paper consists of infinite questions. Ram, being a studious guy, aims to attempt infinite questions. In the i-th question, Ram answers are worth R[i] marks. However, he does not know the answer to all, and instead of thinking about the questions, repeats his answer after every S questions, i.e., the answer given by Ram for the K-th question is same as the answer for (K - S)-th  question and so the marks obtained for question K and question K-S are also the same. Shyam, on the other hand, hardly studies and has made up his mind to attempt atmost N questions. He plans to copy the answer to these questions from Ram. If Shyam wishes to write answers to all between question X and question Y, he wants to know the corresponding answers by Ram for all questions between M and M+Y-X, where M is a parameter decided by Shyam. For each answer copied, he would earn same marks as Ram earned for the corresponding answer. If at the end of the exam, Shyam has not attempted any of the N questions, he receives zero marks for that question. Now while correcting Shyam's answer sheet, the teacher wishes to check answers for questions between A and B.

The Fiendish Bombers, unleashed by Emporer Terrorin, have invaded Bungeling Empire in Bomber Nebula. You are Dr.Ein, the scientist assisting the Bomberman. Help him to save Planet Bomber! Consider the Empire as (N+2)x(N+2) maze free of any rocks and obstacles. The Fiendish Bombers have reached the borders of the Empire. They are present on all border cells of the maze except the corners (they don’t like to be cornered :P). Now consider the remaining NxN maze. Some cells are with counter-explosive devices and so bombs cannot be planted there. The bombs can be planted anywhere on the remaining maze. Because of one of the new invention, the Fire, ability of the Bomberman’s bomb is infinite. That is, if it explodes at (a,b) it will destroy enemies from all the cells on the horizontal line through (a,b) and on the vertical line passing through (a,b). Note that it would not affect any of the counter-explosive devices. You have an encrypted connection with the Bomberman and can message him (a,b), the coordinates where a bomb can be planted. The cost of each message is M. But the problem is, you forgot to agree upon the directions of the axis while deciding the origin.  So, when you message (a,b), Bomberman plants 2 bombs - on (a,b) and on (b,a) (provided they are distinguishable). Also, it is ensured that there is a counter-explosive device on (a,b) if and only if there is a counter-explosive device on (b,a). Your task is to minimize the cost of eliminating all enemies. Print a single integer, the cost of eliminating all the 4*N enemies. Print IMPOSSIBLE if it is impossible to do so. Input    There are several test cases.  Each test case begins with two integers:  N - denoting size of the grid and M - denoting cost of single message.  N lines follow. Each containing a string of N characters describing the cells of corresponding row. “#” denotes cell with counter-explosive device and “.” denotes free cell.

Problem Description In the world of Mathematics, there are ordinary numbers and there are special numbers. The special numbers are Transformers. The transformers are of two types - Autobots and Decepticons. Autobots have the task of saving the number-kind from the evil intentions of Decepticons. A number C is said to be equivalent to another number D if C%k = D%k, where k is a given parameter. The Transformers are called so because of their special ability to transform to something else. Now, given a value Q, a transformer N wishes to transform to another value P such that P is equivalent to Q.However, like all mortal beings, they too have restrictions, they can only take some particular transformations. The following transformations are allowed N -> N + a N -> N - b N -> N * c N -> N % d You have to report minimum number of steps to transform to such a value P (which is equivalent to Q) using the above transformations, or print -1 if it is impossible to do so.  Input Format First line contains T, the number of test cases. T lines follow, each containing 7 space separated integers, N, a, b, c, d, k, q.  Output Format The output consists of T lines. Each line contains the output of the corresponding test case, i.e., the minimum number of transformations required or -1, if transformation is not possible.

Rob likes to explore but is lazy. He has many cubes arranged before him in a line. Each cube has either the letter 'A' or 'B' inscribed on it. Now Rob wants to swap any two positions of cubes placed on the line, such that the there exists a sequence of continuous cubes with letter 'A' inscribed on them, whose number is greater than or equal to M. However, mechanically swapping cubes is a tedious task. Therefore he wishes to know the minimum number of swap operations he has to perform to get such an arrangement of cubes.  Input Format First line consists of T test cases. For each test case, first line consists of the string S, composed of A's and B's, representing the initial configuration of cubes, and second line an integer M.  Output Format The output consists of T lines corresponding to T test cases, such that it is the minimum number of operations required to create a consecutive segment of greater than M A’s from S.  Constraints  1 ≤ Sum of lengths of S over all test cases ≤ 10^6 1 ≤ Length(S) ≤ 10^5  It is ensured that number of A's are ≥ M.    Sample Input 1 ABA 2  Sample Output 1

Mr. Devu Singh has a farm. The farm is represented as a matrix, divided into rows and columns, with each element being equal to 1, if the corresponding area in the farm contains a tree, and 0 otherwise. Every element in the farm can contain atmost one tree. Mr. Devu Singh loves his farm. However, Devu Singh has a short memory. He cannot remember which of the elements in the farm has a tree in them. What he does remember is the total number of trees in each row and each column, but is not sure about this information either. He wishes to know, that for such constraints, whether there exists a matrix satisfying these constraints. If there does exist such a matrix, output the lexicographically smallest one, otherwise output -1. For lexicographically comparing two matrices A and B, you write the matrix A and B as a string of 0/1 by writing in row major order (ie, first write first row, then second row and so on upto n-th row.). Now lexicographically compare the two strings generated in this way.  Input Format First line contains T : number of test cases. For each test case, first line has N and M. Next line contains N space separated integers where i-th one represents sum of the i-th row. Line after that contains M space separated integers where i-th one represents sum of i-th column.  Output Format For the i-th test case, the first line contains the string "TestCase #:i" (without quotes). From the next line, output matrix of size N x M, as N lines containing M integers each (without space), with Element[i,j] = 0 or 1, depending on whether there can be a tree in that area. Output ­-1, if no such matrix exists.

 One day Abhinav was teaching little Shark about data structures and algorithms related to trees. He told that given a rooted tree T containing N nodes, numbered from 1 to N, rooted at node 1. Pre-order array of the tree can be obtained by doing pre-order depth first search on the tree, starting from node 1 and recursively visiting the subtrees rooted at the children of the root. For example, given a tree containing 5 nodes and following pair of nodes are connected via direct edge -   1 2  1 3  2 4  2 5 then pre order array can be -  1 2 4 5 3. Clearly there are many possible pre-order array for a given tree. e.g, (1 3 2 5 4) is also a valid pre order array for the given tree. Then Abhinav told little Shark that all the nodes in the subtree rooted at a node, say nd appears consecutively in the pre-order array ! For example, nodes in the subtree rooted at nd = 2 in the given example are 2, 4 and 5. Clearly these numbers appears consecutively in the pre-order array starting at index 2 (1 based index). This is true for any pre-order array for the tree. You may verify that.  Little Shark got the point Abhinav was trying to make. But after pondering over the concept for some time he asked Abhinav can we recover the tree if pre-order array is given !    In this problem you will be given pre-order array of a tree and some clues about some of the subtrees of the tree. You need to find a tree satisfying the given clues and has at least one pre-order traversal as given in the input.   Clues will be given in the from three integers nd, l and r . Denoting that nodes of the subtree rooted at node nd lies consecutively in the given pre-order array from index l to r. Can you find the tree ?   Input  The first line of the input contains a single integer N denoting the size of the tree (size of the pre-order array). The second line contains N space-separated integers denoting the elements of the pre-order array. Next line contains an integer Q denoting the number of clues given. Next Q lines each contains three space separated integers denoting nd, l and r respectively as described in the problem statement.   Output  First line of the output should contain an integer f. If there is no such tree satisfying all the clues, then f should be equal to 0. Otherwise it should be equal to 1. If f = 1 then in next N-1 lines print the edges of the tree. Each line should contain two integers u and v denoting there is direct edge between node u and node v in the tree. Output must satisfy a valid tree structure.   Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 100000 1 ≤ Q ≤ 100000 1 ≤ nd ≤ N 1 ≤ l  ≤ r  ≤ N Elements of the preorder array will be between 1 and N (both inclusive).     Example Input: 4 1 2 3 4 4 1 1 4 2 2 4 3 3 4 4 4 4  Output: 1 1 2 2 3 3 4

N * (N - 1) / 2 lines follow, each containing a pair i j meaning team i defeated team j in their match     Output  If it is not possible to make the world cup weird by changing some results, print -1. If it is possible, print the smallest number of matches changing whose result will make the world cup weird. Then print each match (represented by the pair of team number) in a new line. If there are multiple answers possible, print any one of them. Pair u v  and v u  are the same.     Constraints  4 ≤ N ≤ 10^3 Each pair i j appears exactly once in the input     Example Input: 4 1 2 1 3 4 1 2 3 4 2 4 3  Output: 1 3 4

Output For each test case, ie., for each number F, display whether or not the number is a Fibonacci number. Each test case output should occupy its own line. Print "YES" if it is a Fibonacci number else print "NO" (Both without quotes).   Constraints 1 ≤ T ≤ 100000 0 ≤ F < 2^64   Sample Input 2 34 1233   Sample Output YESNO   Explanation  34 is the 10^th Fibonacci number. 1233 is not a Fibonacci number.    
On a Planet where people are obssessed with Numbers, they have human definitions for relation among Numbers. In one such case, they have designated a father number to be a number formed by the sum of the child number's digits along with the child number itself. For example, for number 481, (4+8+1+481=)494 is the father. It is of course evident, every son will have a father, but a person (number) may have any number of children, even zero. Your task is to write a program to find the smallest child of a given integer, should it exist.   Input Your first line of input consists of 'K' (1 ≤ K ≤ 50) test cases. The number of test cases 'K' is given in the first line of the input followed by a blank line. Each test case takes one line containing an integer N , (20 ≤ N ≤ 100,000).    Output The output of your program will print exactly one line for each test case. The line is to contain a child of N for each test case. If X has more than one child, print the smallest. If X, however, does not have any children, print "NONE". The following shows sample input and output for three test cases.  Example  Input:  3 216 121 2005  Output:  198 NONE 1979  
Hackers! Hackers! Everywhere! Some days back your email ID was hacked. Some one read the personal messages and Love Letters you sent to your girl friend. That's a terrible thing, well, you know how are the boys at ISM. So, you have decided that from now onwards you will write Love Letters to your girlfriend in a different way. Suppose you want to write "i love you sweet heart", then you will write "I evol uoy teews traeh".   Input First line will contain the number of test cases T, not more than 20. Each test case will contain a line of not more than 100 characters and all the characters will be small alphabets only ('a'-'z'). There will be exactly one space between two words.    Output For each test case output a single line in the new format.   Example  Input: 3 can you meet me outside ccd today a this year hard kaur is coming to entertain us   Output: nac uoy teem em edistuo dcc yadot a siht raey drah ruak si gnimoc ot niatretne su  
Chef's kid, Junior chef loves playing with different series. Chef, impressed by his son's curiosity, gifts him a special series S on his birthday  S=1,2,-2,3,-3,3,4,-4,4,-4,............. Now chef, eager to check the intelligence of his son, gives him q queries to solve. Each query consists of two positions a and b, and Junior_chef is required to calculate the sum of all integers from a to b.  Input  The first line of the input contains a single integer q, which denotes the number of queries. Next q lines consist of two integers, a and b.  Output Print the answer in single line.  Constraints 1<=q<=10 , 1<=a,b<=10^12  Sample Input 1 1 4  Sample Output 4 Explanation : As the series is 1,2,-2,3, therefore the sum will be 4. 
Junior_chef is very fond of cakes. But as they aren't good for his health, chef doesn't wants him to access the cakes easily. So he has devised a game for him. Chef has rectangular pieces of cakes and the length of each cake is L cm. The cake can only be cut at certain points. Junior_chef is needed to calculate the number of 'good' pieces. A 'good' piece is the one which, after cutting the cake at two distinct positions has a length greater than k cm.  Input  The first line of the input contains the number of test cases t (1<=t<=200). Each of the next t lines consists of two lines. The first line consists of three integers : L, length of the cake (3<=L<=5*10^4), N, total number of points where the cake can be cut (2<=N<=MIN(L-1,10^4)) and K (0<=K<=L-1). The second line of each test case contains N distinct integer array A, where each integer denotes the point where the cake can be cut(in cm) 1<=A[i]<=L-1.  Output Print the answer in single line.  Sample Input 2 10 2 6 1 3 10 3 5 1 3 9  Sample Output 1 3  Explanation For the 1st test case, if the cake is cut at 1cm and 3cm, three pieces will be generated of length 1cm,2cm,7cm.As the length of the third piece is greater than 6, it's a 'good' piece. For the 2nd test case,all three possible pairs will be 'good' pieces 
Junior_chef got a task at school to collect S  pencils. Each day he can collect only one pencil. As S can be a very large number so it could take many days to complete the task, but then he remembers that his father,chef gave him the magic that can double anything (i.e if he has 2 pencils, the magic will make them to 4 pencils). Junior_chef can use this magic any number of time on the collected pencil on a particular day and add this to the previously collected pencils. Remember that he wants exactly S pencils and he can't throw any pencil. If he gets more than S pencils then he gets 0 marks. Help him to collect exactly S pencils in minimum number of days.  Input  :  The first line of the input contains the number of test cases t (1<=t<=10^5). Then next t lines contains a single number S (0 <= S <= 10^9), which is number of pencils Junior_chef has to collect. Output : For each test case, output the minimum number of days taken by Junior_chef  to complete the task. .  Sample Input 2 1 3  Sample Output 1 2  Explanation In the second case when s = 3, he will collect 1 stone on the first day and double it and collect the remaining one on the next day. 
Junior_chef  and his classmates love a girl named Alice and want her to sit with them. But Alice, being a lover of Mathematics will only sit with the boy who can calculate the correct impressions of a problem. The problem goes like this - each student is given an identical string of length L. The impressions of a string is the number of such sub-sequences (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsequence) of a string which have an odd length n(n ≥ 3) and possess the unique property, the middle most character of the string is 'o' and all other characters are 'l'.So if length n=5,the string "lloll" has an impression 1.  Input  :  The first line of the input contains the number of test cases t (1<=t<=10). Each test case consists two inputs: The string S having length L(1<=L<=100000) and the length of the string 'n' to be searched in S,(1<=n<=S-1),n is odd. Output :Print the impressions of the string modulo  10^9+7(1000000007),as the output might overflow. .  Sample Input 2 lol 3 ollollo 5  Sample Output 1 1  Explanation In the first test case, the string 'lol' satisfies the condition so it has a impression 1. In the second test case the only string that satisfies the condition is 'lloll' so it has a impression 1. P.S. : Both the test cases are having Continuous good strings. 
Every one knows that Dhoni is not a superstitious player and believes in team  game play and always gives credit to his boys for winning. But as every Indian mother, Dhoni's mother is superstitious and is very upset as her son has retired from test cricket. She wants her son to win this world cup which could be last for him . She visits a fortune teller, the ORACLE. Oracle takes the Jercy number of all the players in Indian team and wants to do certain operation on it. She writes all the number on a piece of paper in binary format, arranges them in order of increasing number of  1's and then takes XOR operation between all the numbers. If the resulting number contains more than X number of  1's then India wins, otherwise India looses. Here X is the date on which the game is to be played.  Input First line contains the number of test cases. For each test case first line contains 15 space separated integers, which is the jercy number of each player. Next line of the test case contains the date X on which day the game is to be played.  Output Output YES if India will win, otherwise print NO  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10^6 1 ≤ Jercy No. ≤ 2^31 1 ≤ X ≤ 31   Example Input: 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 12  Output: NO 
A certain business farm has introduced a loyalty program. At the time of registration to the loyalty program, a customer is given 1 point. The points will get upgraded after the first new purchase every week. After such purchase, the customer can select between the following two policies to upgrade points:  Get exactly 1 more point Double the points that he/she has  For example, if the customer had 43 points before a purchase, he/she can upgrade it to 44 or 86, depending upon points upgrade policy of their choosing. At the time of registration, each customer is also given a Jackpot target. Special facilities will be provided to the customer if the accumulated points of the customer become equal to this Jackpot. However, accumulating points more or less than the Jackpot does not earn them anything. For example, for a customer with Jackpot target 437, special facilities will be provided if and only if his/her points becomes exactly equal to 437 after some purchases. Of course the simplest plan that may be adopted by the customer is to increment his points by 1 after each purchase. However, an intelligent customer would like to achieve the Jackpot score in the minimum number of purchases. Even still, for a single customer, the number of weeks in which he gets the Jackpot will be equal to the number of purchases, since only the first purchase in a week qualifies towards upgrade of points. The most intelligent customer of all would partner with a friend and try to merge their points in the end. Of course this is better because this means that fewer weeks will be necessary to achieve the Jackpot. Alice and Bob are going to use this strategy. They will decide a sub-target score for themselves (which may be different for each of them) and try to reach that sub-target in the fewest number of weeks (at the rate of one purchase per week). Once both of them reach that sub-target, they will merge their points to achieve Alice's Jackpot target! See the Explanation Section for clarification. Write a program that takes as input Alice's Jackpot score and outputs the minimum number of weeks Alice and Bob take to achieve the Jackpot score. Note that Alice and Bob will never merge their scores in between. They will only merge their scores once they reach the respective sub-targets they decide for themselves.  Input The first line of input contains the number T, the number of test case. Each test case contains a single integer N, Alice's Jackpot target.  Output For each test case, output a single line containing the number W, the minimum number of weeks necessary for Alice and Bob to achieve Alice's Jackpot target.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 1000 2 ≤ N ≤ 1000000000   Sample Input  4 2 4 10 55   Sample Output  0 1 3 6   Explanation In the first example, Alice and Bob have already reached the target. In the second example, they both choose the sub-target 2 and achieve it in 1 week by making one purchase each. Their merged score then becomes equal to 4. In the last example, Alice chooses to reach 8 and Bob chooses to reach 2. Alice can reach 8 in 3 weeks and Bob reaches 2 in 1 week. Thus, they achieve their target 10, in 3 weeks (bottlenecked on Alice). There are more ways to split the target to still achieve it in 3 weeks, but there is no way to split the target among them to achieve it in 2 weeks. Hence, the answer is 3. In the last test case, Alice and Bob can split the target as 36 and 19. 36 can be achieved Alice in 6 purchases (or weeks). 19 can be achieved by Bob in 6 purchases (or weeks). Hence, the answer is 6. Of course there are other ways, but there is no way that can achieve this in fewer than 6 weeks. 
  A cricket match is going on between India and South-Africa. Currently AB de Villiers is batting and team India is bowling. AB de Villiers hits a ball hard and goes high up in the air but is not able to cover the boundary. The spot where the ball is going to fall is the point P1 in the field which has the coordinates  (x1,y1) (where x1 and y1 are integers). When the batsman hit the ball, Sir Ravindra Jadeja was the one closest to the point P1  on the ground and was initially standing at the point P2 (x2,y2) (where x2 and y2 are integers). The secret behind the fast fielding of Sir Jadeja is that he moves towards his target by placing his steps at only those points that have integral coordinates. Now, Sir Jadeja starts moving towards the point P1 in order to take a catch. You are the cameraman shooting the entire trajectory of Sir Jadeja. You have to know the number of steps Sir Jadeja takes at locations (x,y) on the line segment between P1 and P2 (excluding P1 and P2) which satisfy the condition that both x and y are integers?     Input The first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. T lines follow. Each of the following T lines contains one test case each. Each test case contains 4 integers x1, y1, x2 and y2 separated by a single space.  Output A single line containing the number of steps.  Constraints 1 <= T <= 105 -10^9 <= x1, y1, x2, y2 <= 10^9  Example Input: 3 4 0 0 2 5 5 2 2 8 16 1 9  Output: 1 2 6    Explanation Between (4,0) and (0,2) there’s only 1 integral point (2,1) hence 1 step. 
Recently, Jack organized  a party where his N girlfriends came. Each of his girlfriend was wearing a colored dress and there are K different color dresses in total. For this party Jack hired a photographer who secretly took photos of his girlfriends. The next morning, Jack decided to upload some photos (as taken by photographer) on Facebook but he uploads only those photos which are "pretty" to gain more number of likes. A photo is said to be "pretty" if more than half of his girlfriends in it are wearing same colored dress. In other words, if there are G girlfriend in the photo, it is pretty if strictly more than G / 2 girlfriends have same colored dress. Write a program that will check for a set of M pictures if they are pretty, and which color is dominating if they are.  Input First line contains two integers N number of Girlfriends, K number of Colors. Second line contains N integers between 1 and K (inclusive) representing color of dresses, ordered the way girlfriends came into the party. Third line contains M, number of pictures.

 Ashvant is a cool guy with lot of girlfriends. Since valentines day is nearing he wishes to visit one of his girlfriends who is currently at a different city. So he decides to travel by bus and in meantime he was thinking about gifting her. He thought of gifting something unique. He had THREE types of very rare stones(type1, type2, type3). He had many stones in each type. These are very rare stones and his girlfriend really likes these kind of gifts :P So he decides to make RINGS with these stones placing them at the centre of the ring. He makes rings based on the following conditions 1) three stones of type1 makes the center of the ring 2) three stones of type2 makes the center of the ring 3) three stones of type3 makes the center of the ring 4) a stone from type1, a stone from type2 and a stone from type3 makes the center of the ring(i.e single stone from each type gives 3 stones in total which makes the center of the ring) No other combinations will be considered for making the center of the ring. Ashvant is very busy so he asks you to make the maximum number of rings from these three types of stones given to you.   Input  First line contains the number of testcases, T (1<=T<=10) Following T lines (ith line describes ith testcase) contains three numbers each(t1, t2, t3) each describing the number of stones in each type. (0 <= t1,t2,t3 <= 10^9)   Output  Print T lines (ith line corresponding to ith testcase)containing the maximum number of rings that can be made from given number of stones in each type.

Dipu's hard disk crashed last week. He bought a new one and has already installed all necessary software. But he has lost his personal collection of media files. It is just unbearable! How can he avoid such a loss in future?   Dipu is planning to maintain a "fresh" second hard disk in his computer as a backup device. He wants to make sure that the backup hard disk is never too old, by replacing it with a new one every few months. This is what he will do: after a backup hard disk has been used for a few months, Dipu will buy a new hard disk, move all the data from the old backup disk to the new one and then sell the old one. He knows that he will have to sell an old backup disk at a price lower than its original price because of both depreciation and the drop in the market price of new hard disks. His goal is to keep the total cost of maintaining the backups as low as possible.   Given the prices of different models of hard disks in the next few months, your job is to determine the minimum cost of maintaining the backup disks in the same period of time. Assume:  Dipu will only buy a new backup hard disk and sell the old one on the first day of a month. He has no backup disk to sell on the first day of the first month. So he needs to buy a new backup disk on the first day of the first month, without selling. The amount he will get by selling a hard disk is exactly Tk 100 less than the current price of a new hard disk of the same model at the selling time. the price of same model hard disks never goes up versus months, and always remains expensive than Tk 100.   Input Input consists of several datasets. Each dataset consists of the followings: Tips:  A line containing the name of the set. A line containing 2 positive integers n and m, denoting respectively the number of different models of hard disks and the number of months to consider. Each of next n lines contains the description of one hard disk. The description of a hard disk consists of its model name followed by m integers denoting its price on the first day of the m months in order.   The end of input is marked with a line consisting of "TheEnd" (quotes for clarification). All data on a single line are separated by exactly one space.  Output For each set of input, the output should contain the name of the set on the first line first. On the second line, output the minimum possible cost. Then, list several lines of hard disks used in those m months, in the order of their use (maybe less than m disks are used). For each hard disk, its name should be followed by the number of month(s) it will be used. At the end of each set, print an empty line.  If there are multiple possibilities, any one of them is acceptable.  The end of output should be marked with a line consisting of "TheEnd" (quotes for clarification).  See the sample output for details.   Constraints 1 < n < 100, 1 < m < 200  The prices are below Tk 20,000 and non-increasing in the same line.  The name of sets and the name of a hard disk consist of 2 to 16 alphanumeric characters.

John lives in a hilly city. He wants to go from point A to point B and he is planning to walk today. Fortunately for him, the city is designed like a grid. Unfortunately, as the elevation of each point is different, finding the easiest path is not trivial. That’s why John needs your help.  John wants to find a path from A to B with minimum hardness. Hardness of going from point A with height h_1 to adjacent point B with height h_2 is    if h_1 > h_2, then 0.5 + 0.5 * sqrt(1 + (h_1 - h_2 )^2)  otherwise, -0.5 + 1.5 * sqrt(1 + (h_1 - h_2 )^2)   Distance between adjacent points is considered one unit. Slope of road segments between adjacent points is never more than 0.5.   Input The input file starts with a number T that represents the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case starts with two number r, c, representing the size of the grid. Next r lines contain c numbers. j-th number from i-th line corresponds to the height of the intersection of i-th street with j-th avenue.   Next line contains an integer q, then q lines follow. Each of the following lines represents a query. A query contains four numbers: i_s, j_s, i_e, and j_e. This represents a request to find the path with minimum hardness from intersection between i_s-th street and j_s-th avenue to the intersection between i_e-th street and j_e-th avenue.   Output  Start each test case with case number as shown in sample output (e.g. “Case 1:” for the first case, quotes for clarification). Then output q lines, each for one query. For each query, output a line containing the hardness of optimal path with 6 digits after decimal point.   See sample input and output in the next page for details.

In the land of Rhyme, the King and his people always speak in rhymes. They are so accustomed in conversing using rhymes that at one point it became monotonous. So what was once a source of happiness and amusement is now creating a strange emotion within the heart of the people. The productivity of the people has become less and more importantly, the happiness index of the land has plummeted. The experts have investigated the whole matter and reported that speaking in rhyme is not the problem; it is the monotony of the same thing that is affecting the people. In fact they suggested changing the definition of rhyme slightly. One of their recommendations is to introduce a new concept of "richness" in a sentence.  A sentence would be termed rich if it starts and ends with the same word! The King seems to like this definition. But he is finding it difficult to even say a simple meaningful sentence that is "rich".  The King became quite anxious. Your boss, King’s ICT adviser, suggested that a competition among the general people should be thrown where the participants would have to submit a piece (story/poem/essay etc.) full of rich sentences. Then the richest pieces would be judged and be awarded.  The King made a decree accordingly. Your boss was ordered to formulate a judging scheme for the pieces and write a program immediately to do the judgment. And as usual he formulated something and asked you to implement that. What he has asked you to do is as follows. You will take as input a piece as a character array. And output another array where each position will give the richness of the piece up to that position.  “What is richness?” You asked.  Your boss replied, “The richness is the size of the identical proper substring which is present at the beginning and at the end of the piece. But, the complete string cannot be considered as its substring.”  “But you said to calculate the richness at each position”! You inquired.  “Yes, of course! When you calculate up to a position, you will have to assume that the piece ends at that position.” Your boss smiled. He seemed to be quite happy in formulating this.  You asked again, "Don't I need to think about the word boundaries?"  “Not now, my son. We will think about it later. Do it without considering word boundaries for now. You will consider the input character by character”. He assured you. He seemed all the more content with his own formulation and probably was not seeing the possible pitfalls. He continued, "And one other point; richness of the first position would always be 0."  Meaningful, you thought. But you had to ask a final question. “How would you then finally compute the richness of the total piece using all these information? What will be the formula?”  Your boss seemed perplexed. He did not think this through, as it seemed. So, he said, “You need not worry about that. Do as I said. Just remember that the input size could be quite large.”  You knew that you have to stop asking and start coding now. “Yes, boss!” you said. You also realized the implication of the last direction of your boss. Few years back there was another competition on literary works. And the size of some pieces was 4 million characters!   Input Input consists of several lines. Each line contains a string of lowercase English letters. End of input is indicated by a line containing the string “End”. No output line should be produced for this line.   Output For each input line, you must output a line containing several integers, separated by space. The number of integers must be same as the length of the input string. The Integer at a specific position must represent the richness of the input string up to that position. There must not be any trailing space in any output line.

Alice and Bob have got some chocolates as a gift. There are 2 types of chocolates. Some chocolates have the shape of a sphere and some chocolates have the shape of a stick. Each chocolate stick connects a pair of chocolate sphere. They want to divide these chocolates and they seek your help. They want all of the chocolate spheres for themselves. Alice loves chocolate sticks. For all of the chocolate spheres she gets, each pair of them should be connected by a stick. Bob dislikes chocolate sticks. For all of the chocolate spheres he gets, no pair of them should be connected by a stick. To be clear, if any two chocolate spheres are connected by a chocolate stick initially he will take at most one of them but not both. They do not care about the sticks that connect a sphere of Alice and a sphere of Bob. You can choose to eat them. Given the description of the chocolate spheres and chocolate sticks, determine if you can divide those chocolate spheres among Alice and Bob, satisfying both of their preferences.  Input  First line of the input contains T, the number of test cases. Each test case starts with 2 integers N and M. N is the number of chocolate spheres (The chocolate spheres are numbered from 1 to N) and M is the number of chocolate sticks connecting them.

In olden days, when primary memory was not as available as it is now, files were stored in external storage devices like tapes, and then two files or their parts were loaded in memory for merging. In merging two sorted files, in the worst case, number of comparisons required equals sum of lengths of the two files. Assume in K-way merging the number of comparisons equals sum of lengths of files to be merged. Given length of a set of files you are required to find order in which these files will have to be merged in minimum number of comparisons.  Input The first line of input is an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. From the next line, test cases follow. For each case, the first line contains two integers, N and K, representing respectively number of files to be merged and maximum number of files that can be merged at the same time. Next line contains N positive integers representing the length of each file.   Output For each test case, you must print a single line with the test case number and the minimum number of comparisons incurred to merge the files.

The first line of each test case will contain 2 integers N and M denoting respectively the number of denomination values and the number of scenarios on that test case. Next line will contain the N denominations. Note that, a denomination can be either an integer x or a fractional number y, with exactly 2 digits after the decimal point and a zero (0) before the decimal point. It is guaranteed that there will always be a denomination of value 1 and 0.01. Then there will be M numbers in the next line. Each of these numbers z can either be an integer or a decimal number with exactly 2 digits after the decimal point (i.e. 100.50, 55.01).

Tower of Hanoi problem is a classical recurrence problem that is often used to teach recurrence relations to computer science students. In the classical 3-Peg Tower of Hanoi problem initially the peg A contains all disks top to bottom in a strictly small to big order. This tower of disks is to be moved to peg C using peg B as intermediate. The rule of the game is that in every move the top disk from one of the towers can be moved to the top of another tower. Never ever can we put a large disk on top of a smaller one. In this problem, in order to move a tower of n disks, we must shift the top sub-tower of n - 1 disks to the only intermediate peg, then shift the largest to peg C and then the sub-tower of size n - 1 from intermediate to destination peg. Whatever the value of n may be exactly n - 1 disks have to be shifted to the only intermediate peg. We have no choice of fewer or more disks, and no choice for the intermediate peg. In multi-Peg Tower of Hanoi problem we have p ≥ 3 pegs (P1, P2, ..., Pp) and n disks to move from P1 to Pp using minimum number of moves. We refer to this as (n, p) system. Now we have p - 2 intermediate pegs and not all of n - 1 disks need to be shifted to one intermediate peg. However, before the largest disk moves to the destination peg, all top n - 1 disks have to be distributed among all intermediate pegs. While the optimal strategy still baffles algorithm designers, many believe that in the optimal solution, certain optimal number n1 disks have to be shifted to an intermediate peg. Then the remaining n - n1 disks must reach destination, while the disks in the intermediate peg will remain untouched. Then the disks in the intermediate peg must reach destination. In transferring any sub-tower to any peg, this strategy will be followed recursively. Let M(n, p) be the minimum number of moves required to shift a tower of n disks in p peg system. This strategy satisfies the following recurrence relations: M(n,p) = min(2M(n1,p)+M(n-n1,p-1)) for all 0 < n1 < n.   Assume further that, if multiple strategies result in minimum number of moves, then the strategy for which n1 is the smallest is chosen. Your job is to find out the move number at which a particular disk D moves ultimately to the destination peg in an (n, p) system.   Input The first line of input will be an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Each test case is represented by a triple of integers N, P and K in the same line separated by space. N denotes the number of disks. P denotes the number of pegs. K denotes the index (1-based from the top) of the disk, whose move number need to be found out.  Output For each test case, there should be a single line of output. The line should contain “Case : ”, followed by an integer representing the move number at which disk K moves ultimately to the destination peg.

The King of France has turned old. He would like one of his three sons to take up his place as the next King. But he doesn’t want them to fight over the throne after his death. Over so many years in the past, his sons have been fighting with each other over trifles. But he feels that deep inside their hearts, the three brothers love each other. The King believes that he can bring back the love and harmony among his sons which was present in their childhood. He has asked Leonardo to help him accomplish this task so that his sons cherish their relationship again. So, Leonardo has come up with a game that will force all three of them to play together. The factory, just on the boundary of the kingdom, produces special kind of gold chips. Each gold chip is inscribed with a lowercase letter of the English alphabet, called its nameLetter. There is also a unique integer called aurumNumber associated with each gold chip which is inscribed on the other side of the gold chip. These chips also have special grooves on their ends which can be used to attach gold chips one after the other and make a long solid linear chain out of them. On Leonardo’s advice the King has decided to call all his 3 sons for a small collective exer cise. Leonardo has made three chains A, B and C containing the same number of gold chips. The gold chips in each of these chains are arranged in the increasing order of their aurumNum bers. Leonardo gives a chain to each of the sons. The task given to the sons is that each of them has to create a chain, for which he may remove some of the gold chips from his chain. It is necessary that all the three new chains thus created must have the same nameLetters when read from left to right. All the removed gold chips will be donated for charity. Each new gold chain must also have the gold chips arranged in the increasing order of their aurumNumber. If the sons succeed in doing this, they get to keep the gold chain with themselves. They must donate the entire chain with all of the gold chips for charity if they fail to create such chains. All of the three sons are very greedy and therefore they want to remove the minimum number of gold chips from their respective gold chains. You have to find out that what is the minimum number of total gold chips that the three sons have to donate in order to complete this exercise successfully.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T which is the number of test cases to follow. Starting from the next line, each test case consists of three strings A, B and C in separate lines. Each of these strings is the sequence of nameLetters in the order of the gold chips (which are arranged in the increasing order of their aurumNumber) in the gold chain.    Output For each of the test cases, print the minimum number of total gold chips which the three sons will have to donate for charity.    Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 13 1 ≤ |A|, |B|, |C| ≤ 450 |A| = |B| = |C| Here, |A| denotes the length of a string A. Similarly |B| for B and |C| for C.     Sample Input: 2 acmicpc acmicpd acdicpc aab aba abb  Output: 6 3    Explanation Case 1: The gold chips donated by the first son are ‘m’ and ‘c’. The second son donates ‘m’ and ‘d’ and the third son donates ‘d’ and ‘c’. This leaves “acicp” as the nameLetters on the gold chains they create Case 2: The gold chips donated by the sons are ‘a’, ‘a’ and ‘b’, respectively. This leaves each of them with “ab”. 
The capital city of the kingdom of France has a lot of tribal clans living in the outskirts. Farming and hunting are the two major occupations of these people. These clans keep moving around the kingdom and make their homes using wood and leaves. Each clan has a different culture and in general people of one clan do not like people from the other clans. They live separately and have intra-clan weddings only. With the advent of the new season, there are floods coming in from the Seine River. As these people don’t have proper houses to live in, they have requested the King to provide shel- ter in the well protected capital city. The King has decided to construct temporary houses for these clans in the Great Royal Circle which is a circle in shape. As these clans do not like each other, they can’t live together and would need some kind of a boundary to separate their shelters. The King has come up with a plan to do so. He decided that a number of bamboo sticks will be placed on the boundary of the Great Royal Circle. Then for every pair of bamboo sticks a wired fence will be used to connect them and create partitions of the circle. The bamboo sticks will be placed such that no three fences cross at the same point within the circle. Proper joints are placed at locations where two fences cross each other. In this way, the Great Royal Circle is divided into a number of regions each of which will be given to a clan to live in temporarily. As there is a shortage of dry bamboo sticks, the King’s soldiers could only manage N bamboo sticks to be placed on the boundary of the Great Royal Circle. What is the maximum number of different clans the King can provide shelter to?    Input The first line of the input contains an integer T which is the number of test cases. Next follow T lines each containing an integer N, the number of bamboo sticks available.    Output For each test case, output in a separate line the maximum number of clans which can be provided shelter from the floods. Since this number can be very big, output it modulo 1000000007.    Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 30000 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^9     Example Input: 4 2 3 4 5  Output: 2 4 8 16 
Leonardo Da Vinci has entered a fort which has N catacombs numbered from 1 to N . A cat- acomb is an underground cemetery consisting of a subterranean gallery. His aim is to destroy each of the N catacombs, as quickly as possible. The catacombs have a special structure. The catacombs are built in layers, with exactly one catacomb (numbered 1) in the topmost layer (layer number 1). If a catacomb is in the i^th layer, it will have exactly one passage to one of the catacombs in the (i − 1)^th layer. Also, from each catacomb, there is exactly one way out, which is to keep going to the above layers till you reach the top layer. In graph theory terms, the catacombs structure is a tree rooted at vertex number 1. Just before he was going to destroy the catacombs, his apprentice sent him a few messages with the information of the catacombs that have kids in them. Each message contains the number of the catacomb that has a kid inside it. Leonardo must not destroy any catacomb that would lead to a kid being trapped inside the fort. Leonardo has to find out how many catacombs he can destroy without trapping a kid inside.    Input First line contains a single integer T , denoting the number of testcases. Each testcase starts with a single integer N , denoting the number of catacombs. Each of the next N − 1 lines contains 2 numbers A and B indicating that there is a passage between catacomb number A and B. Next line contains M , the number of messages Leonardo got from his apprentice, followed by M lines each containing an integer indicating the number of the catacomb that has a kid inside it.    Output For each message, print the number of catacombs that Leonardo can destroy without trapping any of the kids mentioned so far in the messages.    Constraints Should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have. Format it like:  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ N, M ≤ 50000 1 ≤ A, B ≤ N     Sample Input: 1 2 1 2 2 2 1  Output: 0 0    Explanation The above system of catacombs have catacomb number 1 in layer 1 and catacomb number 2 in layer 2. First message says that there is an kid in catacomb 2. Hence none of the catacombs can be destroyed (else the kid gets trapped). In the second message, another kid is reported in catacomb 1. Still, none of the catacombs can be destroyed. Hence answer after each message is 0. 
Da Vinci is about to retire from the post of Prime Minister of the French King in a month. It is going to be very difficult for the King to find his replacement. The King is worried about the junior ministers as to how they will work without a leader. To instill in some values of team work among them, the King has asked all the N junior ministers to paint M walls together. The King feels that such a hands-on activity is a very good way to make the junior ministers come together and work as a team. The ministers are allowed to divide a wall into parts such that each part is painted by a different minister. No two ministers are allowed to paint the same wall at the same time. It can be assumed that all the ministers paint the wall at the same rate. As this is just a training exercise, ministers may have other important jobs as well and they may not be free all the time to do the painting work. S is the start time and E is the end time between which a minister is free to paint the walls. Also, we know that for a minister, painting is a mundane job. It may happen that a minister gets bored while painting a wall, leaves it in between and starts painting another wall without wasting any time. The minister may later come back to finish the previous wall or he may ask one of the other ministers who he is friends with to finish painting the wall. The King is really worried about the future of the kingdom which is going to have these min- isters without a leader. He really wants these ministers to make smart decisions and perform well in any situation that they may face. Thus, he has decided to put some extra constraints on the wall painting exercise. The King knows the number of man hours H required for a wall to get painted completely. So, for each wall he has decided a duration with the start time A and the end time D during which the ministers should start and finish painting the wall. As anxious the King is about testing his ministers, he is also worried that a failure in com- pleting the task may harm their confidence. He wants to know whether his junior ministers would be able to finish the given task and meet the deadlines or not. You need to help the King to find this out.    Input The first line of the input contains an integer T which is the number of test cases to follow. The first line of each test case consists of two space separated integers N and M . Each of the next N lines contains two space separated integers S and E. Next M lines contain three space separated integers A, D and H each.    Output For each test case, output a separate line containing “YES” (quotes for clarity) if it is possible for the junior ministers to paint each of the walls during the designated time. Output “NO” (quotes for clarity) if it is not possible to do so.    Constraints Should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have. Format it like:  1 ≤ T ≤ 510 1 ≤ N,M ≤ 100 0 ≤ S,E,A,D,H ≤ 10^7     Example Input: 1 2 2 1 5 3 4 1 5 3 2 4 2  Output: YES    Explanation The first minister paints the first wall from time 1 − 2. Then he paints the second wall from time 2 − 3. Then he paints the first wall again from time 3 − 5. The second minister paints the second wall from time 3 − 4. Thus both the walls get painted fully. 
The King of Florence is going to visit Da Vinci in his workshop to see his paintings. In preparation of that, Da Vinci has painted a total of N paintings that he would display to the King. Since, the King is very busy dealing with the after effects of war, he has asked Da Vinci to make sure that he can see all of his paintings in one standing. To solve that problem, Da Vinci has done the following: He has manufactured N tables, each one of a different height. He plans to keep tables in a row and display a painting at the top of each table. This way, the King will be able to see all the paintings when he is standing in front of this row of tables. All the paintings are of equal height. This plan of Da Vinci was perfect but he received the news of another rebellion in Florence. He knows that since King has promised to see Da Vinci’s work, he won’t back down. Da Vinci does not want to hold the King for too long and now has decided that he will only show K of his paintings to the King. For that, he will re-arrange the tables so that the King can only see K of his paintings when he is standing at the front of the row. King can see a painting if there is no painting in front of it in the row, which is blocking King’s view. Da Vinci will not remove any tables, because if King decides that he wants to look at more of Da Vinci’s work, he wants to be able to show it without adding anymore delay. All of Da Vinci’s paintings are the best in the world, so he knows he can choose any of his K paintings to display to the King. Help Da Vinci in finding in how many ways he can arrange the table so that only K of his paintings are visible to the King.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T which is the number of test cases to follow. Then T lines follow, each containing two space separated integers N and K.    Output For each of the test cases, print the total number of ways Da Vinci can make them sit in a row. Since this number can be very large, output it modulo 1000000007.    Constraints Should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have. Format it like:  1 ≤ T ≤ 501501 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000 1 ≤ K ≤ 1000     Example Input: 3 2 1 2 2 4 2  Output: 1 1 11   
   Da Vinci was once wandering on the roads of Florence when he found a child playing with a binary string L. He was delighted to see that a small child was showing interest in the beautiful world of binary strings. To further interest the child and to make sure that the child keeps on playing with binary strings, he gave the child a task: Each day the child has to now play with the binary string that comes lexicographically after the string that he was playing with on the previous day. He promised the child that whenever he visits back, he will ask him the string that he should be playing with. If the child gets the correct string, he will recieve a reward from Da Vinci, and may be Da Vinci will take him as his student. Help the child to find what string he should be playing with on the day Da Vinci visits him back.  Input  First line contains T, the number of testcases. It is followed by 2T lines, 2 lines per testcase. First line of each testcase starts with a binary string L. Second line contains a single integer K, number of days after which Da Vinci visits the child. The binary string has no leading zeroes, e.g., 0111 has a 0 in the leading (first) position, and such strings will not be there in the input.   Output  For each testcase, output one line containing the required answer. The output string should not have leading zeroes.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 1000 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^18   Example Input: 2 1001 1 1000 3  Output: 1010 1011  
  War is inevitable now that the King has refused to fulfill the demands of the enemy neighbour. The King has sought Da Vinci's help in devising a strategy to not lose to the barbarous enemy neighbour. Leonardo assured him that he can produce chemical explosives (yes chemical explosives!! Leonardo has always been generations ahead of the people) which have the potential to destroy the enemy army within seconds. The chemical explosives need to be handled with care. Leonardo has developed K different types of explosives. He has a very large number of explosives of each type so that there is no shortage during war. Most of these explosives are kept far from the city in Leonardo's lab among the mountains near the Sienne river. The King suspects an attack in a few days and he wants some explosives to be stored near the palace. Leonardo knows that storing these explosives in the city can be quite dangerous. But due to the urgent requirements put up during this war, he has to bring some of the explosives in the city. Leonardo thinks that the dungeons is the safest place inside the city to store these explosives. There are two major pathways A and B inside the dungeons which run parallel to each other and are 1 metre apart. There are N cross pathways which intersect A and B perpendicularly. These N cross pathways are spread evenly over the lengths of A and B with the adjacent cross pathways being 1 metre apart from each other. Each cross pathway intersects with both the major pathways A and B. The point of intersection of a pathway and a cross pathway is called a junction point. In this way, there are J(= 2N) junction points inside the dungeons. See the figure below to have a clear picture of the structure of the dungeons.  The explosives made by Leonardo are made of a special infammable material. For safety puroses, explosives of the same type have to be placed at least √2 metres apart, otherwise they will explode. Whereas, the explosives of different types need to be placed only 1 metre apart to prevent their self explosion. Leonardo plans on putting these explosives at the junction points only. He doesn't want any of the explosives to explode on its own and thus wants to keep them at adequate distance from each other. It is not necessary to bring every type of explosive from the lab among the mountains. Leonardo will only bring those explosives which he can arrange safely. Your task is to figure out the number of ways in which it is safe to arrange 2N explosives on the junction points.  Input  Input contains a number of test cases. The first line of input contains an integer T. Next T lines follow, each containing two space separated integers N and K.   Output  For each test case, output in a separate line the total number of ways in which Leonardo can arrange the explosives. The answer can be very big so output it modulo 1000000007.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 60000 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^18 2 ≤ K ≤ 10^9   Example Input: 3 1 2 1 3 2 4  Output: 2 6 84  
  The Second Italian War of 1499 has started and the French troops have attacked Milan. Leonardo Da Vinci is worried for the safety of his diary where he keeps the secrets of all his creations. He would never want that diary to get into the hands of the French King. For this, he creates a special box which can only be opened if you enter a special key K. K is an N - 1 length string containing only lowercase letters of the English alphabet. But when Leonardo was putting his diary into the box and was about to lock it with the key, the French soldiers walk in. They saw the key entered by Leonardo and have taken him captive and have possession of the box.  But when Leonardo was putting his diary into the box and was about to lock it with the key, the French soldiers walk in. They saw the key entered by Leonardo and have taken him captive and have possession of the box. But knowing the reputation of Leonardo, they are being cautious and have captured one of Leonardo's apprentices to gather more information on how to open the box. The apprentice (after torture) provided them with the following information:  Leonardo has made the box in such a way that you could lock it by entering any N length string L of lowercase letters such that removing exactly one letter from L gives K, the string that will unlock the box. The soldiers have seen Leonardo entering N in the box. If they enter a wrong key, the contents of the box will be destroyed by an acidic substance hidden inside the box. It may happen that the box is rigged to hurt the person trying to open the box, by possibly throwing some acidic substance over his hands.   The soldiers have now decided not to take the risk of getting acid burns and have forced the apprentice to open the box on the condition that his life will be spared only if he opens the box without damage. The apprentice fearing for his life, has entered a string K as the unlock pattern.   Given the two strings L and K, the one entered by Leonardo, and the one entered by the apprentice respectively, can you tell whether Leonardo's secrets will be uncovered or not?   Input  The first line contains an integer T which is the number of test cases to solve. It is followed by 2T lines containing the test cases. Each test case consists of 2 strings L and K, respectively in separate lines.   Output  For each test case print the output in a separate line. If Leonardo's secrets are now in hands of French soldier, print 1 otherwise 0.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ N ≤ 20000   Example Input: 5 acmicpc acicpc acmicpc acmicp acmicpc cmicpc acmicpc acmcpi acmicpc cmicpa  Output: 1 1 1 0 0  
  Define function F on set of positive integers as  A positive integer n is called an "identity integer" if F(n) = {n}. Given multiple queries, each consisting of a single integer K, find the K^th "identity integer".  Input  First line contains a single integer Q, denoting the number of queries. Q lines follow, each containing a single integer K.   Output  For each query, print a single integer, the K^th "identity integer" modulo 1000000007.   Constraints  1 ≤ Q, K ≤ 200000   Example Input: 1 1  Output: 4  
 Points:10 The Indian Heights School believes that learning with the aid of technology is the fastest way to do so. It is a pioneer in innovation and virtual classrooms in the country. Keeping in accordance with its practices, the school wants to integrate software and automate various functions at the classroom level. As college students, your team volunteered for this assignment and your proposal has been accepted by the school's director. Each day the class teacher picks a random number of students to delegate them duties for the day such as wiping the board, managing the class, maintaining the display boards and so on. But sometimes the students complain about being picked more frequently than the others.  Thus the teacher wants to know the number of ways to pick a certain number of students out of the total class. Your job is to help her do so...    Input:  The first line consists of total no of test cases. Each test case consists of one line containing two integers(space separated) a ≥ 1(i.e. total students) and 0 ≤ b ≤ a (i.e. number of students to be picked).   Output:  For each test case, print one line containing the required number. This number will always fit into an integer, i.e. it will be less than 2^31.    Example: Input:  2 5 3 10 5    Output:  10 252 
 Points:15 The Environmental Protection Agency is a billion dollar organisation that works to protect the environment from hazardous changes worldwide. It is funded by the national governments, charitable organisations, business donations as well as its own earnings. To evaluate the ground realities of the theory of global warming, the agency is developing a climate prediction prototype model that will simulate the climate given some parameters as well as predict climatic conditions worldwide. All data and parameters sent to this model in the form of Boolean matrices. Thus instead of processing single parameters one at a time, the model instead operates on multiple boolean matrices of similar parameters at the same time. This is a revolutionary new paradigm, but requires some testing and validation before it can be announced. Despite the exciting nature of this approach, it has a limitation. It can only process those Boolean matrices in which the sum of every row and every column evaluates to an even number. This is why you have been brought in. Given any Boolean matrix, you need to determine if it can be transformed into the required format by changing at most one value in the matrix, and if that is not possible then classify the matrix as corrupt for if we change more than one value, then the error will be too large to successfully predict the ever changing climate.    Input:  The first line consists of total no of test cases. The first line of each test case contains one integer n (n  Output:  For each matrix in the input file, print one line. If the matrix already has the sum of all rows and all columns evaluating to an even number, print 1. If it can be made to do so by changing one bit, print (i,j) where i is the row and j the column of the bit to be changed. Otherwise, print 0 to signify a corrupt matrix.    Example: Input:  3 4 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 4 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 4 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1    Output:  1 (2,3) 0 
 Points:15 Work's on at full flow at the Indian National Security Autonomous Force, known as INSAF in short. Few know that employees of this particular agency are amongst the highest paid in the country. In the digital age of today, information is power and everything must be done to secure it. This force does not entertain any job applications take out any ads in the public, instead it recruits its workforce by handpicking them from different professions in the country. That was exactly how you were recruited, and now you're a part of an elite team working on creating mutating encryption algorithms for secure transmission of sensitive data. You have been given the task of generating an algorithm for transmission of numerical values. For a given non negative integer number N, you must generate a code to find the minimal natural number Q such that the product of all digit s in Q is equal to N.   Input:  The first line will consist of the one number of test cases T. The next T lines will consist of one string of a non negative number N.   Output:  For each test case, output is a number Q,that will form the number by mutliplying each digits. Print '-10' if no such number exists.    Example: Input: 3 1 10 123456789    Output: 1 25 -10 
Points:10  Very long ago a group of scholars formed a secret society by the name of Brotherhood of Brom. They went underground so that they could  continue their scientific research away from the eyes of the church that demanded confinement of all scientific pursuits, for the church  saw them as acts of devilry brought upon by curiosity. Scientists were often rounded up in the name of being evil witches and wizards and  burnt at the stake...or sometimes killed by the church assassins. To maintain their secrecy, the Brotherhood of Brom used passwords.  However they did not sick to a single password, instead they used mirrored palindromes. The more the number of such words a member could  come up with, the more intelligent he seemed to be... A regular palindrome is a string of numbers or letters that is the same forward as backward. For example, the string "ABCDEDCBA" is a  palindrome because it is the same when the string is read from left to right as when the string is read from right to left. A mirrored string is a string for which when each of the elements of the string is changed to its reverse (if it has a reverse) and the  string is read backwards the result is the same as the original string. For example, the string "3AIAE" is a mirrored string because "A"  and "I" are their own reverses, and "3" and "E" are each others' reverses. A mirrored palindrome is a string that meets the criteria of a regular palindrome and the criteria of a mirrored string. The string  "ATOYOTA" is a mirrored palindrome because if the string is read backwards, the string is the same as the original and because if each of  the characters is replaced by its reverse and the result is read backwards, the result is the same as the original string. Of course, "A",  "T", "O", and "Y" are all their own reverses. A list of all valid characters and their reverses is as follows.  Char   Rev    Char     Rev    Char   Reverse A 		A 	M 		M 	Y 		Y B 			N	 		Z	 	5 C	 		O	 	O	1	 	1 D	 		P	 		2	 	S E 		3	Q		        3	 	E F	 		R	 		4 G	 		S	 	2 	5	 	Z H	 	H 	T	 	T	6 I	 	I	U	 	U	7 J	 	L	V	 	V	8	 	8 K 		W	W	 	        9 L	 	J 	X	 	X    *Note* that O (zero) and 0 (the letter) are considered the same characterand therefore *ONLY* the letter "0" is a valid character.It turns out that your great great great great grandfather was a member of this society. Wishing to emulate their genius, you want to use the same passwords for your lan gaming events in the modern day. You must design a program that checks whether a given string can act as password or not.   Input:  Input consists of strings (one per line) each of which will consist  valid characters(  Output:    Output will be a string: "notpalindrome" --if the string is not a palindrome and is not a mirrored string "regularpalindrome"-- if the string is a palindrome and is not a mirrored string "mirroredstring" --if the string is not a palindrome and is a mirrored string "mirroredpalindrome"-- if the string is a palindrome and is a mirrored string    Example:   Input:  NOTAPALINDROME ISAPALINILAPASI 2A3MEAS ATOYOTA #   Output:  notpalindrome regularpalindrome mirroredstring mirroredpalindrome   
Points:10 Your college teacher was highly impressed by your previous achievement. So now he has given you a new project to work on. If you can make this one into a success, you could be on your way to Rio de Janeiro in Brazil to participate in the global finale of this international technical extravaganza sponsored by Bromhood Brothers, a leading software developer( Now why does it look familiar ?!?). You are given  set of letters, and the challenge is to find how many different words can be made from these letters. This problem is designed to take all the fun out of it by automating the process.      Input: Input will be in two parts. The first part will be a dictionary of less than 1000 lines, containing words to be searched for. Each line will contain one word of up to 7 characters. Each word will be in lower case. The words will be in alphabetical order. The end of the dictionary will be indicated by a line consisting of a single `#' character.   After the dictionary there will be data for several word puzzles, each on a separate line. Each puzzle line will have from one to 7 lower case letters, separated by one or more spaces. Your task is to arrange some or all of these letters to form words in the dictionary. The list of puzzles will be terminated by a line consisting of a single `#'.     Output:     For each puzzle line in the input, a single line of output should be produced, containing the number of different words in the dictionary that can be formed using the letters in the puzzle line.  Note that each letter may be used only as many times as it appears in the puzzle line. For instance, the puzzle line `u l l' may produce the word `lul' but not the word `lull'.     Example: Input:  ant bee cat dog ewe fly gnu # b e w b b e e w w t a n c u g d #   Output:  0 2 3   
Points:10  The greatest enemies of the Brotherhood of Brom in their days were the Templar Knights, a band of highly skilled assassins originally established in 1118 to protect pilgrims and the Holy Sepulcher. Like the Brotherhood’s game of testing each other’s wits, the Knights too had a game of their own. The game was played on a board with squares arranged on rows and columns. The pieces used in the game attacked  pieces that were  either (a) two rows and one column away from its position, or (b) one row and two columns away from its position. This is exactly the nature of the problem you have been presented with at the finals of the global race in Rio de Janeiro. I n order to develop an unbeatable algorithm for the game, you are to determine the largest number of game pieces  that can be placed on a board with M rows and N columns so that no piece is attacking any other. M and N will each be no larger than 500.   Input The first line of input consists of no of test cases T(<100).The next T lines consist of  pairs of integers giving values for M and N.(M,N<=500)   Output For each input pair, display  the number of pieces that can be appropriately placed.   Example  Input:  3 2 3 5 5 4 7   Output:  4 13 14 
You are given N integers, denoted by A1, A2, … , AN Now you are given Q queries, each of whom is of following two types: Type 1: 1 L R: Print the no. of trailing zeros (zeros in the end) in the multiplication of no.s in range [L,R] of array ‘A’, i.e. no. of zeros in AL * AL+1 * … * AR Type 2: 2 L R V: Multiply the all the numbers in range [L,R] with V.   Input: First line contains a single integer T, number of test cases. Each test begins with a single line containing 2 space separated integers: N and Q, the no. of elements in the array and no. of queries. Next line contains N space-separated integers Ai Next Q lines describe one query each and can be one of the two types: 1) “1 L R”: Print no. of trailing zeros in multiplication of all no.s in range [L,R] of array ‘A’ 2) “2 L R V”: Multiply all no.s in range [L,R] with V   Output: For every test case, print the required answer for each query of type 2.   Constraints: 1<=T<=10 1<=N<=10^5 1<=Q<=10^5 1<=Ai,V<=2000 1<=L,R<=N   Example:   Input: 1 6 3 15 40 36 4 30 25 1 1 4 2 4 5 25 1 1 4    Output: 2 4    Explanation: In first query, Multiplication of no.s in range [1,4] = 15*40*36*4 = 86400. Trailing Zeros in 86400 = 2 In second query, Multiply all no.s in range [4,5] with 25. Array after multiplication: 15 40 36 100 750 25 In third query, Multiplication of no.s in range [1,4] = 15*40*36*100 = 2160000. Trailing Zeros in 2160000 = 4 
  Find the fastest way to type a word, given the word. You can skip total of T letters. Time needed to write a letter is given in an array with 26 integers depicting the time needed to type the alphabets. Index 0 will represent a, 1 will represent b, 2 will represent c till 25 representing z. Print the fastest time needed to write the word, after skipping T letters. Note: Each letter must be treated distinctly, example, if word is aaa and you can skip 1 letter, then you should type aa and not skip all the a's.  Input Input description. Input will start will an integer N on newline representing the count of test case. Each case will contain a number T on a newline, representing total count of letters you can skip. Next line of each test case will contain 26 integers representing the array of time needed to write letters a to z. Next line of each test case will contain the word that you need to type.    Output For each test case print the desired outputs, each on a newline.    Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 10 1 ≤ Time needed for each letter ≤ 300 1 ≤ Length of word ≤ 10 1 ≤ T ≤ length of given  word     Example Input: 1 1 100 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 abac Output: 105   Explanation Example case 1. one a can be skipped, requiring time 105 to write the word. 
  You need to shuffle a series of numbers from 1 To T, inclusive. The numbers are in ascending order, you have to shuffle them using bubble sort algorithm, that is swap every time a number is greater than another in the given list in the input. A number is greater than another in the list if the number appears later than the other in the list, check example for more clarity. Print the count of swaps done while you run the algorithm to shuffle them.  Following is the bubble sort algorithm procedure bubbleSort( A : list of items )      n = length(A)-1      for j=0 to n inclusive do         for i = 0 to n-1 inclusive do            /* if this pair is out of order */            if A[i] > A[i+1] then               /* swap them and remember something changed */               swap( A[i], A[i+1] )            end if         end for      end for     end procedure  Input Input description. Input will start will an integer N on newline representing the count of test case. Each case will contain a number T on a newline, representing total count of numbers. Next line of each test case will contain T integers representing the final shuffled series of numbers.    Output For each test case print the desired output, each on a newline.    Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 10 1 ≤ N ≤ 20     Example Input: 1 3 2 1 3 abac Output: 1   Explanation Example case 1. One swap between 1 and 2, because 1 appears later than 2, so 1 is greater than 2. 
   You will be given a tree represented by a matrix. The jth character of ith row will be 1 if there is a path from node i to j. You will also be given two integers N and F. N is the number of nodes in the tree and F(0 based index) is the node to which you need to find the distance from the root node. Root node will always be 0. Print the distance of the node F from the root.     Input First line will contain an integer T, the count of test cases. Each test case will start with two space separated integers, N and F, in a newline. N lines will follow each of length N. Each character of these lines will be either 0 or 1.    Output Output must contain T lines, each having the distance of the node F from root node 0 for each tree.    Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ N ≤ 10 0 ≤ F ≤ 9 , F is 0 based index.     Example Input: 2 1 0 0 9 6 011000000 000111000 000000111 000000000 000000000 000000000 000000000 000000000 000000000  Output: 0 2    Explanation Example case 1. Since there is only one node which is the root the distance is 0 Example case 2. Path to node 6 is 0->2->6, thus distance is 2. 
A district in a state has K villages (numbered from 1 to K). In order to provide better road connectivity in the district, the government has connected all the villages with two-lane paved roads, However, to reduce costs, the roads are constructed such that while it is possible to go from any village to any other village using the paved roads, there is exactly one route between any two villages. In addition, M of these villages are also connected to the district headquarter directly using two-lane roads. Elections are round the corner and a leader of a political party wishes to hold road shows in the villages. Since he does not have time to visit all the villages, he decides to go from the district headquarter to one of the villages that is connected to it, and then follow a path using the roads between the villages only, holding one road show at each village in the path as and when he reaches that village. Since he has to return to the district headquarter, he wishes to hold the last road show in a village that is again connected to the district headquarter. To save time, he also does not want to go through any village more than once. Obviously, he cannot go through all the villages. To ensure that people in other villages (not on the path) are not deterred from coming to his road shows, he asks his assistant to chalk a route such that the sum total of the distances of any village from its closest village in the path is  minimized. The road show being still a week off, he asks his assistant to take all the time he wants, but make sure that he finds the correct path. The assistant sets off to do this, trying to write a program to try out one-by-one all the different paths the leader can take and calculating the total distances people have to travel if a person in a village goes to the road show nearest to his village. Help him write this program.  Input The first line contains the number of test cases N. For each test case, the first line contains the number of villages K. This is followed by K lines, with the j-th line containing the information about village j.

It is almost Olympic time, but the organizers fear that the entire Olympic village will not be ready in time given the slow progress of construction. The games are going to have K events (numbered from 1 to K), and M countries (numbered from 1 to M) have already confirmed sending their sportspersons to participate in one or more of these events, with one person participating in exactly one event. Given the urgency of the situation, the organizers hold an emergency meeting to find the minimum number of total beds that they have to plan for counting all the rooms to accommodate all the people.  Given that there will be some moving in and moving out time, it was decided that two people will not be allotted the same bed if the days their events are held overlaps (including if one event starts on the same day the other ends). The organizers want to get that number and then want to speed up the work on a war-footing to at least get that many beds ready in time. You have to help them calculate this minimum.   Input The first line contains the number of test cases N. For each test case, the first line contains the values of K and M.

A real estate company undertakes to build a large township. The work is complex and requires the company to hire different categories of highly skilled laborers at different times for different parts of the work. An analysis of the whole project showed that K different groups of highly skilled laborers are needed for K subparts of the project, each of which takes a certain number of days.  The subparts are numbered from 1 to K. The whole work is supervised by a consultant of the company and he can supervise only one subpart at a time, so only one group of skilled laborers is actually utilized at one time. However, it is very difficult to find skilled labor just when you need them, so in order to avoid delays due to non-availability of required labor when it is needed, the company decides to hire all skilled laborers at the start of the project itself, paying them from the beginning of the project till their subpart is done, at which time, they are let go. Each such group costs the company a certain amount of money per day from the day they are hired till the day they finish their part. The situation is compounded by the fact that some of these subparts have to be done in order. However, it is seen that any subpart can be dependent on at most one other subpart and can cause at most one other subpart to be dependent on it. What is the minimum total amount the company has to pay to the laborers?  Input The first line contains the number of test cases N. For each test case, first line contains the number of subparts K. Second line contains a sequence of K integers indicating the number of days required to finish each subpart. Third line contains a sequence of K integers indicating the hiring cost per day for the labor group needed for each subpart. The fourth line contains an integer D indicating the number of pairs of subparts where one subpart is dependent on the other. This is followed by D lines, each of which contains two integers x and y (in that order), where subpart y depends on subpart x (i.e., y can start only after x has finished).  Output For each test case, print the case number, followed by a colon, followed by a single space, followed by a single integer indicating the total labor cost paid by the company.

A city has a road network with all roads arranged in a K x K square grid, with intersections  (total (K+1) x (K+1)) numbered as shown below (for an example 4 x 4 grid).    There are no one-way roads in the city now. For ease of movement of cars, the traffic department plans to convert all roads to one-way, while ensuring that any intersection can be reached from any other intersection. However, the fire brigade is located beside intersection A, and a set of factories with high fire risks are located in a set of intersections J. It is known that no intersection in J can be reached from A without making a turn somewhere, irrespective of which roads are made one-way or the route followed. The fire brigade has requested the traffic department to convert the roads to one-way in such a manner such that fire trucks starting from A can reach all of the intersections in J passing through the minimum total number of intersections possible to avoid delay. How should the traffic department decide which road to set which way?  Input The first line contains the number of test cases N. For each test case, the first line contains K, the dimension of the grid.

The third line contains the number of elements in J, followed by the intersection numbers of the elements in J.  Output For each test case, in the first line, print the case number, followed by a colon, followed by a single space, followed by the total number of intersections passed to reach all elements of J from A, not counting intersection A or the intersections in J. Then print 2K(K+1) line, one for each possible edge in the grid. Each of these lines should contain (in this order): an integer x, an integer y, and an integer d from the set {0,1} where x and y are valid intersection numbers, and dx to y or dy to x. The two nodes in an edge can be printed in any order as long as the correct d is printed. Similarly, the edges can be printed in any order.

During the pre-puja bonanza, the Khelnacompany has put K different types (numbered from 1 to K) of Disney figurines in their hot-selling RC cars. You can find the Disney figurine only after you have bought a RC car and opened the box. Sumana just loves Khelnacompany’s cars and the Disney characters, and wants to collect as many different Disney figurines as possible. So Sumana tries to trade some of the figurines she has with her M friends to get figurines that she does not have. Any of Sumana’s friends (say X) will trade a figurine with Sumana if  and only if X has a duplicate of that figurine, and Sumana gives X a figurine X does not have. Moreover, Sumana’s friends are not as crazy as Sumana about collecting figurines, so they don’t exchange any figurines among themselves; they just exchange with Sumana to make her happy. Sumana is clever and has realized that in some cases it might be good to exchange a Disney figurine she has for another figurine of a type she already possesses, or trade off a figurine even if she has only one copy of it. Given that Sumana knows exactly how many figurines of each type each of her friends has, can you help her find the maximum number of different Disney figurines that she can get by trading figurines with her friends?  Input The first line contains the number of tests cases N For each test case, the first line contains the value of K and M.

Consider two sequences A and B comprising of digits 0 to 9, of length K and L respectively. The distance from A to B is the total minimum penalty incurred in converting A to B using the following operations, each of which incurs a penalty as described below.  Replacing a digit of A with another digit: incurs a penalty of 1 Inserting a digit in A: incurs a penalty of 1 for each digit inserted. In addition, there is also a fixed penalty of x for every sequence of digits inserted (one-time penalty for starting the sequence, not per-digit). However, the total penalty charged for a sequence of digits inserted never exceeds y (y > x). For example, if x = 2 and y = 5, then inserting a one digit sequence (say “5”) will incur a penalty of 3 (=x+1), a 2-digit sequence (say “24”) will incur a penalty of 4 (=x+2), and inserting any n-digit sequence (n > 2) (say “132”, 2543”, “57241” etc.) will all incur a penalty of 5 (=y). Deleting a digit from A: incurs a penalty of 1 for each digit deleted. In addition, there is also a fixed penalty of x for every sequence of digits deleted (one-time penalty for starting the sequence, not per-digit).  What is the minimum penalty with which A can be converted to B?  Input The first line contains the number of tests cases N For each test case, the first line contains the integers K and L.

Professor Calculus wishes to hire graduate engineers for a few open positions in his funded projects. He has called K candidates for interview (numbered from 1 to K), and based on the profile of the candidates, has decided on an estimated time duration of interview for each candidate. A single interview board is going to conduct all the interviews. Assume that the interview board starts the interviews at time t = 0. Since candidates from outside the town may want to go back on the same day, Professor Calculus has asked each candidate for the departure time of the train that they wish to take to go back after the interview. Many candidates have indicated such times, while others who are local candidates or non-local candidates who do not wish to go back the same day have not. In order to cause any inconvenience to as few of the candidates as possible, Professor Calculus attempts to order the interviews such that the number of candidates who wish to go back the same day after the interview but will miss their trains is minimized. Assume that to catch a train, the interview of each candidate has to end at least 30 minutes before the departure time of the train the candidate wishes to take. You can also assume that all departure times specified are more than 30 minutes after the start of the first interview at t = 0. Can you help the Professor Calculus prepare a schedule of the interviews so that the number of candidates who miss their trains is minimized?  Input The first line contains the number of test cases N (0 < N ≤ 3). For each test case, the first line contains the number of candidates K (0 < K ≤ 100). The second line contains a sequence of K positive integers indicating the estimated interview duration in minutes of the K candidates. The third line contains a sequence of K positive integers indicating the time, in number of minutes from t = 0, of the departure time of a train that a candidate has to catch. If a candidate has not given any such time, the corresponding integer is set to -1.

Academia University is hosting BitFest at GridLand, with participants from Academia (host) and other colleges (guest). The first event is a team coding event BlindDate, with each team containing one student from host and one from guest. H host participants and G guest participants have assembled in GridLand. All of them wish to participate in BlindDate. GridLand is shaped as a K×K grid, and each grid point in the grid is specified by a pair of coordinates. The lowermost, leftmost grid point has coordinates (0,0) and therefore the rightmost, uppermost grid point has coordinates (K, K). The grid points are connected by roads that run north-south and east-west along the edges of the grid, so that he distance between two grid points (p,q) and (r,s) is the Manhattan distance between them (= |p-r| + |q-s|). Each participant initially stands on a grid point (more than one participant can stand on the same grid point) and the game will finally be played in the Arena which is located at the grid point (K, K). Professor BitGuy is organizing BlindDate and he will decide the teams. Once the teams are formed, the host member moves to the guest member, picks him or her up, and they both move towards the Arena. A participant can be a member of only one team. Every host participant moves with a unit speed towards the designated guest member of her team along the roads, and both of them then move with unit speed to the arena along the roads. Prof. BitGuy has to form the teams at time t = 0 in a manner such that the competition can start at a given positive integer time C. Assume that the team formation takes no time. What is the maximum number of teams BitGuy can form?  Input The first line contains the number of test cases, N (0 < N ≤ 3).

Professor PariBrajika wishes to plan a tour from Kharagpur to Himalpur using Pushpak Travels. There are K tourist locations serviced by Pushpak Travels, numbered from 1 to K, including Kharagpur (numbered 1) and Himalpur (numbered K). It is only possible to travel directly from some locations to some other locations. For any pair of locations for which direct travel is possible, the travel from the originating city can start only at some specific time intervals of the day and the travel time depends on the starting time interval from the originating city because of different reasons such as vehicle type availability, traffic, and other environmental conditions. We will refer to each such 5-tuple <u,v,s,f,t> where u is the originating location, v is the destination location, s and f are the start and finish of a time interval within which travel can start at u, and t is the travel time in hours from u to v when starting within the closed interval [s,f], as a route. The elements s and f are specified as hours of the day, in 24-hour format (i.e. 0 to 23). For a particular origin-destination pair, you can assume that all intervals specified are non-overlapping. You can also assume that the routes are such that even with the above constraints, it is possible to reach Himalpur from Kharagpur passing through 0 or more of the other locations. Professor PariBrajika cannot travel continuously without rest. The number of hours she can travel continuously without rest is equal to the "energy credit" she has. She can earn an energy credit of 1 hour for every hour of rest she takes (rest can be taken in integer multiples of hours only). However, she can rest only at any of the tourist locations. She spends an energy credit of 1 hour for every hour she travels. She may decide to rest any time irrespective of the energy credit she has (for example if no route is available for the current time or if a future route will enable her to reach Himalpur earlier through some other path). In that case, she has unspent energy credit left and can accumulate further energy credit. Energy credits can be accumulated cumulatively during the journey, subject to a maximum of 6 hours worth of travel time. Therefore, she cannot travel for more than 6 hours continuously in any case after the last recharge. If Professor Paribrajika can leave Kharagpur anytime after midnight (t ≥ 0), find the earliest time, expressed as the total number of hours elapsed since t=0 (midnight), at which Professor PariBrajika can reach Himalpur. Assume that at the start of the journey she is fully rested and is good to go for 6 hours (i.e., has energy credits of 6 hours).  Input The first line contains the number of test cases, N (0 < N ≤ 3). For each test case, the first line contains the number of locations K (0 < K ≤ 500), and the total number of routes M (0 < M ≤ 10000). This is followed by M lines, with each line containing the information of a single route, specified by five integers u, v, s, f, t (in this order with one or more space between two successive integers). The integers correspond to the 5-tuple  as described earlier (1 ≤ u, v ≤ K, 0 ≤ s, f ≤ 23, s < f, t > 0).  Output For each test case, print the case number, followed by a colon, followed by a single space, followed by a single integer indicating the earliest time in hours from the time t=0 to reach Himalpur.

Professor PariBrajika is in Himalpur and wishes to go to Gyankut to attend a workshop. There are K temples on the way to Gyankut. The temples are numbered from 1 to K, Himalpur is numbered 0 and Gyankut is numbered K+1. She wishes to visit some of the temples on her onward journey from Himalpur to Gyankut, and the rest on her return journey from Gyankut to Himalpur. In her onward journey she must visit the chosen temples in ascending order of their numbers, and in her return journey she is required to visit the temples in descending order of their numbers. Any violation of this will waylay her and she will get permanently lost. For example, if K = 7, and she selects to visit (2,4,5) on her onward journey, she must travel from Himalpur to 2, 2 to 4, 4 to 5, 5 to Gyankut and then Gyankut to 7, 7 to 6, 6 to 3, 3 to 1, and 1 to Himalpur. The estimated travel times between any pair of the locations (with no intermediate stops) are known. A trip from any location X to another location Y takes the same time as the trip from Y to X. Assume that Professor PariBrajika spends a fixed time R at each of the K temples and at Gyankut. If she starts from Himalpur at time t = 0, what is the minimum estimated time in which Professor PariBrajika can complete the tour from Himalpur to Gyankut and back?  Input The first line contains the number of test cases, N (0 < N ≤ 3). For each test case, the first line contains the two integers, K (0 < K ≤ 100) and R. This is followed by K+2 lines, with each line containing information about travel time from one location to all other locations. Each line starts with an integer id X of the location (0 < X < K+1), followed by K+1 pairs of integers (total 2K+2 integers), with each pair containing the id Y (0 < Y < K+1, X ≠ Y) of another location and the estimated travel time (positive integer) to location Y from location X.  Output For each test case, in the first line, print the case number, followed by a colon, followed by a single space, followed by a single integer indicating estimated minimum travel time.

Professor Calculus gives the following problem to his students: given two integers X (≥ 2) and Y (≥ 2), find the smallest positive integral exponent E such that the decimal expansion of X^E begins with Y. For example, if X = 8 and Y = 51, then X^3 = 512 begins with Y = 51, so E = 3. It is easy to see that neither E = 1 nor E = 2 will satisfy this property, so 3 is the smallest possible value of E in this case. Professor Calculus has also announced that he is only interested in values of X such that X is not a power of 10. The professor has a proof that in this case, at least one value of E exists for any Y. The students set out to write a program for this, and run it on their department's server. However, they quickly find out that even though X, Y, and E will fit into a single integer, X^E may be too large to fit into any single data type of any language they can program in. Can you help the students to find the value of the exponent E?  Input The first line contains the number of test cases N (0 < N ≤ 3). For each test case, there is a single line containing the integers X and Y.  Output For each test case, in the first line, print the case number, followed by a colon, followed by a single space, followed by a single integer indicating estimated minimum travel time.  Constraints: 1 ≤ X, E ≤ 1000  Sample Input  2 5 156 16 4  Sample Output  Case 1: 6 Case 2: 3 
The stupendous current form and cricketing class that Virat Kohli possesses certainly makes him the "King of Cricket" at the moment. One evening he was dreaming of his present competitors in world cricket. He dreamt about the infinite Cartesian coordinates with N kings placed on it at different integer positions (x,y) initially. But suddenly his alarm rings and bang, it was time to gear up for the all important upcoming match India vs Australia. However on his way to stadium in the bus he ponders over the minimum total number of moves required to bring any K kings to the same position. A position can hold multiple kings at the same time. A single move consists of choosing exactly one king and moving it one unit in either of the four directions, up, down, right or left. Help him find a solution quickly to this problem so that he can concentrate on scoring runs, which he is best at.  Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. Each test case consists of N+1 lines. The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers N and K. Then follow N lines, each containing two space separated integers x and y, denoting the initial position of the 'i'th king (1 ≤ i ≤ N).     Output  For each test case, output a single line containing the minimum total number of moves required to bring any K kings to the same position.     Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 20 1 ≤ N ≤ 100 -10^9 ≤ x,y ≤ 10^9     Example Input: 1 3 2 2 4 1 2 3 5  Output: 2   Explanation:  In the given test case, we need to bring any 2 kings to the same position. The total number of moves can be minimized if we bring the 1st king and the 3rd king to position (3,5). The 1st king will need 2 moves to reach there and the 3rd king will need 0 moves. Therefore, the answer will be 2+0 = 2.   
  Kewal just returned from school where he learned that “if the last digit of a number is divisible by 2,then it is an even number.” However he forgot that this property holds only for integers.Anyways to keep him happy, we would consider his ideology for floating point numbers as well. Thus we would have   Thus we would have 12.6 as even(last digit even(6)) 12.7 as odd(last digit odd(7)) 12.70 as odd(last digit odd(7)) as 12.7 is same as 12.70 (discarded zeroes) Following his ideology, your task is to write a program to check whether the entered floating point  numbers are even or odd.  Input A single line containing the number of test cases T. T lines follow each containing a single floating point number F for each test case.  Output  T lines specifying even or odd in order of test cases.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 The total length of floating point number including the decimal point should be |F| ≤ 20   Example  Input 5 2.004 345.10 555.55 26.324 72.09  Output even odd odd even odd   
 Sum and Color Chef is a mathematics student. His professor has given him a difficult task. Professor initially provides Chef with a list of numbers. For every number in the list, Chef has to calculate the sum 'S' of digits such that 0<=S<=9. Even if the sum of digits is coming as a 'n' digit number, Chef has to bring it down to 1 digit number by further calculating the sum of the n digits and so on. Each value of final one digit sum is assigned a color. The color starts from index 0 to 9 and the value for each is given as follows:-  0-red 1-blue 2-pink 3-white 4-black 5-violet 6-cyan 7-yellow 8-green 9-brown  For each number in the list, Chef will obtain a 1 digit sum at the end. From these sums, Chef needs to find the color relating to the maximum 1 digit sum from the list. Professor clarifies the problem through the following example: Consider a list of 2 numbers 52 and 181. The addition of digits of number 52 gives 52=5+2=7, and that of 181 gives 181=1+8+1=10=1+0=1. So the maximum value is 7. So look at the color present at index 7 i.e. 'yellow'. So the output is yellow. Help Chef write a program for this problem.  Input   The first line contains one integer ‘T’, which denotes Number of test cases. There are 2 lines for each of  ‘T’ test case   First line contains the total number of elements ’N’ in the list Second line ‘N’ numbers (each number can be considered as ‘Ai’)separated by whitespaces.    Output For each text case, You need to print one line containing the color obtained according to the maximum value of 'S' i.e. the color corresponding to maximum 1digit sum of number in the list  Constraints   1<=T<=100 1<=N<=250000 0<=Ai<=10^9  Example1 Input: 5 5 128 25 87 50 1558 4 11 22 33 44 3 36 14 1000 5 11112 95 96 256 2669 3 10 991 83   Output:  yellow green brown cyan pink    Explanation  Consider the 1st case:  Calculate sum of digits of every element  128=1+2+8=11=1+1=2  25=2+5=7  87=8+7=15=1+5=6  50=5+0=5  1558=1+5+5+8=19=1+9=10=1+0=1  So the maximum value is 7 and the output is the corresponding color to index 7 i.e.yellow.  
  Chef loves palindromes. Chef initially has odd number of charachters. Chef wants to create a palindrome of maximum even length using these characters. For this Chef needs to discard one character. Help Chef find the character which needs to be discarded so that he can use the rest characters in any order to form a palindrome haivng maximum even length.   Input  An integer 'T' on first line denoting number of test cases For each of the 'T' testcases, there are two lines First line contains an integer 'N' denoting number of characters in list Second line contains 'N' lowercase aphabetic characters which are not seperated by spaces   Output  For each of the 'T' test cases, display in a new line the character to be discarded   Constraints  N <= 12353 T <= 25   Example Input: 2 7 abcbdca 3 abb Output: d a   Explanation  'a' is a charcter that is repeated at index 0,6 'b' is a charcter that is repeated at index 1,3 'c' is a charcter that is repeated at index 2,5 'd' is a charcter that is only present at index 4 So, we need to remove 'd' so that we can get a palindrome having maximum possible even length.   similarly for 2nd test case "a" is the charcter to be discarded 
Dipen is having a party on his birthday. For his party he has 3 types of chocolates: Kitkat, Lollipop and Fivestar for his friends to enjoy. To keep a check on the number of people, he gave them T-shirts, all having distinct numbers. All the people who wanted Kitkat stood in line A, those who wanted Lollipop stood in line B and those who wanted Fivestar stood in line C. A person can stand in more than one line but not in the same line again. Dipen wants to know the number of people who have Kitkat and Lollipop, Lollipop and Fivestar, Fivestar and Kitkat and people who have all the three chocolates.  Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains 3 space separated integers A, B and C denoting the number of people in each line. The second line contains people in line A. The third line contains people in line B. The fourth line contains people in line C.   Output  For each test case output a single line containing four space separated integers denoting number of people who had Kitkat and Lollipop, Lollipop and Fivestar, Fivestar and Kitkat and people who had all the three chocolates.

Siyara is given an integer array N. Her friend Vatsal gives her 3 types of queries as follows:  Type 1: 1 M To add a number M in the array at any position Type 2: 2 M To delete all occurrences of M from the array. If it is not possible, then ignore the query. Type 3: 3 0 Display the sum of the greatest and second greatest number (other than the greatest) from the array. If not possible, print -1.  Since the numbers are huge, you have to help Siyara solve the problem as quickly as possible.  Input  The first line contains two space separated integers, T and N where T is the number of queries and N is the number of elements in the array. Next line contains N space separated array elements. T lines follow where each line has contains 2 integers. First denoting the type of query: 1, 2 or 3 and the second integer specifying the description provided above.   Output  Only Type 3 queries should be printed, each on a new line.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000 -10^9 ≤ N[i], M ≤ 10^9     Example Input: 6 6 1 2 2 2 3 4 1 2 2 3 3 0 2 2 2 4 3 0  Output: 6 -1  Explanation After executing the first query the array becomes {1,2,2,2,3,4,2}, after the second query {1,2,2,2,2,4}, after the third query {4+2}=6, after the fourth query {1,4}, after the fifth query {1}, thus after the sixth query -1.  
Jack and Jill got into a serious fight. Jack didn't not belive Jill when she said that her memory was far better than the others. He asked her to prove it as follows :-   Jack would dictate a long list of numbers to her. At any point after he has dictated  at least "k" numbers, he can ask her what is the k-th minimum number (the k-th number if the numbers are arranged in increasing order) in the list so far.  She succeeds in proving herself if she can tell the k-th minimum number every time he asks.  The number of queries (dictate a new number or ask her the k-th minimum of the numbers given till then) has to be pre-decided before he starts asking.  Jill succeeded in proving herself by convincing Jack quite a few times. Now, Jill remembered that Jack had claimed that he was good at programming. It's her turn to ask him to prove his skill. Jack doesn't want to lose to her and comes to you for help. He asks you to make the program for him.   Input Jill has agreed to let Jack decide the format of the input and here's what he has decided. First line of the input contains n, the number of queries. Next line contains k. Next n lines contain a query each, say q. If  q ≥ 0  then the number is being 'dictated' to the system and needs to be remembered. If q = -1, then your program should return the k-th minimum number presented so far . It is given that 'q' can be -1 only if at least k numbers have already been given.   Output  For every q = -1, you have to output the k-th minimum number given as input so far (not counting -1 as an input)   Example  Input1: 6 2 3 2 -1 -1 1 -1  Output1: 3 3 2   Input2: 10 5 3 6 1 4 2 9 3 1 0 -1  Output2: 3 
 Little Boy Banku is mad at his teacher, who ate all the sweets in the flat and even went to the neighbours to eat their sweets too. Now Banku's parents brought home a chocolate bar, and, sure enough, School teacher is here already and wants to eat it. However, this time Banku has firmly decided that not a single piece of chocolate will go to this glutton. Banku wants to use his teacher's addiction to the games of chance and suggests playing the following game. A chocolate bar can be considered as a rectangle of square “units” arranged in m rows and n columns and separated by “lines”. Two players take alternate turns. At his turn, a player must take one piece of chocolate and split it into two along one of the lines. If a player can't make a legal move (which happens when all pieces of chocolate consist of a single unit square), he loses, and the winner takes all the chocolate. But the teacher is smart enough! He immediately understood who should make the first turn in order for teacher to win, assuming that players take optimal turns. Can you guess that?  Input  First line of input contains number of test cases. The second line of the input contains space-separated integers m and n (1 <= m, n <= 50).  Output  For each test case If teacher should start the game in order to win, output "[:=[first]" otherwise, output "[second]=:]".  Example  Input: 3 2 4 1 3 2 9   Output: [:=[first] [second]=:] [:=[first] 
 Daenerys Targaryen has been suggested by her counselors to leave the Meereen and start conquering other parts of the world. But she knows giving up on the people of Meereen means victory of slavery. Her plan is to start conquering rest of the world while she remains in Meereen. She can only trust her bravest and most beloved Daario Naharis to undertake this risk. She asks him to conquer a few nations and promises him a help from her dragons. She also promises to marry him if he successfully conquers all the nations and not if he is defeated. Daario has to conquer 'N' number of nations each nation with army size A[i]. He attacks the nations serially. As promised, he gets help from Daenerys's Dragons. His first 'M' attacks are made with the help of Dragons.   For first 'M' attacks, he gains A[i] soldiers.  For the rest, he looses ceiling of A[i]/2 soldiers.  He is defeated if he is left with no army before he conquers all the 'N' nations. He has no army initially and only has Dragons.  Input First line has 'T' which is the number of test cases. For each test cases there are two space separated integers 'N' and 'M' denoting the number of nations and the number of nations he has Dragon's help for respectively. Follows N space separated integers denoting the size of army of each nation.  Output Print 'VICTORY' if Daario conquers all nations and 'DEFEAT' if he doesn't.    Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 500 1 ≤ M ≤N ≤ 100000 1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 100000     Example Input:  3 5 3 1 2 3 4 5 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 7 4 10 10 10 10 50 60 70  Output:  VICTORY VICTORY DEFEAT     Explanation Example case 1. First 3 attacks add 1,2,3 to his army making it 6. (1+2+3 = 6) Then he looses 2 and 3 making it 1. (6-2-3 = 1) He conquers all so VICTORY.  Example case 2. First 2 attacks add 4,4 to his army making it 8. (4+4 = 8) Then he looses 2,2,2,2 making it 0. (8-2-2-2-2 = 0) He conquers all so VICTORY.  Example case 3. First 4 attacks add 10,10,10,10 to his army making it 40. (10+10+10+10 = 40) Then he looses 25 and then all 15 out of possible 30 making it 0. (40-25-15 = 0) He is defeated on 6th attack so DEFEAT.  
 Problem Statement  	Chef has bought T strings to gift his friend Jay. Later he realized that Jay only likes those strings which are wonderful. A string is wonderful only if all the characters in that string are repeated the same number of times. Chef can change any letter of the string to any other letter, but it costs one coin for him to do so. Now he wants to know the minimum number of coins required to make each string wonderful.   Input  	The first line of input contains an integer T. T lines follow. Each containing a string S composed of only lower-case letters.   Output  	For each string, print minimum number of coins required in a new line.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 1500 1 ≤ |S| ≤ 2000   Example Input: 3 tathva jay codechef  Output: 1 0 2    Explanation  Case 3: One possible solution is codecdeo. 'h' is changed to 'd' and 'f' is changed to 'o', which makes the string wonderful. Number of coins required = 2. Case 2: Each of the characters ('j' , 'a' and 'y') are repeated exactly once. So it is already a wonderful string. NO coins are required. Case 1: Optimal way is to change 'h' to 'v' or 'v' to 'h'. Number of coins required =  1.   NOTE : Time limit for this problem is 0.3 seconds. 
Given an alphanumeric string made up of digits and lower case Latin characters only, find the sum of all the digit characters in the string.  Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case is described with a single line containing a string S, the alphanumeric string.   Output  For each test case, output a single line containing the sum of all the digit characters in that string.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 1000 1 ≤ |S| ≤ 1000, where |S| is the length of the string S.   Example Input: 1 ab1231da  Output: 7  Explanation The digits in this string are 1, 2, 3 and 1. Hence, the sum of all of them is 7. 
 Ramesh, Suresh, Mahesh, and Mukesh are moving to a new city and are looking for apartments to live.   Now this city is not like any other city. This city is a matrix of apartments and there are no roads. The only way to commute is to go through apartments.   If any of the friends go through an apartment even once, the group will have to pay its full rent. From an apartment, you can go to the apartments to its North, South, East, or West.   Since Ramesh, Suresh, Mahesh, and Mukesh are best friends, they want to meet each other at least once a month. Also, all four are highly superstitious, so Ramesh only goes West, Suresh only goes North, Mahesh only goes East, and Mukesh only goes South.   Any number of people can live in any of the apartments. Cost of all the apartments in the city is given, some of which may be negative. Negative cost means if any of the friend lives in or goes through this apartment, the group will get paid an amount equal to the negation of the cost. Now the aim of the four friends is to find the minimum cost for which all of them can live in the city and meet each other at least once a month. Note: The four friends can meet in an apartment where none of them actually lives as well.  Input First line contains T, the number of test cases to follow. First line of each test case contains two integers: N and M, where N denotes the number of rows in the matrix and M denotes number of columns in the matrix. Next N lines describe the rows of the matrix follow, one row per line. Each row contains M space-separated integers denoting the cost of the apartment.  Output For each test cases, output the minimum cost as asked in the problem.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 4*10^4 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^3 1 ≤ M ≤ 10^3 -10^4 ≤ Cost of any apartment ≤ 10^4 1 ≤ Sum of N*M over all test cases ≤ 10^6   Example Input: 4 3 3 1 2 3 4 -10 5 6 7 8 3 3 1 -10 3 -13 -12 -11 7 8 9 3 3 1 -2 3 -4 5 -6 7 -8 9 4 4 1 2 3 4 5 6 -7 8 -9 -10 -11 -12 13 14 -15 16  Output: -10 -46 -15 -64   Explanation Example case 1.All 4 friends stay at the apartment which has rent -10. Example case 2.Mukesh lives in the apartment with rent -10, Mahesh lives in the apartment with rent -13, Suresh lives in the apartment with rent -12, and Ramesh lives in the apartment with rent -11 Example case 3.Mukesh lives in the apartment with rent -2, Mahesh lives in the apartment with rent -4, Suresh lives in the apartment with rent -8, and Ramesh lives in apartment with rent -6. They all meet at the apartment with rent 5. So the total cost becomes (-2) + (-6) + (-4) + (-8) + (5) = -15 Example case 4.Mukesh lives in the apartment with rent -7, Mahesh lives in the apartment with rent -9, Suresh lives in the apartment with rent -15, and Ramesh lives in the apartment with rent -12. They all meet at the apartment with rent -11. So the total cost becomes -7-9-10-11-12-15 = -64 
 You are given a 1-indexed array of size N. Initially, all elements of the array are zeros. You need to perform U updates to the array.   Each Update asks you to add 1 to the elements of the array at the indices specified by 'ax+b' for all non-negative integers x, where a and b are positive integers which specify an update query.   After performing all the updates to the array, print the array with every entry separated by space.   Input First Line of the input contains 2 space separated integers N, U.

WARNING: The Input files may be as large as 8 MB. Use faster I/O methods. There is a tree, consisting of N nodes. A path is a sequence of one or more nodes of this tree, where every two adjacent nodes are connected by an edge and no node is visited twice. Generally, there are N^2 paths. Note that we are counting paths from each node onto itself as well. One path is smaller than another if the sequence of nodes of the first path is lexicographically smaller than the sequence of nodes of the second path (by usual rules). Thus (1,3,2) will be smaller than (1,3,4,5). And (2,4) will be smaller than (3). Every day, Lucy writes out a path on a sheet of paper. On the first day, she writes the lexicographically smallest path. On the second day, she writes the lexicographically second smallest path, and so on. Generally, on the K^th day, Lucy writes out the lexicographically K^th smallest path. Nana likes to read Lucy's notes about the paths in the tree. She is curious about the path that will be written on the Q^th day. Could you please help her?  Input The first line of input consists of a single integer T, the number of the test cases. Then, there are T test cases, given in the following form: the first line of the test case consists of an integer N, the number of nodes and an integer Q, the number from the statement. Then, N-1 lines follow. Each such line will consist of two integers X and Y with the meaning that there's an edge, connecting nodes X and Y in the tree. You may assume that you are always given a valid tree.  Output For every test case, output the lexicographically Q^th smallest path in the given tree on a single line, without leading or trailing spaces. There should be exactly one space between successive nodes in the path. Output the answer to the t^th test case should be given on the t^th line.

Byteline is currently the largest mobile phone operator in Byteland. They have N cellphone towers at different places in Byteland.  Byteland can be viewed as a two dimensional plane, with each tower or skyscraper described by a point in that plane. Of course, no two points have the same coordinates.  Two towers can only communicate with each other if there is no tower nor skyscraper lying on the straight line segment connecting them.   As the most skillful programmer in the company, Johnny's job is to write a program to help Byteland compute the number of pairs of towers which can communicate with each other.   And once again, Johnny has asked for your help!   Input The first line contains a number t (about 15) which is the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow. Each test case has the following form. The first line contains two numbers N and M (1 ≤ N, M ≤ 1000), the number of towers and skyscrapers in Byteland. Each line in the next N lines contains two integers representing the coordinates of the cellphone towers. Finally, each line in the next M lines contains two integers representing the coordinates of the skyscrapers. All coordinates have absolute values not larger than 10000.  Output For each test case, print a single number, describing the number of pairs of towers which can communicate with each other.  Example  Input 1 5 4 -1 -1 1 -1 0 -2 -2 -2 0 0 -1 -2 1 0 -1 1 0 -1  Output 6   Output details   In the above figure, the blue points represent the cell towers and the red points represent the skyscrapers as in the example input. The 6 segments AE, BE, BC, AC, AD and BD correspond to the 6 pairs of towers that can communicate with each other. 
Johnny is the author of the famous open source software ByteDict (Bytelandian electronic dictionary). Being a fan of the word game Scrabble, Johnny would like to make ByteDict useful for Scrabble training. Therefore, he has decided to implement the "Wildcard Matching" feature. Wildcard matching allows ByteDict's users to search for words matching a given wildcard pattern. A wildcard pattern may include the characters '*' or '?' in addition to the characters of the alphabet. A '*' matches any sequence of characters (including the empty sequence) and a '?' matches any single character. To be more precise, a wildcard pattern is matched with a word if we can replace each '?' with an alphabet character and each '*' with a sequence of alphabet characters so that after replacement, the pattern becomes identical to the word. Now, as usual, please help Johnny implement the feature!  Input The first line contains a number t (about 2) which is the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow. Each test case has the following form. The first line contains two integers N and Q (1 ≤ N ≤ 55000, 1 ≤ Q ≤ 300) which are the number of words in the dictionary and the number of wildcard queries. Each line in the next N lines contains a word from the dictionary. The alphabet consists of lower and uppercase characters as well as digits. Each line in the next Q lines contains a wildcard pattern. The length of each word does not exceed 25 and the length of each wildcard pattern does not exceed 5. Each test case is separated by a blank line.  Output For each wildcard query print a line containing the query itself and the number of words in the dictionary that match the query. Print a blank line after each test case's output.  Example  Input: 2 1 7 abc abc cba a?? ??a *?a *** **a  7 4 spoj codechef uva tju onlinejudge Acmicpc Worldcup2010 *a* sp?* *c* uvc  Output: abc 1 cba 0 a?? 1 ??a 0 *?a 0 *** 1 **a 0  *a* 1 sp?* 1 *c* 3 uvc 0 
The BSA (Bytelandian Security Agency) has intercepted several secret keys from the Trojan Kingdom. Each secret key is a prime number. But BSA was only able to retrieve some part of the digits, not all of them!  Johnny's job is to help BSA recover these lost primes, and he has delegated the task to you!  Input The first line contains a number t (about 15) which is the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow. Each test case is described in a single line containing the  patterns of the lost primes (the unknown digits are represented by '?'s. Each pattern's length is at most 12.  Output For each test case, print the recovered prime. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them. The recovered prime should have the same number of digits as the corresponding pattern and should contain no leading zeros. You can assume that there is at least one solution for each test case.  Example  Input: 3 ? ?3 1??  Output: 5 23 101  
Two friends live in a small city. The city is built in the form of a circular road and skyscrapers surrounding the road. But one day the two friends quarreled with each other, and although they remained in the city, they decided to live in apartments located as far as possible from each other, or more precisely, so as to maximize the travel time between them. All the skyscrapers are arranged in a circle around the road (so you can travel in a cycle as follows: 1 <-> 2 <-> 3 <-> ... <-> n <-> 1), and the travel time between two neighbouring buildings is 1. The travel time between two adjacent floors of a skyscraper is also 1, and the friends can choose to live in any floor of the building, from the 0-th to the k-th, assuming that the skyscraper in question has k floors. Thus, the travel time from the j-th floor to ground level is j time units.  Input First, 1≤n≤10^6, the number of skyscrapers. The following numbers, 1≤h1≤10^9,...1≤hn≤10^9, are the heights of the buildings, given in clockwise order.  Output Output exactly one number, the maximal possible travel time.  Example Input: 4 1 2 3 4  Output: 8 Input: 10 1 7 4 3 2 9 2 3 4 5  Output: 20    Please note: the time limit for this problem is extremely strict!

Concerned with the fitness levels of the players in the National Team, the coach decides to carry out a running drill in the next training session. So, he sets up checkpoints in the training ground at different positions. After evaluating each player’s fitness, the coach asks each player to cover a certain minimum distance while completing all checkpoints (Suppose a players starts at checkpoint 2, then he must cover all checkpoints and finish at checkpoint 2). Players being lazy want to finish the drill in exact distance that the coach assigns them. Is it possible?  Input Input description.  First line with two space separated integers N and L , the number of checkpoints and the minimum distance that coach asks the player to cover, respectively Then N lines containing N space separated integers each. The jth integer on the ith line, dij, denotes the distance between checkpoint point i and j (dij for i != j, and dii = 0). For all 1 ≤ i, j, k ≤ N it is the case that dij = dji and dij ≤ dik + dkj.   Output For each test case, output a single line containing the answer i.e. POSSIBLE or IMPOSSIBLE.  Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 14 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^14^ 1 ≤ dij ≤ L   Example Input:  5 15 0 2 3 3 2 2 0 3 2 3 3 3 0 2 2 3 2 2 0 3 2 3 2 3 0  Output: POSSIBLE 
You are given two strings S and T each consisting of n characters. Each character in both the strings is one of the first ten Latin lowercase alphabet letters ('a'-'j'). The characters are numbered 1 through n in both strings. Let's denote S[l..r] as a substring of S which begins at the l'th character of S and ends at the r'th character of S. Longest common prefix (LCP) of two strings is the longest prefix of the first string which is also a prefix of the second. You are asked to process q queries of the following kind: You are given two integers x and y (1 ≤ x, y ≤ n). Your task is to find the length of the LCP of S[x..n] and T[y..n]. You are allowed to apply some permutation to all of the distinct letters of S before finding the LCP. More formally, you should make a bijection from letters 'a'-'j' to the same set of letters, replace each letter of S with the corresponding value in the bijection and then find the LCP. You should pick the bijection so that the LCP is as large as possible. If there are several possible bijections, you should pick the one with the least possible letter assigned to 'a', then (if still ambiguous) to 'b' and so on. Please note that the changes in S doesn't propagate over queries, i.e. all the string transformations are only within a single query and should be rolled back before processing the next one.  Input The first line of the input contains one integer T denoting the number of test cases. The first line of the test case description contains two integers n and q. The next two lines contain two string S and T respectively. Each of the next q lines contains two integers x and y denoting a query to process.  Output For each of the queries, output the length of the LCP together with the optimal bijection in the format "{the letter assigned to 'a'}{the letter assigned to 'b'}...{the letter assigned to 'j'}".  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 5 1 ≤ n ≤ 125000 1 ≤ q ≤ 50000   Example Input: 1 5 3 ababa babaa 1 1 1 3 5 4  Output: 4 bacdefghij 2 bacdefghij 1 abcdefghij 
  Bunny and Lucky are good friends. One day Bunny decided to play a game with Lucky. So he gave two numbers (a and b) and ask her to find the multiplication of a and b. She is good at mathematics, so she multiplied them and gave the answer within seconds. So he decided to add some more spicy to the problem. So he asked her to add all digits in the result until the resultant will be a single digit. Let’s consider a = 11 and b = 8, 11X8 = 88 from the result 8+8 = 16 then for 16, 1+6 = 7. So finally the answer is 7. But it is difficult her to find the vale for larger numbers. 	So help her in finding the single digit value.    Input Input description.  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows." The first line of each test case contains two integers a ans b     Output       For each test case, output a single line containing a single digit value.      Constraints Should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have. Format it like:  1 ≤ T ≤ 10^5 0 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^18     Example Input: 3 2 5 8 8 8 11  Output: 1 1 7    Explanation Example case 2: 8*8 = 64 from that 6+4 = 10 the 1+0 = 1, so the answer is 1. 
A Little Elephant and his friends from the Zoo of Lviv like candies very much.  There are N elephants in the Zoo. The elephant with number K (1 ≤ K ≤ N) will be happy if he receives at least AK candies. There are C candies in all in the Zoo.  The Zoo staff is interested in knowing whether it is possible to make all the N elephants happy by giving each elephant at least as many candies as he wants, that is, the K^th elephant should receive at least AK candies. Each candy can be given to only one elephant. Print Yes if it is possible and No otherwise.   Input The first line of the input file contains an integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. Each test case consists of exactly 2 lines. The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers N and C, the total number of elephants and the total number of candies in the Zoo respectively. The second line contains N space separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN.   Output For each test case output exactly one line containing the string Yes if it possible to make all elephants happy and the string No otherwise. Output is case sensitive. So do not print YES or yes.   Constraints 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000 1 ≤ N ≤ 100 1 ≤ C ≤ 10^9 1 ≤ AK ≤ 10000, for K = 1, 2, ..., N  Example  Input: 2 2 3 1 1 3 7 4 2 2  Output: Yes No    Explanation Case 1. We can give one candy to the first elephant and two candies to the second elephant and make them both happy. Hence the answer is Yes. Alternatively we can give one candy to each elephant and left one candy for ourselves but they again will be happy.  Case 2. Even if we give four candies to the first elephant and two candies to the second elephant we will have only one candy left and can not make last elephant happy since he needs two candies for his happiness. Hence the answer is No.

 Problem description. Royal Britannian family has got a gift- 'N' toffees by the courtesy of area 11.Now everybody loves these toffees and they decide to have them at breakfast.All of them are kept in the refrigerator. The family has 'A' adults and 'B' babies(A ≥ B).Since the adults are cunning they want to ensure that they get a large share of toffees.After dinner, first adult goes to the refrigerator gives a toffee to each baby and divides the rest in 'A' parts takes his share and comes back.This is done by every adult in the night. When every body gets in the morning there are only 'K' toffees left. Given A and B, you have to tell the minimum 'N' which makes this distribution possible and 'K'. Obviously the number of toffees can't b fractional or negative.  Input One line containing no. of test cases 't' followed by 't' lines containing 'A' and 'B' each.  Output in a single line output the N and K for each test case.  Constraints:   3 <= A <= 10 B <= A test cases 't' < 100  Example: Input: 1 3 2  Output: 23 4  Explanation: 23 toffees in the refrigerator.First adult gives 2 to the babies and takes 7. remaining = 14. Second adult goes and gives 2 to the babies and takes 4. remaining = 8. Third adult goes and gives 2 to the babies and takes 2. remaining = 2. 
There were a little elephant and an ox in Byteland. They were best friends. Once they went to forest to get some fruits. The little elephants could get N fruits and the ox got M fruits. While returning home, they decided to equalize the number of fruits they have. So, they decided to play a game. In each turn, one will divide the fruits of the other into some groups such that each group has equal number of fruits and then he will keep one group apart and eat all fruits in the other groups (see explanation) . The game continues until the number of fruiits they have becomes equal.The little elephant starts the game. Now, you have to tell how many maximum number of fruits they can take home after this game.  Input First line of the input contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. Then T lines follow, each line having two space separated integers N and M, which denote the number of fruits they initially have.  Output For each test case output a single line containg an integer which is the maximum number of fruits they can take home.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤  10000 1 ≤ N, M ≤ 10000     Example Input: 2 4 6 5 3  Output: 2 1    Explanation Case 1:Initially the little elephant has 4 fruits and the ox has 6 fruits. In the first turn, elephant forms 3 groups of 2 fruits each. He leaves 2 fruits and eat other 4. So, the ox now has 2 fruits. In the second turn, ox can divide 4 fruits into 2 groups of 2 fruits each. He leaves 2 fruits and eat the rest. Now they both have same number of fruits i.e 2. You can check that they can't have more than 2 fruits after the game.

Rohan and Palli decided to play cricket. Well, as expected they dont have a coin to toss. Being the geek he is, Vishal suggested a new way to toss. He asks Palli to choose an integer between A and B (both inclusive) and Rohan to choose either odd or even. Palli already knows that Rohan is an "odd" person and he always chooses odd. Now to win this toss, Palli needs to choose an integer in whose prime factorization, the count of odd powers is strictly greater than the count of even powers. For example, If he chooses the number 13068 It's prime factorization is, 13068 = 2^2x3^3x11^2 Here, there are 2 even powers and 1 odd power. Thus, Palli would lose the toss if he chooses this number. Palli wants to know the total number of integers between A and B (both inclusive) for which he can win this toss.   Input The input contains 2 space-separated integers, A and B.  Output Output a single integer denoting the total number of integers for which Palli will win.  Constraints  2 ≤ A ≤ B ≤ 10^14 |A - B| ≤ 10^5     Example Input: 5 11  Output: 6 
 Mr. Voldemort is a vicious criminal who intends to rob Azkaban. Azkaban is a country consisting of N cities which can be represented as a tree. But Dumbledore's Army (also known as the D.A.) were upto the task of stopping him. Azkaban had one highway which used to connect the cities lying at maximum distance from each other in the whole country i.e No other pair of cities were further apart from each other than these two. To maximise the safety of Azkaban, D.A. placed guards in each city lying on the highway. This highway was also called ‘The Line of Fire’.  There could possibly be many unordered pair of cities lying at maximum distance from each other, but there was only one ‘Line of Fire’ that lied between two cities. Which two cities does the line of fire lie between, Voldemort didn't know that but he did know that it lied between cities at maximum distance from each other. So to avoid risk, he decided to not rob any city that would surely lie on the ‘Line of Fire’ irrespective of which two cities the highway was laid between. Your task is to tell him how many such cities exist.  Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of cities in Azkaban. The second line contains N-1 space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting that there is an connection between the i^th and the A[i]^th city. Also note that Ai will always be less than i.   Output  For each test case, output a single line containing the number of cities that Mr. Voldemort should avoid visiting.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 20 2 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 0 ≤ Ai < i   Example Input: 2 2 0 3 0 1  Output: 2 3  Explanation Example case 1: In the first test case, Azkaban has just 2 cities with a path between them. So there is just one way of picking two cities at maximum distance from each other. Hence the Line of Fire will always pass through both these cities.

 ACM International Collegiate     Programming Contest, Asia-Amritapuri Site, 2012 The Glittering Caves of Aglarond  'Strange are the ways of Men, Legolas! Here they have one of the marvels of the Northern World, and what do they say of it? Caves, they say!     Caves! Holes to fly to in time of war, to store fodder in! My good Legolas, do you know that the caverns of Helm's Deep are vast and beautiful?     There would be an endless pilgrimage of Dwarves, merely to gaze at them, if such things were known to be. Aye indeed, they would pay pure gold for a brief glance!     'And, Legolas, when the torches are kindled and men walk on the sandy floors under the echoing domes, ah! then, Legolas, gems and crystals and veins of     precious ore glint in the polished walls; and the light glows through folded marbles, shell-like, translucent as the living hands of Queen Galadriel.' - Gimli, describing to Legolas the Glittering Caves of Aglarond.  While these caves are by and large natural, there is one place where the Men of Rohan have chiseled into the rock to create a magnificent exhibit. You have a wall of the cave consisting of 'lighted diamonds' arranged in a N by M grid (basically, you have a light behind each diamond which can be turned on or off). Further, you have a switch corresponding to each row of this diamond-grid. When you operate a switch, it will toggle (flip) the lights corresponding to that row.  You are given the current configuration of the lighted diamonds. Gimli challenges Legolas to turn on as many diamonds as possible using EXACTLY K on/off operations of the switches. Since Legolas is an Elf of the Wood and doesn't care much for things that glitter, he instead asks for your help. Note that the same switch (i.e. row) can be chosen multiple times.  Input (STDIN):  The first line contains the number of test cases T. Each test case contains N, M and K on the first line followed by N lines containing M characters each. The ith line denotes the state of the diamonds in the ith row, where '*' denotes a diamond which is on and '.' denotes a diamond which is off.  Output (STDOUT):  Output T lines containing the answer for the corresponding case. Between successive test cases, there should not be any blank lines in the output.  Constraints:  1 <= T <= 100 1 <= N,M <= 50 1 <= K <= 100  Sample Input:   2 2 2 1 .. ** 2 2 2 .. **  Sample Output:   4 2  Notes/Explanation of Sample Input:  In the first test case, row 1 can be toggled hence leaving all 4 lights to be in the ON state. In the second test case, row 1 (or row 2) can be toggled twice, hence maintaining the state of the initial configuration. 
  	On the eve of Republic Day, Teacher decided to distribute candies among  N  students.She brought the candies in a box and placed it in front of students. She allowed every student to take out some candies. But each one of them tried to take out as much candies as possible. That's why, Not all students were happy. She called all students and requested for their bags of candies. Now she wants to distribute candies equally among all bags. She'll be performing two operations.  Pick up a candy from a bag. Put a candy into another bag.  	Both operations require 1 unit of time. You are given with bags of N students with number of candies in it. You have to check whether candies can be distributed equally among all bags or not. If it can be distributed then calculate the time required for total distribution.  Input  First Line contains number of test cases T. Every test case consist of two lines, First line contains N i.e. Number of Bags and next line contains N space separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN , where i^th integer indicates number of candies in i^th bag.     Output  If candies can be distributed equally then output the time required for distribution in new line, else, output "-1" (without quotes) in new line.     Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ N ≤ 100 0 ≤ Number of Candies in each bag ≤ 1000     Example Input: 3 3 1 2 3 3 1 2 1 4 9 7 8 0  Output: 2 -1 12    Explanation Example case 1.Teacher picks up a candy from a bag with maximum candies i.e. 3^rd bag and put it in the bag with minimum candies i.e. 1^st bag. Now all bags have two candies each. Total time required for distribution is 2. 
Viral is playing marbles with his friends. While playing, he accidentally drops N marbles and the marbles are spread on the floor and stopped. Viral notes the position X,Y of the marbles as if the floor were coordinate system and marbles as points. Viral has to pick up the marbles, but Viral is lazy so he wants to decide a line connecting maximum number of marbles. Help Viral find the maximum number of marbles that lie in a line. If two lines have same number of marbles, print number of marbles on any one of them.  Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of points. The second line contains N space-separated integers X and Y denoting the co-ordinates of the points at which the marbles stop.   Output  For each test case, output a single line containing the maximum number of marbles in a line.

A Sniper is standing at the point (x1, y1) on the 2D XY Plane. He shoots from his position towards the point (x2, y2). You may assume that all points are integers. Consider the 2D grid formed by integer points on the XY Plane. The position of the Sniper and the Target are lattice points in this grid. The bullet shot by the Sniper will follow a straight line trajectory from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2). The bullet goes no further than (x2, y2). Consider the trajectory of the bullet when the Sniper is standing at (1, 1) and the Target lies at (4, 3).  Notice how the trajectory of the bullet touches 4 cells. A cell is considered touched by the trajectory if and only if the bullet will enter the cell. How many cells are touched by the trajectory of the bullet? ￼  Input The first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. Each of the following T lines contain one test case each. Each test case contains 4 integers x1, y1, x2 and y2. The integers are separated by single space characters.  Output For each test case, output a single line, containing the number of cells touched by the trajectory of the bullet shot from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2). Remember that a cell is considered touched by the trejectory if and only if the bullet enters the cell - only touching a side is not enough.  Constraints  0 < T < 10100 0 ≤ x1, y1, x2, y2 ≤ 1000000000   Sample Input  3 0 0 3 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 1 0   Sample Output  4 2 0   Explanation In the second test case, the trajectory of the bullet touches the point (1, 1). The bullet does not enter the cells with bottom left corners at (0,1) and (1,0). It directly enters the cell with the bottom left corner at (1,1). Hence, we count only two cells as touched during its trajectory.

This valentine day,a rose-shopkeeper prayed to god to give him some magical power such that he could earn a lot of money.God listened to him & agreed to give him LOVE-MAGIC.But God mentioned some conditions which the shop-keeper would have to follow to learn that MAGIC. CONDITIONS: 1.God will give him the ‘n’ roses to sell & the shop-keeper is’nt allow to sell any extra roses. 2.He has to provide each of his customer an id number.The 1st customer will have the id 1,2nd will have 2 & so on upto ‘n’ & he isn’t allowed to sell roses to a customer who doesn’t have any id.So he can only sell to ‘n’ customers. If the shop-keeper agreed to fulfilled these conditions then God will help him with the MAGIC.The functionalities of the MAGIC are: 1.The ith id customer will surely buy i number of roses. 2.after selling roses to kth id customer, the shop-keeper will be amazed to see that ‘k’ number of roses added to his stock. 3.The ith id customer will surely pay the amount equals to, the square of the number of ways he can choose those ‘i’ roses from the stock multiplied by that customer’s id number. 4.This magic will work for each ‘i’ & ‘k’ where 1 ≤ i,k ≤ n; NOTE: Each customer can buy only once & then his id will be invalid & at any instance of time in the stock the shop-keeper will have all the roses distinct from each other. CONSTRAINT: 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000; 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6;  Input Suppose that day the shop-keeper fulfilled the conditions & the magic works & he able to sell to all the ‘n’ customers.Now,first line of the input an integer ‘T’ will be given indicating the number of test case.Then in following ‘T’ lines,each contains an integer which is the value of ‘n’.

In this problem, the divisors of N do not include the number N itself. For example, if N=24, the divisors of N (excluding N) are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12. Thus, the product of divisors is 1x2x3x4x6x8x12=13824. Since the result may be very large, if the result has more than 4 digits, the program only needs to compute the last 4 digits of it. Input: The first line contains t, the number of test cases (about 300,000). Then t test cases follow. Each test case contains a single integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 500,000) whose product of divisors needs to be computed. Output: For each test case, print a single line containing the corresponding result of that test case.  Example Sample Input: 6 3 4 12 25 957 10000  Sample Output: 1 2 144 5 7493 0000

    Untitled Document !doctype>  Rachel is a girl who lives in LoveTown. She has now finally decided to get married and settle down with her better half. But in LoveTown, it is a rule that you can only marry a person if you have interests which are similar to the other person (or the maximum possible intersection of interests). For example, if the interests of Rachel are “aabbcc”, then the interests of her would be husband must contain all these interests (even the frequency of these interests should be same) and vice versa. Such a match is called the CupidMatch. The order of the interests does not matter. So, some of the possible cases which would be eligible are: abcabc    abcbca    ccbbaa    acacbb While some ineligible ones are:    abc    dabc    hkhj It is of course possible that the interests may not match (or maybe the interests match but the frequency does not). You need to help Rachel in her quest to find the right match by telling her the minimum no of changes required in total (in both the strings) so that that she can attain what is called a CupidMatch. If no changes are required, simply output 0. INPUT    The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description for T test cases follows. Each test case consists of a single line containing two strings, the interests of Emma and the interests of her could be husband separated by a single space. The strings consist of only lower case and upper case English alphabets. The upper case and lower case alphabets are considered to be the same, i.e. there is no case sensitivity. OUTPUT    For each test case, output the sum total of min no of changes required in both the strings to attain a CupidMatch.

               "Nine is considered a good number in Chinese culture because it sounds the same as the word "long-lasting". Hence many             people want their car registration numbers to sum up to 9 on adding the digits recursively.      A car registration number can consist of 1,2,3 or 4 digits. Examples of some good car numbers are 63, 018, 9099, etc. whereas 12,129 are not            good.    Why is 9099 good?   9+0+9+9 = 27   2+7 = 9   Similarly it is not difficult to see why 63, 018, 6669, 9999… are good."           Given a string of digits, print how many subsequences of the string result in good car registration numbers.   Note:           The zeros at the starting of the number are to be accounted for, i.e. 018 and 18 are different numbers.   Input           First line of the input contains T (T <= 200) denoting the number of test cases. T lines follow each containing a non-empty single         string S. S contains only digits i.e. from [0-9]. Length of S <= 10000.   Output           For each case print how many subsequences of the string result in good car registration numbers. As the answer can be quite large print it modulo 1000000007.   Example   Input   2 10292 0189    Output   2 6

 Okay. Before we begin, a hint : This one's taken from somewhere. Word to word. Google comes to mind, doesn't it? Here goes: For the heck of it, we define a new sequence as the infinite sequence of all integers, in ascending order, that can represented as any positive integer power of 5 (i.e 5k where k is a positive integer) or as a sum of distinct positive integer powers of 5 (i.e 5a1 + 5a2 + 5a3 + ... , where a1, a2, a3, ... are distinct positive integers). All the numbers in the lucky sequence are called lucky numbers. The first few numbers are 5, 25, 30, 125, 130, 150, ... Given n your task is to find the nth number in the sequence.    Input  First line of input contains an integer t, t ≤ 200, representing the number of test- cases. Then t lines follow each containing one integer n, 1 ≤ n ≤ 8000.

 Babloo wanted to make Babli a friendship band. He wanted it to read 'str' on her wrist. Once he'd done that and Babli had put it on, he realized that apart from str, a lot of other sentences could be read by changing the first word of the sequence. For example “Babli is the best: Babloo” could also be read “the best: BablooBabli“ on her wrist. So, we give you n different str strings followed by a weird sequence like the one in the example, all you have to do is tell us if it can be read off the string or not.    Input  First line of input contains an integer t, t ≤ 200, representing the number of test- cases. Then 2t lines follow each containing a string followed by the substring to be searched in the next line.

 Tanu was going through exam marks of his class when he observed that some marks values occur frequently, whereas some of them do not occur at all. He suspects that teachers might be giving grace marks to uplift grade of those near the grade-cutoff, or maybe skipping partial marking. There are 5 subjects in the school, labelled A to E. Each student gets marks out of 100 (i.e., integer marks in the inclusive range [0,100]). A mark is said to be over-given for a subject if that mark is obtained by strictly more than 10% of the class in that subject. For each of the subjects (A to E), list the marks that are over-given in that subject.  Input First line contains N, the number of marks in the list. Then N lines follow.Each of the next N lines contains one character from the set {A,B,C,D,E} followed by a space, then a number in inclusive range[0,100].  Output Print 5 lines, one for each subject A,B,C,D, and E respectively. In each line print in ascending order the marks that are over-given for that subject. If for a subject none of the marks are over-given then print "Nothing Unusual" (without quotes) in that line.

Sherlock has fallen in love with Irene Addler(The Woman), now he wants to impress her. Irene wants to see how clever he actually is. She asks Moriarty to give her some problem. Moriarty designs the problems as follows: Given two number N and M as input find numbers such as: 1. The number should contain all the digits from 0 to N-1 2. The length of number can be atmost M i.e. it can have atmost M digits. 3. The difference between each adjacent digits should be one. calculate the number of all such numbers. Sherlock had no idea to solve this problem help him and prove you are better than him!! For e.g. 1. if N=7 and M=8, you are supposed to use all the 0 to 6 digits and the length of the number can be atmost 8 digits. So, possible solutions are 6543210, 65432101, 56543210, 10123456. So, ans is 4. Note: The numbers starting with 0 will be treated as if 0 have been removed from starting, for the above solution 0123456 will be considered as 123456(the length is 6 not 7) only and as 0 is not appearing in the number, it is not a valid solution   Input  First line T : no. of test cases For each test case:  N M (space separated)   Output For each test case no. of such numbers that can be formed using all 0-(N-1) digits and which have atmost M digits in single line. Output should be in Modulo 1000000007   Constraints 0 ≤ t ≤ 100 2 ≤ N ≤ 10 0 ≤ M ≤ 500  Example Input: 4 2 4 5 5 3 6 7 14  Output: 3 1 18 1639  Explaination Test case 1: N=2 means 0 and 1 both has to be used only and M = 4 means at most 4 times these digits can be used. So, possible solutions are 10,101,1010 (3) //01 is not such a number Test Case 2:  N=5 (0-4), M=5 43210 is only possible solution by using all the digit.

Given is an undirected weighted graph with n vertices and m edges. There may be self loops and/or multiple edges in the graph.  A u-v walk is defined as a sequence of vertices starting at u and ending at v, where consecutive vertices in the sequence are adjacent vertices in the graph i.e. consecutive vertices are connected by some edge.   An arbitary walk of length k+1 is, V1,E1,V2,E2,V3,...,Vk,Ek,V(k+1). where Vi and V(i+1) are connected by edge Ei with weigth Ci.   In simpler informal words, walk is a path in a graph with no restriction on the number of times you can visit a vertex or edge.  For such walk we define magic to be, magic(walk) = (C1 & C2) ^ (C2 & C3) ^ ... ^ (C(k-1) & C(k)) if k ≥ 2 magic(walk) = 0 if k < 2  Note: Here Ci (1 <= i <= k) are the corresponding edge weights.   We love magic, don't we? Hence we always want to maximize it. But for a given graph, there are infinite different walks possible. So, you need to think smart and write a program which prints the maximum magic which can be achieved for some walk in the given graph.   Here, ' & ' is Binary AND Operator, ' ^ ' is Binary XOR Operator.   Input First line contains two integers n and m. Next m lines, each contain three space separated integers u,v and c denoting an undirected edge in graph between vertices u and v with weight c.  Output Print the maximum magic that can be achieved for some walk in the graph.  Constraints  1 <= n <= 100 1 <= m <= 150 0 <= c <= 100 1 <= u,v <= n   Sample Input 1: 2 1 1 2 5 Sample Output 1: 5  Explanation: Let the walk be 1->2->1 For this walk, magic = (5 & 5) = 5  Sample Input 2: 4 4 1 2 1 2 4 3 3 1 4 4 3 2  Sample Output 2: 7  Explanation: Number the 4 vertices in input as 1,2,3,4. Number the 4 edges in input as a,b,c,d. Let weight of any edge x be |x|. For walk = {1,c,3,c,1,a,2,b,4,d,3} magic = (|c| & |c|) ^ (|c| & |a|) ^ (|a| ^ |b|) ^ (|b| ^ |d|)   It can be proven that 7 is maximum value magic can take for this input. 
 Ramanujan is a Mathematician. One day when he was looking for a book in library, he came across a book named Formule Di Matematica. He found it interesting and started reading it. While going through the book, he found a function D which was as following: D(< a1,a2,a3,..,an >) = |a1-a2| + |a2-a3| + ... +|an-1-an| where < a1,a2,a3,...,an > is a sequence of n distinct integers.Ramanujan quickly understood that the value of D would depend upon the order of integers, hence he was then interested in finding out what could possibly be the maximum value of D, given a set of Integers S. It's given that, S = set of all possible permutation you can make with n different integers and the range of integers would be [1...n]. Now help Ramanujan to find the maximum value of D which can be obtained, if he tries each and every permutation from the set S as an argument for D.  Input:  There will be T ≤ 10^5 test cases. For each case there is a single line. First line contains an integer 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 which specifies the number of distinct integers. The integers are in the range [1..n].   Output: For each test case you have to output the required answer in a single line.The output will fit in 64-bit signed integer.   Example:  Input: 2 1 2  Output: 0 1 
 Alice and Bob are a paranoic couple who wants to hold a remote conversation using a chat client. However, they do not like the existent ones (e.g. gtalk, MSN, Facebook chat, etc.), as they think that there might be hidden backdoors in them that allows spies to read their conversations about their never ending love.  Last week, they decided to build their unique chat client, called ABmod, which will encode their messages using a symmetric approach. First, Alice and Bob will choose a public prime integer P and exchange a private key composed of two integers A and B, here 0 ≤ A,B < P. To encode a message X they will apply the following function: f(X) = (A x X + B) mod P  where C mod M is the remainder of dividing C between M. This operator satisfy the following properties (among others not mentioned here):  (A + B) mod M = ((A mod M) + (B mod M)) mod M (A x B) mod M = ((A mod M) x (B mod M)) mod M   Eve is in a crush for Bob and wants to spy and interfere his conversation with Alice. To do this, Eve managed to intercept N messages in their plain and encoded forms. Now, she wants to deduce the private key (A,B) to send fake encoded messages to Alice pretending she is Bob. However, she has no idea of how to do it, so she is asking for your help in this task.  Input  The first line contains an integer T, which specifies the number of test cases. Then, T test case descriptions will follow.  Each test case will start with a line with two positive integers, N and P, whose meanings were described previously. The next N lines will contain each 2 integers Xi and Yi, which represents an intercepted message whose plain form is Xi and encoded form is Yi.  Output  For each input case you must print the string "Case #i: ", where i is the test case number, starting from 1, followed by the number A and B that compose the private key. If there multiple valid keys, print "MULTIPLE SOLUTIONS" instead. If there are no valid keys, print "NO SOLUTIONS" instead.  Example  Input 4 2 5 3 0 1 4 1 13 0 12 2 2 0 0 0 1 4 97 0 13 1 46 2 79 3 15  Output Case #1: 3 1 Case #2: MULTIPLE SOLUTIONS Case #3: NO SOLUTIONS Case #4: 33 13   Constraints   T will be between 1 and 1000, inclusive. P will be a prime number. P will be between 2 and 10^6, inclusive. N will be between 1 and 100, inclusive. Xi and Yi will be between 0 and P-1, inclusive, for all i between 1 and N, inclusive.

   Problem description One of the Engineer friends of John, Mr. Dev tried to develop an encryption algorithm which can send strings of words wirelessly between two devices connected through Wi-Fi. On completing the design of algorithm, John decides to test his algorithm on real devices. To test his algorithm on device, Dev sends some strings from one device to another. On matching the strings that were send and receive he found out some problems as mentioned below:- 1.In a word somehow some alphabets are changed from lowercase to uppercase and from uppercase to lowercase. 2. Before, after or in between the alphabets of a word, sometimes one or more number of consonants, vowels or numbers (1 to 9) were added. 3. Some vowels or consonants are changed to any other alphabet. But no two consecutive vowels or consonants are changed in a word. Now Dev wants to find out the efficiency of his algorithm. But before that he wanted to know the minimum number of edits needed to transform the received string into sent string. Dev decides to ignore 1st problem in calculating the number of edits. An edit is defined as either a deletion or substitution of a single alphabet.    Input First line of input will be s, no of test strings. For each test string, the next two lines contains two strings, first  string will be original string that was sent by the sender device(i.e. the correct string) and the second string is the received string that was received by the receiver device(i.e the test strings in which you need to find the minimum number of edits w.r.t. the first string).   Output For each test string output a single positive number that will be the number of edits calculated in that string.  Constraints  0 ≤ s ≤ 100 Length of any String <= 500     Example Input: 2 He is a good programmer hp is a pool Probgrammer Program prpgreamp  Output: 4 3    Explanation For first string received, 4 edits need to be done (substituting ‘p’ to ‘e’ in ‘hp’, substituting ‘p’ to ‘g’ in ‘pool’, substituting ‘l’ to ‘d’ in ‘pool’ and removing extra ‘b’ in ‘probgrammer’) to transform the received string into sent string. For second string received, 3 edits need to be done (removing ‘r’, substituting ‘p’ to ‘o’, removing ‘e’ and removing ‘p’ in ‘prpgreamp’) to transform the received string into sent string.

   Little Pratya loves collecting candies and she also likes playing games :). Today Pratya is travelling in bus and she has a bag full of N candies. She looks outside the window and notices milestones with numbers written on them. She decides to play a game. She wants to select some initial non-zero number of candies from the bag and call it her collection of candies. When she sees a milestone on the way, she will add or remove some candies from her collection as following.  Let the previous milestone number be a1 and the current milestone number be a2.         a2 > a1 :   Pratya adds ( a2 - a1 ) candies to her collection (thus, her bag of candies loses them). If the bag doesn't contain  at least ( a2 - a1 ) candies, she starts crying.  a2 < a1 :  Pratya removes ( a1 - a2 ) candies from her collection (thus, her bag of candies gains them). If her collection doesn't contain  more than ( a1 - a2 ) candies, she starts crying.  a1 = a2 :  Pratya is bored to see the same number again and so she eats one of the candies from her collection.  Moreover, Pratya always wants her candy collection to have at least one candy, otherwise she starts crying. Given the numbers written on all the milestones in order, find the minimum number of candies Pratya should select in the beginning so that she doesn't have to cry at all.  If it is not possible , print -1. Note that no change to the collection happens when she sees the first milestone.  Input The first line contain the number of test cases T. Each test case has two lines. The first line specifies N and M. N is the number of candies in the bag and M is the total number of milestones. Second line contains M integers, the numbers written on the milestones, in the order Pratya sees them. ^ is used for power. T <= 150 1 <= N <= 10^7 2 <= M <= 10^4 Each milestone number will be between [-10^6,10^6].  Output For each test case output the minimum number of candies that should be selected from the bag or -1 if its not possible  Example  Input: 3 10 5 1 5 1 -1 -2 2 5 1 5 1 -1 -2 100 3 1 2 3  Output: 4 -1 1   * There are multiple test sets, and the judge shows the sum of the time taken over all test sets of your submission, if Accepted. 
 Problem  			Infinite army of minions are racing on an infinite 2-D plane.  			Here's how they race:  			Each minion chooses exactly one x coordinate and races along it in positive y direction, 			starting from (x, 0). There exists exactly one minion for each x coordinate on that plane and hence there are infinite minions!  			There are N horizontal barriers lying on this plane. The ith barrier is defined by (xi, yi) and di, which means that the barrier is blocking all minions which want to pass through points lying on line segment connecting (xi, yi) and (xi + di, yi). Once a minion encounters a barrier, it stops moving.  			Given all the barriers, your task is to find the total number of minions that will be blocked at some point in their race.  Input  			The first line contains an integer N which denotes the number of barriers. Next N lines follow, each contains 3 space separated integers, "xi yi di" as explained in problem statement above.  Note: The barriers in the input may overlap.   Output  			Output a single integer, the number of MINIONS that will be blocked at some point in their race.   Constraints   					1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5     					1 ≤ xi, yi, di ≤ 10^9    Sample Input  2 1 1 4 7 3 5   Sample Output 11  Explanation  			Here 5 Minions will be blocked on points (1, 1), (2, 1) , (3, 1), (4, 1) and (5, 1). 			6 Minions will be blocked on (7, 3), (8, 3), (9, 3), (10, 3), (11, 3), (12, 3). 			In total, 11 minions are blocked in their race.   p { text-align:justify } 
 ACM International Collegiate     Programming Contest, Asia-Amritapuri Site, 2012 Wormtongue's Mind  Wormtongue looked from face to face. In his eyes was the hunted look of a beast seeking some gap in the ring of his enemies.     'Nay, Eomer, you do not fully understand the mind of Master Wormtongue,' said Gandalf, turning his piercing glance upon him. 'He is bold and cunning.     Even now he plays a game with peril and wins a throw.' - Gandalf, trying to figure out Wormtongue's mind.  In fact, Wormtongue's mind is a complicated system of evaluating various variables and parameters. In essence, each parameter is a uniform random floating point variable between 0 and 1 (inclusive). Further, his mind works on calculating best and worst-case values, which are equivalent to min/max of 2 expressions.  For example, right now Wormtongue is calculating : 'Chances of escaping' = max('Theoden letting me go', 'Me killing everyone') 'Theoden letting me go' = max('Theoden is forgiving by nature', 'Gandalf advises him to let me go'). 'Me killing everyone' = min('Me killing Gandalf', 'Me killing Theoden').  So, you are given an expression consisting of independent uniform [0, 1] random variables, on which you have an expression consisting of "min", and "max" alone. Help Gandalf figure out Wormtongue's mind by finding the expected value of this expression.  Input (STDIN):  The first line contains T, the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a single line describing the expression. The characters of the string are derived from the set {'M','m','x'}, where 'M' stands for max, 'm' stands for min, and 'x' is a random variable Formally, in the expression tree, each node which asks for max is labeled as 'M', each node which asks for min is labelled 'm', and all the leaves are labeled 'x'. The description of the expression is preorder traversal of this tree. For example, Mxmxx describes the expression max(x1, min(x2, x3)).  Output (STDOUT):  For each test case, output one line which contains the expected value of the expression. The results should be accurate within an error range of 10^-6.  Constraints: 1 <= T <= 1,000 1 <= input string length <= 100  Sample Input:   4 x mxx Mxx MmxxMxx  Sample Output:   0.500000 0.333333 0.666667 0.700000  Notes/Explanation of Sample Input:  For the first test case, it asks for the mean of a random number between 0 and 1, which is 0.5.  Note: It is recommended to use long long and long double data types in calculation to avoid precision errors.

 Alice,the Nightingale of Musicland is going to represent her country in World Music Finals. The Rules for the World Music Finals are : 1. The Contestant will sing exactly 2 songs in the competition. 2. The original singers of both the songs selected by the contestant should be different. Alice has a large collection of N songs ( numbered from 1 to N ). However, She does not directly know the original singer of each song. Although, She knows M pairs of songs which was sung by the same singer. She wants to calculate the total number of ways of selecting 2 songs for the World Finals such that it does not violate the Rules of the competition. As Alice is not good at maths she asks you to help her. Note: * Alice knows enough pairs to identify the group of songs although she does not know the exact original singers of the songs. * If the songs 1,2,3,4 was sung by the same Original singer, then the pair (1,2),(2,3),(3,4) are sufficient to describe the same group without mentioning the groups (1,3),(2,4),(1,4) explicitly.   Input  The first line contains two space separated integers N and M.  Each of the following M lines contains a space seperated integer pair A B, where A and B are the songs sung by the same Original singer.   Output The total number of ways of selecting a pair of songs that satisfy the World Finals Rules.

 Recommending systems are very popular now.Many commercial websites use it to recommend items to their users.Sometimes merging preferences is a difficult task because different users have different preferences. A user's preference is a linear order of items. For example there are 3 items, namely 1,2,3 and 3 users. The first user prefers item 1 to item 2 and prefers item 2 to item 3. So his/her preference is 1 2 3. The second user's preference is 2 1 3. And the third user's preference is 3 2 1. How can we merge the 3 preferences? If we merge them to get a preference P we can calculate the badness of it. It can be defined as the total number of pairs that Disobey in all the linear orders.  So the badness of 1 2 3 is 0 + 1 + 3 = 4 because  1 2 disobeys the second preference and all the 3 pairs  disobey the third preference. The badness of 1 3 2 is 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. The badness of 2 1 3 is 1 + 0 + 2 = 3. The badness of 2 3 1 is 2 + 1 + 1 = 4. The badness of 3 1 2 is 2 + 3 + 1 = 6. The badness of 3 2 1 is 3 + 2 + 0 = 5.  So if we let P = 2 1 3 , the minimal badness is 3.   Input  Given N users preferences of M items, calculate the minimal badness of merged preference. The first line of input is 2 integers, N  and M . Each of the next n lines is a permutation of integers from 1 to M.  Output  Just output the minimal badness of merged preference in a single line.  Example  Input: 3 3 1 2 3 2 1 3 3 2 1  Output: 3   Constraints   0 < N < 21  0 < M < 10001

Mech Project  	A Team of Mech guys from UVCE are working on a Robot, which can cut the ripen coconut from the tree by controlling the release of enzymes in the tree. Team somehow manages to get the Size and ripeFactor of each coconut. If Size of the coconut is strictly greater than minSize or ripeFactor is strictly greater than minRipeFactor then enzymes will be controlled to cut that coconut, else it will not be cut.   	The team wants to analyse the efficiency of their Robot. In a tree if the Robot cuts RCut coconuts but actually it was required to cut ACut coconuts, then efficiency of the Robot will be RCut ÷ ACut. Write a program to calculate the efficiency of the Robot.  Input  First line contains T,number of test cases. In each test case First line contains 3 space separated integers N (number of coconuts in the tree), minSize and minRipeFactor. In next N lines i th line contains two space separated integers Size and ripeFactor of i th coconut. Next line contains single integer ACut.   Output  For each test case print the simplified fraction of RCut/ACut. For clarity refer to the Sample Inputs and Outputs.   Constrains 1 <= T <= 10 1 <= N <= 10^5 0 <= Size, ripeFactor, minSize, minRipeFactor <= 10^9 1 <= ACut <= N  Sample Input  1 5 5 150 1 120 7 133 3 153 5 100 2 150 4  Sample Output  1/2  Explanation Robot will cut RCut = 2 coconuts, it was actually required to cut ACut = 4 coconuts, so ACut/RCut is 2/4, and simplified ratio is 1/2 
    Larry graduated this year and finally has a job.  Hes making a lot of money, but somehow never seems to have enough.  Larry has decided that he needs to grab hold of his financial portfolio and solve his financing problems. The first step is to figure out whats been going on with his money.  Larry has his bank account statements and wants to see how much money he has.  Help Larry by writing a program to take his closing balance from each of the past twelve months and calculate his average account  balance.     Input   The input will be twelve lines. Each line will contain the closing balance of his bank account for a particular month.  Each number will be positive and displayed to the penny. No dollar sign will be included.   Output   The output will be a single number, the average (mean) of the closing balances for the twelve months.  It will be rounded to the nearest penny, preceded immediately by a dollar sign, and followed by the end-of-line.  There will be no other spaces or characters in the output.     Example   Input:    100.00  489.12  12454.12  1234.10  823.05  109.20  5.27  1542.25  839.18  83.99  1295.01  1.75    Output:    $1581.42  
   The expression N!, read as "N factorial," denotes the product of the first N positive integers, where N is nonnegative. So, for example,     N       N!   0       1   1       1   2       2   3       6   4      24   5     120  10 3628800    For this problem, you are to write a program that can compute the last non-zero digit of any factorial for (0 ≤ N ≤ 10000). For example, if your program is asked to compute the last nonzero digit of 5!, your program should produce "2" because 5! = 120, and 2 is the last nonzero digit of 120.     Input   The input will consist of a sequence of integers. The sequence will be followed by Zero.   Output   For each integer input, the program should print exactly one line of output which must be the single last non-zero digit of N!.   Example   Input:    1  2  26  125  3125  9999    Output:    1  2  4  8  2  8     
  Run, Run, Runaround Numbers  An N-digit runaround number is characterized as follows:        * It is an integer with exactly N digits, each of which is between 1 and 9, inclusively.      * The digits form a sequence with each digit telling where the next digit in the sequence occurs. This is done by giving the number of digits to the right of the digit where the next digit in the sequence occurs. If necessary, counting wraps around from the rightmost digit back to the leftmost.      * The leftmost digit in the number is the first digit in the sequence, and the sequence must return to this digit after all digits in the number have been used exactly once.      * No digit will appear more than once in the number. This rule was accidentally left out of the problem description at the competition.    For example, consider the number 81362. To verify that this is a runaround number, we use the steps shown below:        1. Start with the leftmost digit, 8        8 1 3 6 2       -     2. Count 8 digits to the right, ending on 6 (note the wraparound).        8 1 3 6 2       -     -     3. Count 6 digits to the right, ending on 2.        8 1 3 6 2       -     - -     4.

  One day maths teacher gave the following task for the students, only upon completion students will be taken out for a school fun trip. First you are a given a list of n numbers and q queries. For each query you are given two indices x and y , you have to report the between the maximum number and minimum number whose indices lie within x and y (both inclusive)     Input First line of input has two integers n and q , denoting the size of list and number of queries Next line consists of n spaced integers denoting the elements of the array Next q lines consists of two integer x and y , denoting the leftmost and rightmost indices of the query  Note : List is 0-indexed   Output For each query , print the answer in a new line.  Constraints 0< n,q < 100000 0< element of list < 1000000000 0 < x,y < n  Example Input: 5 2 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 4 4   Output: 1 0   Explanation Example case .  First query maximum number in given range is 3 and minimum number is 2 so difference 1  Second Query maximum and mimimum both are 5 ,difference is 0 
  You must be aware of the sorting technique, called merge sort where we sort an input array by first dividing it into two halves, and then sorting the each half recursively before finally merging these sorted halves. A GEU student, Mohan want to understand this recursive algorithm more clearly and is interested to know how the recursive function calls are getting called during the merge sort program execution for the given input parameters - input array (A), begin index (s) and the end index (t).   When the function merge_sort(A,s,t) is called, the recursive functions calls would be executed as per the input parameters. Mohan is interested to take a snapshot of the function calling stack when merge_sort(A,i,i) is being executed, where s <= i <= t. Mohan also wants to know the recursive function depth at that point of time. Assume that, if the input array consists of odd number of elements then it is divide in such a way that the left half contains one element more than the right half.  Input The first line of input contains T, the number of test cases. T lines follow, each line containing three values corresponding to s, t and i.    Output For each test case, output in separate lines, the begin and end index input parameters of the merge_sort() that would have been called till it reaches sorting ith index element. Mention these in same sequence as the function calls were called, and also then include in the next line the recursive function depth at that time. Return -1 if it could not have been called.  weL and R (separated by a space) X times, where X is the number of calls made to the function mergeSort(). For each call print L and R in a new line. Post that print  the heightest height achieved by the stack after all calls to the function mergeSort() has has been made.    Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 1000 1 ≤ t ,i  ≤ 1000 0 ≤ s ≤ 1000     Example Input: 4 0 4 3 7 15 14 1 16 9 7 14 3   Output: 0 4 3 4 3 3 3 7 15 12 15 14 15 14 14 4 1 16 9 16 9 12 9 10 9 9 5 -1    Explanation for first test case If we take the snapshot of the function calling stack  when merge_sort(A,3,3) would have been called during the execution of merge_sort(A,0,4),  then there would be seen - the  function merge_sort(A,0,4) calling merge_sort(A,3,4), which would then be calling merge_sort(A,3,3). So, in this case, the recursive depth would be 3.

 Problem description. Alice and Bob are being held at Azkaban(Prison). They want to escape and join Dumbledore's Army. Alice wants to tell Bob about the details of the plan but wants to keep their escape plan from Dementors(the guards). So Alice encrypts the message before passing the chits to Bob's cell. However Bob was careless and he disposed the chits in his cell's waste paper bin. The clever Dementor found the chits but couldn't make out what they said. So he hired a computer programmer to decode the message for him. Please help the Dementor to decypher the message. The code key that Alice used for this simple coding is a one for one character substitution based upon a single arithmetic manipulation of the printable portion of the ASCII character set.   Input The Encrypted message in a single line. The maximum number of charaters in a message is 100. (DO NOT PRINT ANY PROMPT MESSAGE TO ENTER THE ENCRYPTED MESSAGE.)   Output The decrypted message in a single line. (Do not print any other message other than the decrypted message.)  Example SAMPLE INPUT 1 [YHUZMVYT'[V'HUPTHN\Z'MVYT3   SAMPLE OUTPUT 1 TRANSFORM TO ANIMAGUS FORM,    SAMPLE INPUT 2 HUK'LZJHWL'^OLU'[OL`'IYPUN'MVVK5    SAMPLE OUTPUT 2 AND ESCAPE WHEN THEY BRING FOOD.  
 Problem description.  Blackjack is a very well known gambling card game played against a dealer in a casino. In this card game, each player is trying to beat the dealer, by obtaining a sum of card values not more than 21 which is greater than the sum of dealer card values. Player is initially given 2 cards, but he could choose to HIT (ask for 3rd card) or STAND (no more cards). If he chooses to hit for 3rd card and total score crosses 21 he get busted (loses irrespective of the total score of dealer cards). Face cards (Jacks, Queens and Kings) are worth 10 points. Aces are worth 1 or 11, whichever is preferable. Other cards are represented by their number. Here, you have to implement a conservative player strategy of playing blackjack. This conservative player does not want to get busted and hit only when its safe to do so. He follows following strategy: HIT if (score<=11) or (an ACE is held) STAND otherwise. Write a program to implement the above strategy given the initial 2 cards of the player.   Input First line T, will have a single integer having number of test cases followed by T lines of input.  Second Line will have two space seperated inputs (value of first and second card).  and so on..  Output For each test case, output a single line containing the result.  Constraints  1) Color of the card does not affects the score of the card.  2) If the value of card is not valid then return INVALID.  3) Don't consider the card with value 10(print INVALID).  4) Input for Face cards must be capital letters('A','Q','J','K') else return INVALID.    Example Input 3 J 5 4 3 A F   Output: STAND HIT INVALID   Explanation 1. Here the value of J (JACK) is 10. so the sum of card values is 15, so he chooses to stand.  2. Here the sum of values of card 4 and 3 is 7. It is less than 11, so it makes sense for him to draw another card.  3. Here F is an invalid card name.  
Smugglers are becoming very smart day by day. They use SMS to communicate with each other. Police can often intercept their messages and bust them. Now they have developed a new technique of sending their messages from one smuggler to another. In their new technology, they are sending their messages in a number format. This format represents the way that numbers and characters are padded on mobile’s keypad. One smuggler sends a text message to the second smuggler, using the numbers corresponding to the letters on the keypad. When the receiving smuggler gets the message, he simply opens the “create text message” function in his mobile and types the number string. This way the receiver finally reads the original message.   1 2ABC 3DEF   4GHI 5JKL 6MNO   7PQRS 8TUV 9WXYZ   * 0[SPACE] #    For Example: 6999066263304447777077766622337778 -----> message sent by the first smuggler. my name is robert---------> message decoded by the second smuggler. Where ‘0’ denotes the "space". But for word monkey 6#666#665533999 this string will be sent by the smuggler one Here ‘# ‘ denotes that if smuggler watches ‘#’ then it means character previous to # is on the same key to the character after the ‘#’ and smuggler has to wait for 2 seconds and then press the same key.  You have to make a program  that takes as input a numerically coded string as message and outputs decoded message.  Constraints  Smuggler can never send numbers in message text Output will always be in uppercase  Input First line T, will have a single integer having number of test cases followed by T lines of input each having CODED message send by smuggler 1.  Output For each test case, output a single line containing the message smuggler 2 will get after decoding.  Example  Input: 2 6999066263304447777077766622337778 6#666#665533999  Output: MY NAME IS ROBERT MONKEY  Explanation: By pressing ‘6’ (i.e. key’6’ one time) on the keypad, the mobile shows ‘m’ on display screen in write text message area. By pressing ‘999’ (i.e. key ‘9’ three times) on the keypad, the mobile shows ‘y’ on display screen in write text message area.

  The Army Headquarters of the northern command had confidential message to be sent to the headquarters of the southern base. They devised an algorithm to encrypt the message. The message was encrypted using the following algorithm: After every word, there is a number X associated with it, which is less than the length of the word. First, the string before position X is reversed.  Then, the Z-transform (as explained below) is performed on every character of the remaining string. Definition of Z-transform: The Z-transform of character x is computed as follows. If the alphabet, x comes at position i in English Vocabulary, the Z-transform of x is (26-i+1)^th alphabet. For example, the Z-transform of A is Z, the Z-transform of B is Y, Z-transform of C is X, the Z-transform of Z is A, etc. Your task is to encrypt a given word of the message. It is also given that all the characters in the string are upper case English alphabets.    Input The first line of input contains T, the number of test cases. T lines follow, each consisting of a string space separated by the number X.  Output For each test case output the encrypted text.    Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 1000 1 ≤ length of input string ≤ 100 0 ≤ X ≤ length of input string     Example Input: 2 SEND 2 BACKUP 2  Output: ESMW ABXPFK   
Chef Ceil has some matchsticks in his kitchen. Detail of matchsticks: There are N matchsticks in total. They are numbered from to 0 to N-1 inclusive. All matchsticks have same length. But they may have different rates of burning. For i^th matchstick, we denote bi as the time required for that matchstick to completely burn-down if lighted at one end.  The matchsticks have uniform rate of burning. If lighted at both ends simultaneously, the matchstick will take only half of the original time to burn down. Arrangement: He ties rear end of the all the matchsticks together at one point and the front end is kept free. The matchstick numbered i is adjacent to matchstick numbered i+1 for all 0<= i <=N-2. Bodies of matchsticks do not touch each other, except at rear end. All matchsticks are kept on the floor. Task: There are Q queries, in each query we ask: If he lights the free end of all matchsticks numbered between  L and R both inclusive, what will be the time needed for all matchsticks to get completely burnt.  Input First line of input contains one integer N, total number of matchsticks. The next line contains N space separated integers bi, where bi is the time required for i^th matchstick to completely burn-down if lighted at one end. Next line contains one integer Q, total number of queries you need to answer. Then there are Q queries in next Q lines. Each line has two space separated integers L and R.  Output Print Q lines, one for each query, printing the answer for each query, that is, the time it will take for all the matchsticks  to get completely burn down. Every time you must print your answer with 1 decimal place.  Constraints: 1 <= N <= 10^5 1<= bi <= 10^8 1 <= Q <= 10^5 0 <= L <= R <= N-1   Example   Input 1 5 1 0 0 Output 5.0  Input 2 3 5 1 0 1 Output 4.0  Input 18 3 4 2 1 5 7 9 7 10 5 12 3 1 1 2 1 3 2 1 4 10 Output 9.0   Explanation  For the last input, in figure yellow colored matches are lighted by a lighter simultaneously. The numbers indicate the time required to burn that matchstick (if lighted at one end) Now the first lighted matchstick will completely burn in 5 seconds. Then it will light up all the rest matches from the rear end. Some matches will have fire at both ends and thus after 5 seconds, they will start burning with twice the original rate. Thus time taken for matches to burn completely will be : (from left to right):  8.0, 9.0, 7.0, 6.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 6.0, 7.5, 5.0, 8.5, 8.0, 6.0, 6.0, 7.0, 6.0, 8.0, 7.0. So, the answer will be 9.0 (the maximum among these). 
 ACM International Collegiate     Programming Contest, Asia-Amritapuri Site, 2012 The Mirror of Galadriel  With water from the stream Galadriel filled the basin to the brim, and breathed on it, and when the water was still again she spoke.     'Here is the Mirror of Galadriel,' she said. 'I have brought you here so that you may look in it, if you will. For this is what your folk would call magic,     I believe; though I do not understand clearly what they mean; and they seem also to use the same word of the deceits of the Enemy.     But this, if you will, is the magic of Galadriel. Did you not say that you wished to see Elf-magic?' - Galadriel to Frodo and Sam, describing her Mirror.  We call a string S magical if every substring of S appears in Galadriel's Mirror (under lateral inversion). In other words, a magical string is a string where every substring has its reverse in the string.  Given a string S, determine if it is magical or not.  Input (STDIN):  The first line contains T, the number of test cases. The next T lines contain a string each.  Output (STDOUT):  For each test case, output "YES" if the string is magical, and "NO" otherwise.  Constraints:  1 <= T <= 100 1 <= |S| <= 10 S contains only lower-case characters.  Sample Input:   2 aba ab  Sample Output:   YES NO  Notes/Explanation of Sample Input:   For the first test case, the list of substrings are : a, b, ab, ba, aba. The reverse of each of these strings is present as a substring of S too. For the second test case, the list of substring are : a, b, ab. The reverse of "ab", which is "ba" is not present as a substring of the string. 
You are given integers N,K and M and operation F. Operation F is defined for an integer as follows:  F:  for i from 1 to M inclusive, do 	if N is a multiple of K, 		divide N by K 	else, 		multiply N by K print N Perform the operation F on N.    Input The first line contains a single integer T the number of test cases. T lines follow each of them consists 3 space-separated integers N K M on a single line.    Output The output must consist of T lines the result obtained on performing operation F on N.    Constraints 1<=T<=40,000 1<=N<=10^9 1<=K<=10^4 1<=M<=10^10    Example Input: 2 42 3 2 6 7 1  Output: 42 42     Explanation Since 42 is divisible by 3, it is divided by 3 and 14 is obtained. Since 14 is not divisible by 3, it is multiplied by 3. Hence, 42 is obtained. 
  Rohit was travelling to NIT Warangal, to attend their annual technical fest - "Technozion". In the train, opposite to him, Rohit found quite a peculiar man playing with an array of numbers. When he enquired, the man told that he is trying to solve a puzzle for decades but unable to do so. Seeing Rohit's interest in the puzzle, the man decided to challenge him to solve it, in return of which he would pay Rohits return fare. Rohit got excited and decided to solve it but requires your help. Help him solve the puzzle which is as follows -     You are given an array of size N ( 1-based indexing ) , filled with positive integers not necessarily distinct. You are now asked to play a game on it. For the first step any number (except the first number) can be chosen. At each step of the game, you have to select a number whose index is the multiple of any one of the indices of previously selected numbers. You have to maximise the sum of all the numbers that you can choose using the rule mentioned. You can leave the game with current sum at any time or continue to play till it is possible to choose a number. Ofcourse, you have to choose optimised indices to get the maximum sum. You cant choose an index twice     Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the size of the array . The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the elements of the array.    Output For each test case, output a single line containing the maximum sum possible following the rules of the game.    Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 2 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 0 ≤ Ai≤ 10^9     Example Input: 1 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  Output: 20    Explanation Rohit found out that the maximum sum possible in the given test case is 20. 
Arif is very intelligent boy and also good at mathematics. One day his Mathematics Teacher asked him to find the product of two polynomial expressions.

Our new era superhero JAGGI is fighting to save the world, he has to find and kill mutants who live in random houses within a straight street. Since we live in a modern world, the mutants of this world are very smart and no one knows in which house they live. In fact, even they don’t know where the other mutants live but they do have some kind of pattern according to which they choose their respective house numbers. Fortunately, JAGGI is aware of this pattern which says that the address of the next mutant can be found by killing the previous three mutants and adding their respective house addresses. JAGGI has started working and has already found the address of the first three villains of the street: Address 0, Address 1 and Address 2. But JAGGI doesn’t want to hurt anyone except the mutants, so he has to be sure and wants to find the address of all the houses where the mutants live. He randomly decides to choose a house number and asks you whether a mutant lives there or not. Help him by answering his query in the form: YES or NO. INPUT The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. For each test case there will be a single integer which represents the house number.  OUTPUT   For each test case, output will be YES if the mutant lives in that house otherwise the output will be NO. CONSTRAINTS 1 <= T <= 10^5 1 <= K <= 10^18  Example Input   3 1 5 6 Output YES NO YES Problem Set By: Gaurav Dubey, 3rd Year

  Naman has decided to go to a temple today. The path to this unique temple has exactly N steps with each step having a number A associated with it. The value of A-1 for a particular step denotes the maximum number of steps that one can skip and reach the A^th step from the current position. But in doing so, energy is reduced drastically. Suppose Naman goes from step J1 to step J2 and  the numbers associated with these 2 steps are A1 and A2 respectively, the amount by which Naman's energy decreases is  (A2-A1). Help Naman find the minimum starting energy so that he can reach the top of the temple.  Input : First line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. First line of every test case contains an integer N denoting the number of steps. The second line contains N space separated integers denoting the numbers associated with each step.  Output : For each test case, print the required result in a single line.  Constraints : 1 ≤ T*N ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ Ai ≤ 10^5  Example : Input: 1 2 1  6 Output: 5  Explanation : Naman's energy decreases by 5 when going from step 1 to 2. Therefore minimum energy required is 5.

To test a new cloud computing service, you decide to write a program that generates the Pascal Triangle in a distributed fashion. You wish to estimate the amount of network traffic that would be expected between nodes. Since the nodes exchange the computed values in base 10, you want to know the number of digits in the base-10 representation of nth row and rth column of Pascal's triangle. Since your program internally represents these in base-2, you also wish to know the number of digits in the base-2 representation to get an idea of the memory usage involved.  Input Format The first line contains a single integer t, followed by t lines each containing two numbers that indicate the row and column in Pascal's triangle respectively.  Output Format For each test case output a single line containing two numbers each, the number of digits in the base 10 representation followed by the number of digits in base 2.  Example Input:   20 5 2 3 3 5 4 2 2 4 1 5 5 2 1 4 4 3 1 3 0 1 1 2 0 3 2 5 3 4 2 4 0 5 1 4 3 1 0 5 0   Output:  2 4 1 1 1 3 1 1 1 3 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 4 1 3 1 1 1 3 1 3 1 1 1 1  
Galileo's latest project involves determining the density of stars in certain regions of the sky. For this purpose he started looking for datasets online, and discovered a dataset on Newton's blog. Newton had decomposed the night sky into a Voronoi tessellation with the generators arranged in a grid. He has stored the number of stars in a Voronoi cell at a position in a matrix that corresponds to the position of the generator in the grid.  This dataset does not directly help Galileo, because he needs to be able to query the number of stars in a rectangular portion of the sky. Galileo tried to write a program that does this on his own, but it turned out to be too slow. Can you help him?  Input The first line contains two integers n and m that denote the height and width of the matrix respectively. This is followed by n lines each containing m integers each.  The line following this would contain a single integer t, the number of queries to be run. Each query line consists of 4 integers px, py, qx, qy. The first two integers denote the row and column numbers of the upper left corner of the rectangular region, and the second pair of numbers correspond to the lower right corner.  1<= n,m<=1000 1<=t<=100 1<=px,qx,py,qy<=1000  Output For each query output a single line containing the number of stars in that rectangular region.  Example  Input: 3 3 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 3 3 2 1 3 3 3 1 3 3  Output: 10 90 60 30  
Code a thon  is programming a robot that is supposed to paint a horizontal line. Not being one to care much about efficiency, Codesmith programs the robot to move in an anti-clockwise spiral as shown below.     <-- 12 4 3 2 11 5 0 1 10 6 7 8 9  The robot starts at position zero, then moves to position 1, then position 2 and so on. Codesmith wants all of the tiles to the right of 0 to be painted black. (These tiles are represented as bold numbers in the figure above.)  Your task is to help Codesmith by telling him which is the nth tile that must be painted black, with the zeroth tile being zero.  Input The first line of the input contains a single integer n, this is the number of test cases. This is followed by n lines each containing a single integer A.  1<=n<=100 0<=A<=10000  Output For each test case output a single integer which is the number of the tile that corresponds to the nth tile that must be painted.  Example  Input: 3 0 1 2  Output: 0 1 10 
Did you ever hear about 'Dragon Food' ? Its used to refer to the chocolates bought for your loved ones :). Po offers dragon food to master Shifu, who is a famous cook in the valley of food. In return, Shifu hands over the dragon scroll to Po, which is said to hold the ingredients of the secret recipe. To open the dragon scroll, one has to solve the following puzzle.   1. Consider a N-bit integer A. We call an integer A' as shuffle-A, if A' can be obtained by shuffling the bits of A in its binary representation. For eg. if N = 5 and A = 6 = (00110)2, A' can be any 5-bit integer having exactly two 1s in it i.e., any of (00011)2, (00101)2, (00110)2, (01010)2, ...., (11000)2.  2. Given two N-bit integers A and B, find the maximum possible value of (A' xor B') where A' is a shuffle-A, B' is a shuffle-B and xor is the bit-wise xor operator.  Given N, A and B, please help Po in opening the dragon scroll.  Notes 1. xor operator takes two bit strings of equal length and performs the logical XOR operation on each pair of corresponding bits. The result in each position is 1 if only the first bit is 1 OR only the second bit is 1, but will be 0 if both are 1 or both are 0. For eg: 5 (0101) xor 3(0011) = 6(0110). In most languages it is represented using ^ symbol. 5 ^ 3 = 6.  2. If the integer actually needs less than N bits to represent in binary, append sufficient number of leading 0 bits. For eg. as shown in the problem statement for N = 5, A = 6 = (00110)2  Input First line contains an integer T ( number of test cases, around 100 ). T cases follow, each having N A B in a single line, separated by a space. ( 1 <= N <= 30, 0 <= A,B < =1000 )  Output For each case, output the maximum possible value of (shuffle-A xor shuffle-B) in a separate line.  Example  Input: 3 3 5 4 5 0 1 4 3 7  Output: 7 16 14 
 Reversed number is a number written in arabic numerals but the order of digits is reversed. The first digit becomes last and vice versa. For example, if the number is 1245,it will become 5421 .Note that all the leading zeros are omitted. That means if the number ends with a zero, the zero is lost by reversing (e.g. 1200 gives 21). Also note that the reversed number never has any trailing zeros. Your task is to add two reversed numbers and output their reversed sum. Of course, the result is not unique because any particular number is a reversed form of several numbers (e.g. 21 could be 12, 120 or 1200 before reversing). Thus we must assume that no zeros were lost by reversing (e.g. assume that the original number was 12).     Input The input consists of N cases (equal to about 10000). The first line of the input contains only positive integer N. Then follow the cases. Each case consists of exactly one line with two positive integers separated by space. These are the reversed numbers you are to add.   Output For each case, print exactly one line containing only one integer - the reversed sum of two reversed numbers. Omit any leading zeros in the output.   Example  Input: 1 24 1  Output: 34  
 A positive integer is called a palindrome if its representation in the decimal system is the same when read from left to right and from right to left. For a given positive integer K of not more than 5 digits, write the value of the smallest palindrome larger than K to output. Numbers are always displayed without leading zeros.   Input The first line contains integer t, the number of test cases. Integers K are given in the next t lines.   Output For each K, output the smallest palindrome larger than K.   Example  Input: 1 808  Output: 818 
Working from left-to-right if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its left it is called an increasing number; for example, 22344. Similarly if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its right it is called a decreasing number; for example, 774410 we shall call a positive integer that is neither increasing nor decreasing a Invalid number; for example, 155349.WAP to check whether a number is valid or not.   Input The number of test cases have to be specified in the first input(between 1 to 1000).The input consists of one number given as input at a time,the program checks if the number is vaild or not.   Output The output displays whether the number is  vaild or not,i.e it displays valid when the number is Valid and invalid when its not.   Example  Input: 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 150  Output: valid valid valid valid valid valid invalid 
You are given a sequence w of integers. A mismatch is any such pair of neighbouring elements of sequence w[i] and w[i+1], that w[i]>w[i+1]+1. As long as there is any mismatch, you solve it by swapping the mismatching numbers. Given an input sequence, calculate one of the possible output mismatch-less sequences obtained by successively solving mistmatches by swapping.   Input  First - 1<=t<=10 - the number of tests. For each test: first - 1<=n<=100000. Then, n nonnegative integers.   Output For each test, you should output exactly n integers.   Example  Input: 2 4 4 3 2 1 4 4 3 1 2   Output: 4 3 2 1 1 4 3 2

  Alice and Bob is playing a game with stones. There is a NxN grid in each cell there may be a stone or may be empty cell. If a cell contain '.' (without single quotes) it means its an empty cell and if it contains 'S' (it means it has a stone). Alice and Bob alternatively and optimally Play a game The game rules are as follows: 1) A player move some stones from the grid. He / She can remove stones are in connected cells (It means: if a cell at i, j has a stone and i+1,j and  i,j+1 and i-1,j and i,j-1 and so on in a connected manner and having a stone he / she can remove all  stones connected with this I, j cell). 2) Remove stones means He / She will make that cell empty it mean replace ‘S’ with ‘.’ 2) The player that have no stone to remove will lose the game. 3) They will play optimally It means Alice plays first than Bob, than Alice and so on. 4) They will try to remove more stones in a try it means a connected component of the grid that having more stones he / she will remove all stone from that connected set.  Input  First line contains T number of test cases. In each test case First line Contain N. Then NxN grid having  "." or "S"  (without quotes) .   Output  Print the name of Winner either Alice or Bob.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 20 1 ≤ N ≤ 100   Example Input: 2 2 .S SS 3 ..S S.S ..S Output: Alice Bob    Explanation Example case 1. In the first example Alice remove stones from (0,1) cell and (1,0) that is connected with (0,1) diagonally, and also she will remove (1,1) cells stone because it is also connected with (0,1). So Bob has no stones to remove that why he will lose the game and Alice is the Winner. 
 Alice is a very brilliant student. He considers '4' and '7' as Magic numbers. The numbers containing only magic numbers are also magical. Given a magic number N ,he wants to know what could be the next magical number greater than the given number.   Input  First line of input contains number of test cases T. For each test case, there is exits only one line containing a magic number N.   Output  For each test case,  output a single line containing the next greater magical number.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 1000 4 ≤ N ≤ 10^100   Example  Input: 2 4 47  Output: 7 74  
Autobots are instructed by Optimus Prime to mobilize in the form of a rectangular shape with each Autobot on each vertex of the rectangle region on a -”deployment area” (which may consist of one or more regions). This is done so as to take care of the inner rectangular area called “region”. However the rule states-“no two regions may overlap”.  You have been asked to remove some regions from the “deployment area” so the remaining regions do not obscure each other. To keep the disturbance to the minimum level, you should remove the minimum number of regions to achieve this goal. You may not remove a region and place it in another position; all regions you leave in “deployment area” must be in their original position. When you examined the “deployment area”, you noticed something very nice. Every region was placed on the deployment area by placing each autobot in the four corners. This was done in a very courteous manner since each autobot is guarding only the region it is holding. The reason Optimus Prime wants your help because you are good at taking down a single region without disturbing the rest, even if that region is obscured by many others.    Input The first line consists of a single integer T indicating the number of test cases (about 25). Each test case consists begins with a single integer n indicating the number of regions. The next n lines consist of 4 integers x0, x1, y0, and y1 satisfying x0 < x1 and y0 < y1. This means the region covers all points (x,y) satisfying x0 ≤ x ≤ x1 and y0 ≤ y ≤ y1. As stated before hand, no corner of any region will intersect any other region anywhere. That is, if (x,y) is a corner point of one region and another region is described by x0, x1, y0, and y1, then we do not have x0 ≤ x ≤ x1 and y0 ≤ y ≤ y1. Bounds: 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and each integer in a region description fits in a signed 32 bit integer.   Output The output for each test case is a single line containing a single integer that is the maximum number of regions that can be left on the wall such that no two regions share a common point in the deployment area.   Example  Input: 1 4 0 4 0 4 1 3 1 2 2 3 1 3 3 4 1 3 Output: 2 
 There is an unrooted tree, T, with L leaves and N nodes. (Leaves are nodes with degree = 1.)  For every node u, we define its rootScore. To calculate rootScore(u), first root the tree at u (which might be a leaf node).   We also define a coloring procedure for any rooted tree. First remove any existing color from all the nodes. Then select some nodes and apply the colorSubtree function on them. When colorSubtree is called on any node u, it colors the entire subtree of u, including u.  You need to color "exactly" floor(L / 2) of the leaves. So, for any root node u, you will get a set of nodes, S, such that applying colorSubtree on each of its elements will result in exactly floor(L / 2) the leaves to be colored.  Note that such a set always exist because one can always choose any of floor(L / 2) leaves that are not root and put them in S.  rootScore(u) is the minimum cardinality for such a set if u is the root of the tree. What is the minimum rootScore across all the nodes in T?   Input  First line contains N, the number of nodes in tree T. The next N-1 lines contain 2 space separated integers, u and v, each denoting that there is an edge between vertex u and vertex v.  Output Output a single integer, the answer to the problem.  Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 3000  1 ≤ u, v ≤ N   Example Input: 3 2 1 1 3  Output: 1

 Majin has built certain brick towers. The N (1 ≤ N ≤ 25000) towers are conveniently numbered 1..N; tower i has height M_i (1 ≤ M_i ≤ 100000).  He wishes to modify the towers in the following fashion: He has a list of numbers B_1 through B_N (1 ≤ B_i ≤ 100000), and wants to change the tower heights to those heights B_1, ..., B_N in some order (not necessarily the order given or any other order derived from the data).  His strength is obviously, limited. It takes Majin a total X (1 ≤ X ≤ 100) effort per unit height added and Y (1 ≤ Y ≤ 100) effort per unit height reduced.  Majin would like to know the minimum possible total effort of modifying his towers if he picks the best permutation of heights. The answer is guaranteed to fit within a 32-bit signed integer.   Input  The first line has an integer 't' (1 ≤ t ≤ 10), the number of test cases. t cases follow.  Each test case begins with three space-separated integers on a single line: N, X, and Y. N lines follow, each with integers M_i and B_i.   Output  A single integer, the minimum total effort needed to rebuild the towers, for each test case, one per line.   Example  Input: 1 3 6 5 3 1 1 2 1 2  Output: 11  Explanation  Majin's towers have heights 3, 1, and 1. He would like to change them so that their heights are 1, 2, and 2, in some order. It takes 6 units of effort to add a unit of height and 5 to remove a unit of height.  Majin reduces the first tower's height by 1, for an effort of 5 (yielding towers of heights 2, 1, and 1). He then adds one unit of height to the second tower for an effort of 6 (yielding towers of heights 2, 2, and 1).

Find the minimum number of disjoint contiguous subarrays into which original array can be split such that the sum of elements included over all the sub-arrays must be greater than or equal to M. Any element of the original array can be left out and may not be included in one of the disjoint sub-array obtained after splitting.  More formally, if S1, S2, S3.. ,SK are the K disjoint subarrays obtained, then following equation should hold true:-  Sum(S1) + Sum(S2) ... + Sum(SK) ≥ M  There will be multiple queries each containing different values of M. You have to answer such queries as fast as possible. If it is not possible to split in such a way, print "Not Possible" without quotes.  Input   First line of input contains N denoting number of elements in the array Next line contains N space separated integers denoting number of elements in the array.  Next line contains  Q  denoting number of queries.  Each query contains the sum required M   Output   For each query output the required number of disjoint sub-arrays or "Not Possible" (without quotes) if sum cannot be obtained.

 Alice and Bob play the following game. They choose a number N to play with. The rules are as follows :   1) Alice plays first, and the two players alternate.   2) In his/her turn, a player can subtract from N any proper divisor (not equal to N) of N. The number thus obtained is the new N.   3) The person who cannot make a move in his/her turn loses the game.   Assuming both play optimally, who wins the game ?   Input :   The first line contains the number of test cases T. Each of the next T lines contains an integer N.   Output :   Output T lines, one for each test case, containing "ALICE" if Alice wins the game, or "BOB" otherwise.   Sample Input : 2 1 2    Sample Output : BOB ALICE    Constraints : 1 ≤ T ≤ 10000 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000000000    Note : For the first test case, Alice cannot make any move and hence Bob wins the game. For the second test case, Alice subtracts 1 from N. Now, Bob cannot make a move and loses the game.

Little Alice likes to play with her collection of N integers. She knows her collection very well, and often likes to come up with different observations about the numbers. For example, Alice had recently learned that two numbers can be jealous of each other in case they have a non-trivial common divisor (i.e. greater than one divisor). For example, the numbers 8 and 12 are jealous of each other, because they have common divisor 4. But the numbers 8 and 9 aren't jealous of each other, because they don't have any common divisors other than 1. Alice wants to organize a tea-party, and to invite some of the numbers from her collection. She wants to invite as much numbers as possible, in such a way that no two number among the invited are jealous of each other. Please help her to find the maximal amount of numbers she can invite.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the amount of numbers in Alice's collection. The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the numbers from the collection.  Output For each test case, output a single line containing the maximal amount of numbers that can be invited to the tea-party.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^3 1 ≤ Sum of N over all the test cases in a single file ≤ 10^4 1 ≤ Ai ≤ 10^3   Example Input: 2 5 1 2 3 4 5 2 7 7  Output: 4 1  Explanation Example case 1. Alice can invite 1, 2, 3 and 5. This is the maximal set of numbers she can invite. Example case 2. One number will be jealous to the other one, so Alice can invite only one of those. Please note that the numbers are not necessarily different.

It is well known that at Progteam you may enjoy coding with pizza :) However ordering pizzas is not that easy for the Progteam coach. This is because each student may eat a different number of pizza slices, and pizzas of different sizes have different number of slices. When ordering, the coach must ensure that there are enough number of pizza slices so that nobody stay hungry, and also there will be as few leftover slices as possible so that we don't waste food. The coach has collected some information about the number of slices required:  There are SD students who do not like pizza, and each needs 0 slices. There are SH students who are hungry, and each needs 1 slice. There are SV students who are very hungry, and each needs 2 slices. There are SE students who are extremely hungry, and each needs 3 slices.   The nearby restaurant has three types of pizza available:  A small pizza with 4 slices. Each costs PS dollars. A medium pizza with 6 slices. Each costs PM dollars. A large pizza with 8 slices. Each costs PL dollars.   Your task is to help the coach find a best order of pizzas for given values of SD, SH, SV, SE, PS, PM, PL. The order shall minimize the number of pizza slices, while providing enough slices for all the students as required. If there are multiple such orders, you shall find the cheapest order. It there are still multiple possible orders, you may choose any of them.  Input The input begins with the number of test cases T. Each test case contains one line of 7 space separated integers for SD, SH, SV, SE, PS, PM, PL respectively.  Output For each case, output three space separated integers for the best order: the number of small, medium and large pizzas respectively.  Constraints  T ≤ 100  SD, SH, SV, SE ≥ 0  0 ≤ SD + SH + SV + SE ≤ 100  1 ≤ PS, PM, PL ≤ 1000   Example Input: 2 3 14 8 1 15 22 27 1 14 5 0 16 24 32  Output: 1 1 3 0 0 3  Explanation Example 1: We need 33 slices in total. It is not possible to order pizzas with exactly 33 slices. The smallest number larger than 33 we can do is 34. Example 2: We need 24 slices. It is possible to order exactly 24 slices (3 large pizzas will do). Other orders are also possible at the same price. 
Alice and Bob are playing a game. On the desk there are N stones. Alice and Bob take the stones in turn. Alice goes first. In each Alice's turn, Alice has to take at least Amin stones but no more than Amax stones. In each Bob's turn, Bob has to take at least Bmin stones but no more than Bmax stones. The player loses if he/she cannot take a number of stones satisfying the requirement. Both Alice and Bob play optimally. Who will win in the end?  Input The input begins with the number of test cases T. Each case has five integers in a line: N, Amin, Amax, Bmin, Bmax.  Output For each case, output "Alice" if Alice wins and "Bob" otherwise.  Constraints  T ≤ 100 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ Amin ≤ Amax ≤ N 1 ≤ Bmin ≤ Bmax ≤ N   Example Input: 3 5 1 3 1 3 5 1 2 1 3 10 1 2 2 3  Output: Alice Bob Alice  Explanation Example 1: In the 1st turn Alice can take 1 stone. No matter how many stones Bob takes in the 2nd turn, Alice can always take the rest in the 3rd turn. Example 2: If Alice takes 1 stone in the 1st turn, Bob can take 1 stone in the 2nd turn and Alice will face 3 stones in the 3rd turn and she will lose. If Alice takes 2 stones in the first turn, Bob can take all the remaining 3 stones. 
  Ratnadeep is the president of the robotics club of his college. Recently, his club has organized an inter-college competition, which was a grand success. However, when the competition ended, Ratnadeep realized that he has to clean up all the mess created as a result of the event, and the rest of the members of the club have already left for home. The mess was mainly created because of empty cardboard boxes which once contained the equipments required for the event. The cardboard boxes are of cubical shape and are of various sizes. All he has to do is pack one cardboard box inside another, pack the resulting box into another empty box and so on. Also since there is a shortage of space in the club room, he has to pack the boxes in such a way that he finally ends up with the minimum number of packed cardboard boxes possible. Note that a cardboard box can be packed inside another cardboard box only if its size (ie. Length of an edge) is strictly smaller than the second one and only one box (empty or packed) can be packed inside another box. At the moment, he is feeling very exhausted, but being the president of the club he cannot run away from his responsibilities. So he needs your help. You will be provided with the sizes of the various cardboard boxes (which is nothing but an integer denoting the length of an edge of the cube). You have to calculate the minimum number of boxes into which Ratnadeep can pack all the boxes.  Input The first line consists of T denoting the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The first line of each test case consists of an integer N, denoting the number of cardboard boxes. The next line contains N integers – A1, A2, ... , An – denoting the sizes of the cardboard boxes.  Output For each test case output with a single line, the minimum number of cardboard boxes into which all the boxes can be packed.  Constraints 1<=T<=25 1<=N<=10^5 1<=A[i]<=10^9 Sum of N over all test cases <= 10^6  Example Input: 2 5 5 6 8 9 2 7 1 9 5 2 5 1 6 Output: 1 2  Explanation In example case 1, Ratnadeep can pack the boxes as follows: Box of size 2 is packed inside box of size 5. This box is then packed inside the box of size 6, which is then packed inside box of size 8 and then packed into the largest one(ie. of size 9)

 It's a rainy day and Vignesh and Aravind are stuck inside watching the rain. They decide to invent a game, the rules for which are described below. Given array A containing n integers, they take turns making a single move. Both players are moving optimally (playing to win and making no mistakes). During each move, the current player chooses one element from A, adds it to their own score, and deletes the element from A; because the size of A decreases by 1 after each move, A's size will be 0 after n moves and the game ends (as all elements were deleted from A). We refer to Vignesh's score as Sv and Aravind's score as Sa. Aravind wins the game if |Sa-Sv| is divisible by 7; otherwise Vignesh wins. Given A, determine the winner.   Input The first line contains an integer, T, denoting the number of test cases. Each test case is comprised of two lines; the first line has an integer n, and the second line has n space-separated integers a0,a1,…,an−2,an−1 describing array a.  Note:Sa+Sv=a0+a1+...+an−2+an−1.   Output For each test case, print the winner's name on a single line; if Vignesh wins print Vignesh, otherwise print Aravind.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 2000 1 ≤ N ≤ 200     Example Input: 2 3 7 6 18 1 7  Output: Vignesh Aravind     Explanation (Assuming Vignesh plays first, without loss of generality)  Test Case 1 Array A={7,6,18}. The possible play scenarios are: Sv=13, Sa=18, |Sv−Sa|=5, and 5%7≠0. Sv=24, Sa=7, |Sv−Sa|=17, and 17%7≠0. Sv=25, Sa=6, |Sv-Sa|=19, and 19%7≠0. In this case, it doesn't matter what Vignesh chooses because the difference between their scores isn't divisible by 7. Thus, Vignesh wins.  Test Case 2 Array a={7}. Vignesh must choose that element, the first move ends the game. Sv=7, S=0, |Sa−Sv|=7, and 7%7=0. Thus, Aravind wins.

The problem which arises with the usual printing devices is that they print only in serial format. They start printing or displaying text from the left most character and proceed towards right to display a line. Due to this it is difficult to print different formats of data and the design patterns efficiently on screen. Your task is to print a matrix of order n*n with numbers from 1 to n2 in a spiral format. In this format the entry of numbers start from center of the matrix and the filling is proceeded in the anticlockwise direction. The ending cell for even values of n is the first cell (1, 1) and for the odd values of n is the last cell (n, n) of the matrix.  Input The input consists of a single number n such that 0 < n < 15.  Output The output consist of an n*n matrix filled in spirally anticlockwise direction.

Children of New Bernsburg love to play creative games. Once upon a time they decided to play a game called, "KING OF THE RING". In this game they form a ring, a random child is selected and they start counting clockwise from that child until a fixed number (n, which is given at the starting of the game) is reached. When the count reaches n, the child on the nth spot is eliminated. The game continues again starting with the next child and the process continues until a single child remains. Your aim is to print the position of the child which remains till last and hold the title King of the Ring.  Input The first line of input contains number of children, m and the second line contains the fixed number, n, the factor by which children are eliminated.  Output The output must print the position of the last child staying in the game.  Example  Input:  10 6  Output:  3  
Gas leakages at chemical plants might prove to be fatal and put the lives of the workers at risk. The aim is to detect the leakage of a gas and prevent its explosion. Our friend Ramesh has successfully obtained the tender to set up a chemical plant to supply fertilizers to the nearby villages. A magnanimous person by heart, he has always put the welfare of the workers above all. So, safety measures have to be taken. For that worst case possibility is considered here. The rooms of the plant can be modelled as axb matrix. The gas used in his plant has a queer property. In times of its leakage, it expands according to the following rules: If at time t, gas leaks from room (x ,y), then at time t+1 it can breaks the doors of atmost two more rooms out of (x+1,y), (x-1,y), (x,y+1), (x,y-1) and expands. For example if at t = 0 sec if the gas occupies (2, 3), then at time t = 1 sec, the rooms filled with gas can be any of the given 6 possibilities:  1. Rooms at (2,3), (3,3) and (2,4).  2. Rooms at (2,3), (3,3) and (1,3).  3. Rooms at (2,3), (3,3) and (2,2).  4. Rooms at (2,3), (2,4) and (1,3).  5. Rooms at (2,3), (2,4) and (2,2).  6. Rooms at (2,3), (2,2) and (1,3).  Note: At t= 2 sec, it can expand from all the rooms that are full of gas t= 1.  The gas explodes after gas fills all the rooms and there is no room for it to expand. Find the minimum time gas takes for the whole plant to explode and help Ramesh ensure the safety of his workers.  Input T - The number of test cases. a b - number of row and columns in the room matrix. x y- coordinate of the room where the gas leaked  first.  Output The minimum time in seconds the plant take to explode.  Constraints 1 <= T <= 50  1 <= a, b <= 10000  1 <= x <= n  1 <= y <= m   Example Input: 2 9 9 2 6 1 1 1 1   Output: 12 0  
  A large quantity of goods are being produced by the factory every day. Consider the carrier machine of the factory which is used to transport the finished products from the workshop to the dispatch centre. Finished products are kept on the carrier machine from one end, the machine takes the products to the dispatch centre, and the products are taken out at the dispatch center. The machine can take n products in t minutes and return in t minutes. m products arrive at the terminal by a given schedule. What is the earliest time that all the products can be transported to the center? What is the minimum number of trips that the operator must make to deliver all products by that time?     Input The first line of input contains c, the number of test cases. Each test case begins with n, t, m. m lines follow, each giving the arrival time for a product (in minutes since the beginning of the day). The operator can run the machine whenever he or she wishes, but can take only the products that have arrived up to that time.  Output For each test case, output a single line with two integers: the time, in minutes since the beginning of the day, when the last product is delivered to the other side of the river, and the minimum number of trips made by the machine to carry the products within that time. You may assume that 0 < n, t, m < 1440. The arrival times for each test case are in non-decreasing order.  Example Input: 2 2 10 10 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 2 10 3 10 30 40   Output: 100 5 50 2

  In a war of Wasseypur, Faizal Khan was desperate to kill Sultan. He already knew Sultan was going to attack him. Sultan has to meet an important person in Kabal Bagh. Since Faizal Khan somehow, is aware of Sultan's meeting, he has planted master-bombs in the park. Sultan, somehow, had the premonition of Faizal's plan. He took along with him bomb diffuser. But each Master bomb is surrounded by either wall or bombs on each side (north,east,west,south). As soon as Sultan reaches the garden he notes down the coordinates of the bombs that have been planted. Now he has to count the Master bombs that have been placed on the area. Given position of all the bombs help Sultan to count the number of Master Bombs so that he can diffuse them.     Input First line contains t, the number of test cases. The next line contains n, the number of bombs in the grid. Next n lines contain the coordinates of the bombs (xi,yi).  Output Output the number of Master bombs.  Constraints 1<=t<=10 1<=n<=500 0<= xi,yi<=200  Example Input: 2 5 1 1 0 1 1 0 6 1 1 9 8 1 1 4 2 3 1 1 2 0 2 0 1 1 0 1 3   Output: 1 2  
  The alphabet of Zorpia is quite peculiar. It consists of only two letters, A and B and that too in upper-case only. A visitor to Zorpia is amazed by the diversity of words formed by the combination of A and B. He notices one more peculiar thing about the words. All the words were of even length and the number of A’s in the word is equal to the number of B’s. One of the natives told him that it is the number of transitions in the word that guides the pronunciation of the words. The words having same number of transitions are pronounced almost similarly. Let us define what transition means here. A transition occurs in a word whenever there is a change from A to B. Eg: consider the word ABAB. It has three transitions. First when going from index 1 to 2, second when going from 2 to 3 and third when going from 3 to 4. Given the length of the word and the number of transitions, the visitor needs to find out how many such words are possible from the alphabet of Zorpia and following the rules for word as described above.     Input The input consists of several test cases(5000 atmost). Each test case consists of two integers n and k where n is the length of word and n(2<= n <=10000) is even. K is the number of transitions. The input is terminated by n=k=0.  Output For every test case output on a line an integer which is the number of words possible modulo 1,000,000,007.  Example Input: 6 2 6 3 0 0   Output: 4 8     Explanation For the first case the 4 words are AABBBA, ABBBAA, BAAABB, BBAAAB . 
  Social networking has become an epidemic in the current century. Nowadays these sites are being used to expand our network. For some people, growing their social network has become an addictive hobby like stamp collecting. Your task is to observe the interactions on such a website and keep track of the size of each person’s network. Assume that every friendship is mutual. If Aniket is Pranjal’s friend, then Pranjal is also Aniket’s friend.     Input The first line of input contains one integer specifying the number of test cases to follow. Each test case begins with a line containing an integer F, the number of friendships formed, which is no more than 100,000. Each of the following F lines contains the names of two people who have just become friends, separated by a space. A name is a string of 1 to 20 letters (uppercase or lowercase).  Output Whenever a friendship is formed, print a line containing one integer, the number of people in the social network of the two people who have just become friends.  Constraints   0< T < 10  1< F < 99999  Example Input: 1 3 Ankit Suraj Suraj Birbal Birbal Ramesh  Output: 2 3 4    
Alice and Bob want to go on holiday. Each of them has drawn up a list of cities to be visited in turn. A list may contain a city more than once. As they want to travel together, they have to agree upon a common route. No one wants to change the order of the cities on his list or add other cities. Therefore they have no choice but to remove some cities from the list. Of course the common route is to involve as much sight-seeing in cities as possible. There are exactly 26 cities in the region. Therefore they are encoded on the lists as lower case letters from 'a' to 'z'.   Input The first line of input contains a number T ≤ 10 that indicates the number of test cases to follow. Each test case consists of two lines; the first line is the list of Alice, the second line is the list of Bob. Each list consists of 1 to 80 lower case letters.   Output The output for each test case should contain all different trips exactly once that meet the conditions described above. There is at least one such trip, but never more than 1000 different ones. You should order the trips in lexicographic order. Print one blank line between the output of different test cases.   Example  Input: 1 abcabcaa acbacba  Output: ababa abaca abcba acaba acaca acbaa acbca  
Flavius Josephus and 40 fellow rebels were trapped by the Romans. His companions preferred suicide to surrender, so they decided to form a circle and to kill every third person and to proceed around the circle until no one was left. Josephus was not excited by the idea of killing himself, so he calculated the position to be the last man standing (and then he did not commit suicide since nobody could watch).  We will consider a variant of this "game" where every second person leaves. And of course there will be more than 41 persons, for we now have computers. You have to calculate the safe position. Be careful because we might apply your program to calculate the winner of this contest!   Input The input contains several test cases. Each specifies a number n, denoting the number of persons participating in the game. To make things more difficult, it always has the format "xyez" with the following semantics: when n is written down in decimal notation, its first digit is x, its second digit is y, and then follow z zeros. Whereas 0 ≤ x,y ≤ 9, the number of zeros is 0 ≤ z ≤ 6. You may assume that n>0. The last test case is followed by the string 00e0.   Output For each test case generate a line containing the position of the person who survives. Assume that the participants have serial numbers from 1 to n  and that the counting starts with person 1, i.e., the first person leaving is the one with number 2. For example, if there are 5 persons in the circle, counting proceeds as 2, 4, 1, 5 and person 3 is staying alive.   Example  Input: 05e0 01e1 42e0 66e6 00e0   Output: 3 5 21 64891137   
 Leonardo da Vinci is preparing the background for his new painting. Since this is the computer age, he is using an electronic paper which is initially white. Paper is a MxN rectangular gird having MxN square cells. With paint(i,j) operation, his computer fills the cell(i,j) of the paper with black color. However, at any point in time, he may want to know the size of biggest black segment. Black Segment is defined as the group of cells in which any two vertical or horizontal neighboring cells are black. He asks for your help to complete the above task.   Input  The first line contains two integers, M and N. Next line contains an integer Q,  where Q is total number of queries. The following Q lines each have a query Qi containing an integer B. B is either 0 or 1. If B is 1, two integers i and j follow which corresponds to the operation paint(i,j) (1-based index).   Output  For every query with B=0, output the size of biggest black segment.   Example  Input: 3 3 9 1 2 1 0 1 1 3 0 1 3 3 1 2 3 0 1 2 2 0  Output: 1 1 3 5        Figure from Example.

Alice and Bob are playing a game. Alice gives Bob a string S. Then, she asks him Q queries. The positions in the string are labelled as 1, 2, 3, ..., |S| (|S| denotes the length of S). Each query is of the form [l, r]. Bob has to form a palindromic string using some of the characters at positions that lie in the range [l, r]. More formally, he can pick characters at position i such that  l ≤ i ≤ r . He can rearrange them the way he wants. Now, for each query Alice wants to know what is the maximum length of the string Bob can form. Note: A string is said to be palindromic if it reads same forward or backward. For example, aa, bab are palindromic while ab, abc are not.  Input First line of the input contains the string S. Next line contains a single integer Q which denotes the number of queries. Each of the next Q lines have two space separated integers l and r.  Output For each test case, output a single integer which is the maximum length of a palindromic string that Bob can form in that case.  Constraints  1 ≤ |S| ≤ 2 × 10^5 1 ≤ Q ≤ 2 × 10^5 S contains only lower case English alphabets ('a'-'z')   Example Input: aabb 3 1 3 1 4 3 3  Output: 3 4 1    Explanation Example case 1. Bob can form aba Example case 2. Bob can form abba or baab Example case 3. Bob can form b 
  Arora is a content person because, his name can be spelt the same, when seen from both left and right sides, ie. a palindrome. Seeing this, his friend, gagan, also wanted to have something unique about his name. So, he finds out, that by changing a single letter of his name(gaga'g'), his name also becomes a palindrome. Arora has many other friends and want to find out the same. They seek your help, to find out if the same can happen with their names. Remember, just a single digit can be changed.

Output Print 'yes' (without quotes) if it is possible, else 'no'.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ S ≤ 1000   Example Input: 2 arora abcd  Output: yes no 
Palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward, e.g., madam. You are given a string whose length is even, and each character of the string is either 'a', 'b' or '/' Your task is to replace each occurrence of '/' in string with either 'a' or 'b' such that the string becomes a palindrome. You are also given two integers, aCost and bCost. Replacing '/' with 'a' costs aCost, and replacing '/' with 'b' costs bCost. Return the minimum cost of replacing '/' by 'a' and 'b' such that the string turns into a palindrome. If it is impossible to obtain a palindrome, return -1. Constraints  string will contain between 1 and 10000 characters, inclusive.  The length of string will be even.  Each character of the string will be either 'a' or 'b' or '/'.  aCost will be between 1 and 100, inclusive.  bCost will be between 1 and 100, inclusive. Input Format First line of input will contain the number of test cases. For each test case, there will be of three lines, the first line is the string whose palindrome is to be constructed, the second is the aCost and the third is the bCost Examples 1 aba/bab/ 4 6 Returns: 10 The only way to produce a palindrome is to replace 4th character of string with 'b' and 8th character with 'a'. The first replacement costs 4, the second costs 6, so the total cost is 4+6=10. aaaabbbb 12 34 Returns: -1 There is no '/' character, and string is not a palindrome. We have no way to change it into a palindrome.  Sample Input: 1 baba//aaa/ab// 72 23 Sample Output: 213

Problem Description Pappu G of the famous C Party recently faced an interview. But as expected of him, he had studied only few words like RTI, women empowerment, youth, open system etc. He used these words so often in the interview that the audience mocked at him after the interview. Pappu G got very upset with all these and decided to analyze his interview. Of course he knows nothing and has so asked you to write a program to calculate the frequency of each of his words. Given a sentence S, and Q words, you need to find out the count of each of those words in the interview. Input The first line of the input consists of the number of cases (T). T test cases follows. Each test case begins with line with the sentence (S). The sentence consists of upper case and lower case English alphabets only. Next line indicates the number of queries (Q). Next Q lines have a word each whose count you need to find in the sentence. Output For each test case, output Q lines, one for each query which is the count of the word. Constraints  T ≤ 50 1 ≤|S| ≤10000 Q ≤ 100 1 ≤ |word| ≤10000 Sample Cases  2 RTIWomenRTIYouthRTI 5 Country RTI Women Youth rti PPP 1 PP Output  0 3 1 1 0 2 Explanations  In the first case, we have 3 occurrences of "RTI" and 1 each for "Women" and "Youth". Note that words are case sensitive. After all Pappu G is a sensitive person. So "rti" has 0 frequency. In the second case, "PP" has 2 occurrence. Note that words may overlap.  
For sure, the love mobiles will roll again on this summer's street parade. Each year, the organisers decide on a fixed order for the decorated trucks. Experience taught them to keep free a side street to be able to bring the trucks into order.  The side street is so narrow that no two cars can pass each other. Thus, the love mobile that enters the side street last must necessarily leave the side street first. Because the trucks and the ravers move up closely, a truck cannot drive back and re-enter the side street or the approach street.  You are given the order in which the love mobiles arrive. Write a program that decides if the love mobiles can be brought into the order that the organisers want them to be.     Input The first line of the input contains a number T the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single number n, the number of love mobiles. The second line contains the numbers 1 to n in an arbitrary order. All the numbers are separated by single spaces. These numbers indicate the order in which the trucks arrive in the approach street. No more than 1000 love mobiles participate in the street parade.     Output For each test case your program has to output a line containing a single word yes if the love mobiles can be re-ordered with the help of the side street, and a single word no in the opposite case.     Example  Input: 1 5 5 1 2 4 3     Output: yes    
 There is a new mall in the city and customers have one floor of parking available in its basement. The parking lot consists of m rows of n parking slots each. When owners come back  where (s)he has parked his/her car they may have to examine mXn cars in the worst case to find the car. In order to attract customers, the mall has decided to ease this trouble by hiring a new parking lot attendant to park the cars. The diligent attendant has thought of the following scheme to park the cars. The license number of each vehicle is a positive number. License numbers are unique to a car - no two cars have the same number. The attendant has decided that for ease of locating a car, he will keep each row and each column sorted in ascending order of license numbers. Imagine the columns as being arranged from west to east and the rows being arranged north to south. Any unused slot in a row or column will be present only at the end - that is, once an empty slot is encountered on a row, there will be no car to the east of the slot on the same row, and once an empty slot is encountered on a column, there will be no car to the south of the slot on that column. Let's call such a lot as an "ordered lot". Once he has thought of this scheme, he has to design various operations to maintain the order once cars are removed. We wish him well with his grand scheme, but we will assist him only in the simplest operation - that of removing the car with the smallest license number. This operation is performed on an already ordered lot. If we remove any car creating an empty slot, we can fill that empty slot by moving the car immediately to its east, or immediately south, to the empty slot. The attendant has to do this until the parking lot becomes an "ordered lot", once again. You have to help him by computing the least number of cars that he has to move, after removing the smallest numbered car, such that the lot becomes ordered.  Input The input consists of several lines. The first line is a number saying how many distinct parking lots are present in the input. This is followed by a set of inputs, each representing an ordered parking lot. Each lot starts with a line containing two numbers m and n, separated by a blank space where the first number m is  the number of rows and the second one, n, is the number of columns in that lot. This is followed by m rows of n columns of numbers, each representing a license number. Empty slots will be represented by the number 2147483647.  Output The output should consist of several line, each containing a number. Each line i corresponds to a parking lot i in the input. The output number for a lot should be the minimum number of cars that the attendant should move once the car with the minimum license number is removed, to maintain an ordered lot.

 Note: For Turbo C++, select "Text" as your language   Problem Description: In IIIT we use password system to unlock the lab doors and only Mtech students are given the password for these labs. Password system comprises of n*n keypad where n is odd. One day Ashish saw an Mtech student using the password. He figured out that the password is symmetric about the centre point ( centre point for n*n keypad will be point with co-ordinates (n/2, n/2) according to 0 based indexing or (n/2+1, n/2+1) according to 1 based indexing). Now he has to try all possible symmetric combinations to unlock the door. Since he has not enough time he asks you to tell if given password is symmetric or not. You will be given n*n binary grid containing elements as 0 if that key is not used and 1 if that key is used. You need to tell whether the given binary grid is symmetric according to the centre point.    Input First line contains an integer t denoting number of test cases. Each test case begin with an integer n denoting the size of the grid. Next n line contains n space separated integers. Each integer is 1 or 0 depending on if that button is pressed for that password or not.    Output For each test case output single line containing “Yes” or “No” depending on whether the given password is symmetric or not.    Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ n ≤ 100     Example Input: 3 3 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 3 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 3 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0  Output: Yes No No    Explanation Example case 1. Since the given password is symmetric along centre point so ans is Yes. Example case 2. Since the given password is not symmetric along centre point so ans is No. 
I have been asked to set problems for this contest, what do I do now ? Lets see the standard stuff in most of the programming contests and make one problem out of it. Hmm... many problems are having Binary digits, Grids, Paths, Coins, Maximize or Minimize something, so let me mix them all now in to one problem, the one problem to rule them all ;) Lets have a grid of size N x M having N rows and M columns, and put gold coins in it. How many in each cell ? , lets involve binary here. I'll give you two binary strings A[1...N] and B[1...M]. Cell (i,j) (1-based indexing) Row-i and Column-j in the grid contains A[i] * B[j] gold coins. From a cell (i,j), you can move to any of the 4 adjacent cells (i-1,j), (i+1,j), (i,j-1), (i,j+1) in one step. I want a path of minimum length from top-left cell (1,1) to bottom-right cell (N,M), and the value of this path = number of gold coins it covers. Find the maximum value of such a path. Not every one wants to become a Raja, also find the minimum value of such a path.   Input First line contains T [ number of test cases, around 10 ]. T cases follow, each having 2 lines, "N A" and "M B" (quotes for clarity only). [ 1 ≤ N,M ≤ 3000, and each character in A, B is either 0 or 1 ]   Output For each test case, print the maximum value of a path followed by the minimum value of a path, in the same line, separated by a single space. Output of each case should be in a separate line.   Example  Input: 2 4 1001 3 110 5 01111 3 110  Output: 3 1 5 0  Explanation: Case 1 : A Maximum path in bold  110 000 000 110  Case 1 : A Minimum path in bold  110 000 000 110  
 While learning simple DP problems, Ira came across this simple problem. Given a grid in two dimensions having N  rows and  M  columns, how many paths exist from top-left cell of the grid to bottom-right cell when allowed movements in one step are one cell from left to right or one cell top to bottom only?  Formally, a cell of the given grid G in the i^th  row and  j ^ th   column is represented as G(i, j) . In one step, Ira can go from G(i, j) to either G(i+1, j) or G(i, j+1). One way to count number of paths from G(1, 1) to G(N, M) is using Dynamic Programming. Let us denote this count as C(G) i.e., number of paths from G(1, 1) to G(N, M) in grid G.   After learning this DP problem, she thought about a similar problem. Given the value of X = C(G), find the corresponding Grid, G. There might be many grids G having same value of C(G). You need to find out all of them satisfying the output constraints given under constraints section.   Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. Only line of each test case contains one integer denoting value of X   Output  For each test case, if there are no grids G having N rows and M columns, satisfying the constraints, such that C(G) = X then print in one line "The Grid is Too Big!". Otherwise, in first line print the number of grids such that C(G) = X and satisfying the output constrains. Following lines, each containing one possible grid, two space separated integers denoting N and M respectively. Output should be sorted according to increasing value of N.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000 1 ≤ M ≤ 1000 1 ≤ X ≤ 10^1000   Example Input: 3 2 6 2011  Output: 1 2 2 3 2 6 3 3 6 2 The Grid is Too Big!  
  There is a man standing in front of a market, 1 represent filled area and 0 represents road. In how many ways can he visit all roads (0s), you have to print that. He cannot move through 1s, but he can move through 0s. There won't be any loops in the paths of 0s. Two paths are different if at any of the point of intersection of two roads he takes a different direction. He can revisit a road (0 or 0s) as many times as needed only when it is needed to make the path complete, that is he can retrace a path if its needed to complete the path. Also, he cannot move diagonally. See example for more clarity.   His original position is on the first row of the matrix with a 0 in it and the first column of that row which is a 0. It will be possible for him to visit all 0s, roads in the market are like that, that is all the paths in the road would be traceable. Hint can be found in these gifs:       Input Test cases will start with an integer T the count of test cases. Each test case will have two space separated integers on a newline x and y, x denoting the number of rows in the array and y denoting the number of columns. Each test case will be followed by x rows of y integers, either 0 or 1.   Output   Output an integer for each input, each on a newline.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ x ≤ 20 1 ≤ y ≤ 20     Example Input: 1 5 13 0000000000000 1111111111110 0000000000000 1111111111101 0000000000000  Output: 4   Explanation Example case 1. he can go like this.. where 2 represents visited (these are incomplete paths, but shows the possibilities)  2222222222222 1111111111112 2222222222222 1111111111101 0000000000000 He has to come back to that point where he can go further down.    or like this  2222222222222 1111111111112 0000000000022 1111111111121 2222222222220  Again he has to come back from the left most 2 in the bottom row to visit the univisited 0s.  Remember he has to complete visiting all 0s. Visiting all 0s gives 4 possible path configurations in the above array. 
You have M identical eggs. You want to determine the maximum height that you can drop an egg from a building of N floors without breaking it (or determine if the egg does breaks even when dropped from the first floor). Let us call this maximum safe height the critical height. Our eggs have a unique property: they can withstand one fall from a height greater than the critical height. If the same egg falls from a height greater than the critical height for a second time, it breaks, and it can't be used again. You can use an egg any number of times as long as it is not broken. What is the minimum number of throws you need to determine the critical height in the worst case assuming you follow an optimal strategy? Input: The first line contains the number of test cases T. Each of the next T lines contains two integers N and M each. Output: Output T lines, containing the required answer for the corresponding case. Constraints: 1 <= T <= 1000 1 <= N,M <= 300 Sample Input: 3 2 1 3 2 5 2 Sample Output: 3 4 5 Explanation: For the first example, N = 2 and M = 1. One strategy is to throw the egg from the first floor twice (note that our special eggs cannot break the very first time you throw it). If the egg breaks, the critical height is 0. Otherwise, throw the egg from second floor twice to determine its critical height. This requires 4 throws in the worst case. However, there is a better strategy. First throw the egg from floor 2, then from floor 1. If the egg breaks on the second throw, the critical height is 0. If it does not, throw it once again from floor 2 and check if it breaks. This requires just 3 throws in the worst case. A character string is said to have period k if it can be formed by concatenating one or more repetitions of another string of length k. For example, the string "abcabcabcabc" has period 3, since it is formed by 4 repetitions of the string "abc". It also has periods 6 (two repetitions of "abcabc") and 12 (one repetition of "abcabcabcabc"). 
There is an infinite integer grid at which N people have their houses on. They decide to unite at a common meeting place, which is someone's house.  From any given cell, all 8 adjacent cells are reachable in 1 unit of time.  eg: (x,y) can be reached from (x-1,y+1) in a single unit of time. Find a common meeting place which minimizes the sum of the travel times of all the persons.  Input Format: N The following N lines will contain two integers saying the x & y coordinate of the i-th person.  Output Format: M M = min sum of all travel times;   Constraints: N <= 10^5 The absolute value of each co-ordinate in the input will be atmost 10^9  HINT: Please use long long 64-bit integers; Input #00: 4 0 1 2 5 3 1 4 0   Output #00: 8   Explanation: Sums of travel times of the houses are 11, 13, 8 and 10. 8 is the minimum. Input #01: 6 12 -14 -3 3 -14 7 -14 -3 2 -12 -1 -6 Output #01: 54

You have an unbiased coin which you want to keep tossing until you get N consecutive heads. You've tossed the coin M times and surprisingly, all tosses resulted in heads. What is the expected number of additional tosses needed until you get N consecutive heads? Input: The first line contains the number of cases T. Each of the next T lines contains two numbers N and M. Output: Output T lines containing the answer for the corresponding test case. Print the answer rounded to exactly 2 decimal places. Sample Input: 4 2 0 2 1 3 3 3 2 Sample Output: 6.00 4.00 0.00 8.00 Sample Explanations: If N = 2 and M = 0, you need to keep tossing the coin until you get 2 consecutive heads. It is not hard to show that on average, 6 coin tosses are needed. If N = 2 and M = 1, you need 2 consecutive heads and have already have 1. You need to toss once more no matter what. In that first toss, if you get heads, you are done. Otherwise, you need to start over, as the consecutive counter resets, and you need to keep tossing the coin until you get N=2 consecutive heads. The expected number of coin tosses is thus 1 + (0.5 * 0 + 0.5 * 6) = 4.0  If N = 3 and M = 3, you already have got 3 heads, so you do not need any more tosses.   Constraints: 1 <= T <= 100 1 <= N <= 1000 0 <= M <= N 
Five of the faculty members of IIIT-Delhi Prof. A, Prof. B, Prof. C, Prof. D and Prof. E have their rooms on different floors of the Academic Building, which has five floors. A week student X has been called by these five professors to discuss his declining performance. But he, having weak memory, has forgotten on which floors are rooms of ALL the respective faculty members located. However, he remembers some information using which it can be figured out on which floors are their rooms located. Can you help him out with it? You are provided with specifications pertaining to each professor and you are supposed to find out the exact floor on which their room is.  Input The first lines contains a number “T” specifying the number of test cases. (1 ≤ T ≤ 20) Each test case will be of five lines, each line will provide certain specifications about where the person lives. The first line will contain data for Prof. A, second for Prof. B and so on. The following abbreviations are used for the input : A/B/C/D/E : Professor's room is on an ADJACENT floor to that of A/B/C/D/E NA/NB/NC/ND/NE : Professor's room is not on an adjacent floor to that of A/B/C/D/E. +A/+B/+C/+D/+E : Professor's room is on a  floor higher than of A/B/C/D/E. -A/-B/-C/-D/-E : Professor's room is on a floor lower than of A/B/C/D/E. 1/2/3/4/5 : Professor's room is on that specific floor. N1/N2/N3/N4/N5 : Professor's room is NOT on that specific floor. Each line would contain a combination of the above mentioned abbreviations, each separated by a space. Note: “Adjacent” means that they have rooms on consecutive floors, for example : 2,3 or 4,3 etc. “Higher” or “Lower” does not ONLY mean on a floor which is one more or one less than the one specified. “Higher” simply means that professor has a room on ANY floor which is higher than the one specified.  Output For each test case, the output must be the names of the Professors in the order of floors on which they are residing, starting from 1st floor. The alphabets must be printed in one line, without any space in between.  Example Input: 2 NC N5 N1 N1 N5 +C NA NC 1 +B -A NA E N2 N4 D  Output: CBADE BCEDA  
IIIT-Delhi’s canteen has five workstations, one for Chinese, one for Mexican, one for Italian, one for South Indian and one for Punjabi food. Each workstation can work only on two dishes at a particular time and each station takes exactly 5 units of time to prepare one dish.   You have a list of people who come in at different times and order food at the canteen  according to the cuisine. At a particular time, only two items of a person’s order will be sent to the kitchen to be made at the workstations and then the person will be sent to the end of the line (waiting queue), while the order of the next customer will be taken. The customer who has been sent at the end of the line will then wait for his turn at the counter again. The two items which will be sent to the kitchen will be according to the order in which they have been taken as an input. No customer can leave the restaurant in between. There is ONLY ONE counter which entertains only ONE person at a time (i.e. at a time, only one person would be placing order).  You are required to calculate the total waiting time for which the customers will wait AT THE COUNTER on a particular day. Only at the counter and not at the queue.  Input First line of input contains the number of test cases T. The first line of each test case contains the number of customers N. Next N lines contain information about the orders placed. Each line has six space separated integers, specifying the arrival time (UNIQUE), number of items for Chinese, Mexican, Italian, South Indian and Punjabi respectively. The input will be provided in the order of the arrival time. NOTE : Number of items for each cuisine will always be an even number.   Output The output for each test case would be a single number which gives the total waiting time of the customers at the ordering counter ONLY.   Example Input: 1 2 1 2 4 0 0 0 2 2 4 0 0 0  Output: 16 
You are provided with coordinates of four points as input and your task is to determine whether they form a Quadrilateral, Parallelogram, Square, Rhombus, Rectangle or None of These. It is safe to assume that the four points entered are in the order of A, B, C, D and you have to determine which quadrilateral (or none) is formed by ABCD.   Input The first line of the input is the number of test cases T.

Problem Description: Javascript is a great language its the programming language of the web. This question requires you to learn a new programming language i.e Javascript. The solutions should be submitted in Javascript only. Codechef inputs javascript in node.js format. You don't have to google much about node.js. Just read about Javascript in general and try running your code here. Internet is nothing but a global connection of devices or interconnected computer networks. Information we send on the web passes through a series of network, this information can be read by the nodes on the network. If we send in plaintext information, a hacker sitting on the network can read our information and use it. That’s why we do things differently! We use something called Cryptography. Its the practice of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties. Dr. Jojo is a smart guy, he’s using a  MD5 encoding to make his files secure. Our intelligence department have told us to research on Brute Force attack. Try to not implement everything, we expect you to get the encoding/decoding code from online. Search smart you have 40 mins of internet access only.  Problem Statement: Dr. Jojo is targeting world domination, he’s training a bunch of hackers at ei ei ei tee dee. Schools all over India has hired you to decode the message, which they claim contains a very important message. The hackers are towards the end of their summer vacations and he just passed down this compressed file to them in a group email. Thanks to an inner mole we were able to extract that email.  This is the contents of the email:  The message is 0c049ca2ad590d34d1753419f64eff19  The last hacker we hired almost decoded the message, but we were too late to get it from him.

  Joel and Neha have been working to balance the CS Club's finances.  They have a stack of tickets, each containing the date and amount of money spent, and they need to process them.  However, they each prefer to process them in a different order.  Joel wishes to process them in order of the greatest expense to the smallest expense, while Neha wishes to process them starting with the oldest expense and ending with the most recent.  Create a program that will take in a list of dates and expenses and then print out both ways of ordering the tickets..    Input A list of tickets values and dates.  Each ticket will have a number and a date in MM/DD/YY format.  The list will terminate with -1.  Output Money: followed by each ticket in order stating with the greatest expense. After that, Date: followed by each ticket starting in order starting with the oldest.  Example Input: 10 01/01/01 5 01/03/01 15 03/02/02 -1  Output: Money: [15, 03/02/02] [10, 01/01/01] [5, 01/03/01] Date: [10, 01/01/01] [5, 01/03/01] [15, 03/02/02] 
  Yesterday, the CS Club hosted a massive party that put all the frat parties to shame.  Today, they have to clean up everything.  They also have to restock the strategic supply of Mountain Dew.  Phillip hates cleaning and wants to pick up the dew instead.  He knows that they intend to distribute the chores by having everyone get a number between 1 and the number of people who actually stayed to help clean up.  Once everyone has a number, they will start with the person who has number "1" and skip some number of people.  The person who they land on will be given a specific cleaning task.  The last person picked will not have to clean and will instead get the Dew.  Help Phillip avoid work by creating a program that will take in the number of people participating and the number skipped and output which number Phillip should get in order to the last to get a chore.    Input The number of people playing and the number being skipped.  Output The number that will be picked last. Tips:  Here  is a website that visualizes this problem   Example Input: 41 3  Output: 31    Explanation Example case 1. ... 
  Doubleville, a small town in Texas, was attacked by the aliens. They have abducted some of the residents and taken them to the a spaceship orbiting around earth. After some (quite unpleasant) human experiments, the aliens cloned the victims, and released multiple copies of them back in Doubleville. So now it might happen that there are 6 identical person named Hugh F. Bumblebee: the original person and its 5 copies. The Federal Bureau of Unauthorized Cloning (FBUC) charged you with the task of determining how many copies were made from each person. To help you in your task, FBUC have collected a DNA sample from each person. All copies of the same person have the same DNA sequence, and different people have different sequences (we know that there are no identical twins in the town, this is not an issue).    Input  The input contains several blocks of test cases. Each case begins with a line containing two integers: the number 1 ≤ n ≤ 20000 people, and the length 1 ≤ m ≤ 20 of the DNA sequences. The next n lines contain the DNA sequences: each line contains a sequence of m characters, where each character is either 'A', 'C', 'G' or 'T'.  The input is terminated by a block with n = m = 0 .   Output For each test case, you have to output n lines, each line containing a single integer. The first line contains the number of different people that were not copied. The second line contains the number of people that were copied only once (i.e., there are two identical copies for each such person.) The third line contains the number of people that are present in three identical copies, and so on: the i -th line contains the number of persons that are present in i identical copies. For example, if there are 11 samples, one of them is from John Smith, and all the others are from copies of Joe Foobar, then you have to print '1' in the first and the tenth lines, and '0' in all the other lines.   Example  Input:  9 6 AAAAAA ACACAC GTTTTG ACACAC GTTTTG ACACAC ACACAC TCCCCC TCCCCC 0 0  Output:  1 2 0 1 0 0 0 0 0   
You are given a simple map of an archipelago. Can you determine how many islands it shows?  The map consists of grid squares with characters, where '#' indicates land and '.' indicates water. Two land squares belong to the same island if they are neighbouring grid squares, which means their x coordinates and y coordinates differ by at most 1.   Input The first line of the input contains a number T ≤ 20 which indicates the number of test cases to follow.  Each test case starts with a line containing two numbers n and m (1 ≤ n,m ≤ 200), the number of rows and the number of columns of the grid, respectively. The following n lines contain m characters each and describe the map to be processed. You may assume that the map contains only characters '#' and '.', and that the border of the map consists only of water (character '.').   Output For each test case print in a line the number of islands shown on the corresponding map in the input.   Example  Input:  2 1 1 . 6 4 .... ..#. .#.. .... .##. ....  Output:  0 2   
  Given a natural number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500000), please output the summation of all its proper divisors.  Definition: A proper divisor of a natural number is the divisor that is strictly less than the number.  e.g. number 20 has 5 proper divisors: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, and the divisor summation is: 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 = 22.    Input  An integer stating the number of test cases (equal to about 200000), and that many lines follow, each containing one integer between 1 and 500000 inclusive.   Output  One integer each line: the divisor summation of the integer given respectively.   Example  Input:  3 2 10 20  Output:  1 8 22   
A printer – who still uses moveable type – is preparing to print a set of pages for a book. These pages are to be numbered, as usual. The printer needs to know how many instances of each decimal digit will be required to set up the page numbers in the section of the book to be printed.  For example, if pages 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 are to be printed, computing the number of digits is relatively simple: just look at the page numbers that will appear, and count the number of times each digit appears. The digit 0 appears only once, the digit 1 appears 7 times, the digits 2, 3, 4 and 5 each appear once, and 6, 7, 8 and 9 don’t appear at all.  Your task in this problem is to provide the printer with the appropriate counts of the digits. You will be given the numbers of the two pages that identify the section of the book to be printed. You may safely assume that all pages in that section are to be numbered, that no leading zeroes will be printed, that page numbers are positive, and that no page will have more than three digits in its page number.   Input  There will be multiple cases to consider. The input for each case has two integers, A and B, each of which is guaranteed to be positive. These identify the pages to be printed. That is, each integer P between A and B, including A and B, is to be printed. A single zero will follow the input for the last case.   Output  For each input case, display the case number (1, 2, …) and the number of occurrences of each decimal digit 0 through 9 in the specified range of page numbers. Display your results in the format shown in the examples below.   Example  Input:  10 15 912 912 900 999 0  Output:  Case 1: 0:1 1:7 2:1 3:1 4:1 5:1 6:0 7:0 8:0 9:0 Case 2: 0:0 1:1 2:1 3:0 4:0 5:0 6:0 7:0 8:0 9:1 Case 3: 0:20 1:20 2:20 3:20 4:20 5:20 6:20 7:20 8:20 9:120  
  Before ACM can do anything, a budget must be prepared and the necessary financial support obtained. The main income for this action comes from Irreversibly Bound Money (IBM). The idea behind is simple. Whenever some ACM member has any small money, he takes all the coins and throws them into a piggy-bank. You know that this process is irreversible, the coins cannot be removed without breaking the pig. After a sufficiently long time, there should be enough cash in the piggy-bank to pay everything that needs to be paid.  But there is a big problem with piggy-banks. It is not possible to determine how much money is inside. So we might break the pig into pieces only to find out that there is not enough money. Clearly, we want to avoid this unpleasant situation. The only possibility is to weigh the piggy-bank and try to guess how many coins are inside. Assume that we are able to determine the weight of the pig exactly and that we know the weights of all coins of a given currency. Then there is some minimum amount of money in the piggy-bank that we can guarantee. Your task is to find out this worst case and determine the minimum amount of cash inside the piggy-bank. We need your help. No more prematurely broken pigs!  Input  The input consists of T test cases. The number of them (T) is given on the first line of the input file. Each test case begins with a line containing two integers E and F. They indicate the weight of an empty pig and of the pig filled with coins. Both weights are given in grams. No pig will weigh more than 10 kg, that means 1 ≤ E ≤ F ≤ 10000. On the second line of each test case, there is an integer number N (1 ≤ N ≤ 500) that gives the number of various coins used in the given currency. Following this are exactly N lines, each specifying one coin type. These lines contain two integers each, Pand W (1 ≤ P ≤ 50000, 1 ≤ W ≤10000). P is the value of the coin in monetary units, W is it's weight in grams.   Output  Print exactly one line of output for each test case. The line must contain the sentence "The minimum amount of money in the piggy-bank is X." where X is the minimum amount of money that can be achieved using coins with the given total weight. If the weight cannot be reached exactly, print a line "This is impossible.".   Example  Input:  3 10 110 2 1 1 30 50 10 110 2 1 1 50 30 1 6 2 10 3 20 4  Output:  The minimum amount of money in the piggy-bank is 60. The minimum amount of money in the piggy-bank is 100. This is impossible.   
  Your task consists of evaluate a polynomial of degree n (0 <= n <= 999) represented by its n+1 coefficients of the form: pn(x) = cnxn + cn-1xn-1 + … + c2x2 + c1x + c0  in each one of the k (1 <= k <= 100) points x1, x2, …, xk. The coefficients of the polynomial and the values where they will be evaluated are integers in the interval [-100, 100] that guarantees that the polynomial's evaluation is at the most 263 – 1.  Input  There will be multiple test cases, each one with 4 lines that are described below  n: degree of polynomial.  cn cn-1 … c2 c1 c0: coefficients of the polynomial separated by a single space.  k: number of points to evaluate the polynomial.  x1 x2 … xk-1 xk: points to evaluate the polynomial separated by a single space.  The final test case is a single line where n = -1 and this case should not be processed.  Output  For each test case you should print k + 1 lines of output, the very first line containing the case number and the following k lines with the result of the polynomial's evaluation in each one of the k given points. See the sample.   Example  Input:  2 1 -2 -1 5 0 1 -1 2 -2 3 2 1 -2 -1 4 0 -1 2 -2 -1  Output:  Case 1: -1 -2 2 -1 7 Case 2: -1 0 15 -9  
  You are given an unweighted, undirected graph. Write a program to check if it's a tree topology.   Input  The first line of the input file contains two integers N and M --- number of nodes and number of edges in the graph (0 < N ≤ 10000, 0 ≤ M ≤ 20000). Next M lines contain M edges of that graph --- Each line contains a pair (u, v) means there is an edge between node u and node v (1 ≤ u,v ≤ N).   Output  Print YES if the given graph is a tree, otherwise print NO.   Example  Input: 3 2 1 2 2 3   Output: YES   
Recall the definition of the Fibonacci numbers:       f1 := 1     f2 := 2     fn := fn-1 + fn-2 (n ≥ 3)  Given two numbers a and b, calculate how many Fibonacci numbers are in the range [a,b].    Input  The input contains several test cases. Each test case consists of two non-negative integer numbers a and b. Input is terminated by a=b=0. Otherwise, a ≤ b ≤ 10^100. The numbers a and b are given with no superfluous leading zeros.   Output  For each test case output on a single line the number of Fibonacci numbers fi with a ≤ fi ≤ b.  Example  Input:  10 100 1234567890 9876543210 0 0   Output:  5 4   
  Mo and Larry have devised a way of encrypting messages. They first decide secretly on the number of columns and write the message (letters only) down the columns, padding with extra random letters so as to make a rectangular array of letters. For example, if the message is “There’s no place like home on a snowy night” and there are five columns, Mo would write down  t o i o y h p k n n e l e a i r a h s g e c o n h s e m o t n l e w x  Note that Mo includes only letters and writes them all in lower case. In this example, Mo used the character ‘x’ to pad the message out to make a rectangle, although he could have used any letter. Mo then sends the message to Larry by writing the letters in each row, alternating left-to-right and right-to-left. So, the above would be encrypted as  toioynnkpheleaigshareconhtomesnlewx  Your job is to recover for Larry the original message (along with any extra padding letters) from the encrypted one.   Input  There will be multiple input sets. Input for each set will consist of two lines. The first line will contain an integer in the range 2...20 indicating the number of columns used. The next line is a string of up to 200 lower case letters. The last input set is followed by a line containing a single 0, indicating end of input.   Output  Each input set should generate one line of output, giving the original plaintext message, with no spaces.   Example  Input:  5 toioynnkpheleaigshareconhtomesnlewx 3 ttyohhieneesiaabss 0  Output:  theresnoplacelikehomeonasnowynightx thisistheeasyoneab  
  Vicky (Mr. Perfect) goes for shopping in a shopping mall with N shops to buy an item X. The shops in the shopping malls are in a single row and numbered from 0 to N-1. Each shop has total stock of Ai of the item X. He already knows the available stocks of X in each shop. He can buy any number of X from a shop. Due to his habit for perfection in every task, he will shop according to the following conditions: 1. Vicky only buys either all the stock available in the shop or none of it. 2. Vicky will select the shops in a manner such that all the shops are consecutive. 3. Vicky will only shop if total number of X to be bought is multiple of N. 4. Number of shops to be visited by him should be minimum.  One such solution is always possible. Print the starting shop(l) and ending shop(r). If multiple solutions are possible, then consider the solution with leftmost starting shop.    Input First line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. For each testcase : First line contains a single integer N denoting number of shops in the mall. Second line contains N space separated integers denoting array A, where Ai = number of item X available in i^th shop.    Output For each testcase, print two space separated integers l and r on each line.    Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ Ai ≤ 10^9     Example Input: 3 4 1 2 3 3 6 1 1 2 2 4 2 5 2 2 2 2 2  Output: 1 3 3 4 0 4     Explanation For the 2nd testcase, we can get solution for l=3 (A[3]=2) and r=4 (A[4]=4) following all the condition. 
 Problem statement  	An Adventure Club in UVCE usually goes for trekking. Some members thought that, simply climbing the hill is not very interesting. They came up with a new idea to find the perfectness of the hill. you are given the slant height of the hill, and your task is to help the UVCE Adventure Club to decide whether the hill is perfect or not.   	Adventure Club thinks that all the hills are typically in the shape of isosceles triangles and for given slant height, if the height of the hill can be integer and base-width can be an even integer then the hill is said to be PERFECT, otherwise it is IMPERFECT.   INPUT  First line of the input contains the T, number of test cases. Each test case contains a single line containing an integer S, the slant height of the hill.  OUTPUT  For each test case output PERFECT,if the hill is perfect otherwise output IMPERFECT.    CONSTRAINTS  1 ≤ T ≤ 10000 1 ≤ S ≤ 1000000   EXAMPLE Input  2 5 7  Output  PERFECT IMPERFECT   EXPLANATIONS  An isosceles triangle whose equal sides are 5 units can have 4 unit height and base width can be 6 units. For a isosceles triangle whose equal sides are 7 units, there is no possibility of having integral height and base width of even integer. 
  There are N numbers which has to be arranged. You are given M constraints of the form (a, b) which means that a has to appear before b in the arrangement. Compute the number of arrangements possible modulo 1000000007.    Input Input description. The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains 2 integers N denoting the number of numbers to arrange and M denoting the number of constraints. Each of the next M lines has a pair of space separated integers a and b denoting a constraint.    Output Output description. For each test case, output the number of arrangements modulo 1000000007.    Constraints 1 ≤ T ≤ 5 1 ≤  N ≤ 20 1 ≤  M ≤ 1000 1 ≤  a,b ≤ N    Example Input: 1 3 1 1 3  Output: 3    Explanation Example case 1. There are 3 possible permutations in which 1 comes before 3: 1 2 3, 1 3 2, 2 1 3. 
Peter is an insanely crazy maths professor. One day while giving his lectures, he suddenly hit an absurd idea of having a new seating plan for his class. A class consists of N students. Each student can be represented by a unique identification number ID and his overall marks M. Assume all students have distinct id's in range 1 to  N.  The crazy professor defines a function P(X) as the sum of exponents of all primes in prime-factorization of X. Example P(12) = P(2^1*2^1*3^1) = 3.   Peter decided that all the students with same P(ID) have to sit together in the new seating plan as this will enhance their sincerity in the class.   For this new seating convention, he needs to rearrange the students of the class.The concentration of a permutation arrangement of N students is defined as summation of Marks[student_at_seat_no_i] * i^2 for i in 1 to N. Ivan, being his favorite student, has to devise a seating plan that maximizes the concentration by optimally arranging students in a particular permutation following the above constraint.   Note:  The seats in Peter's class are numbered from 1 to N. Since, the input data is heavy, it is recommended to use faster I/O for example scanf / printf in C++.      Input  The first line of the input contains the number of students N present in the class  Next N lines contains two space separated integers denoting student identification number ID and overall marks Mi of i^th student respectively.  Output  A single integer denoting the maximum possible concentration   Constraints  1  ≤  N ≤ 10^5  1 ≤  A[i] ≤ 10^3   Example Input: 5 1 4 2 5 3 12 4 6 5 15 Output: 640    Explanation : For the given sample case above, students can be arranged in the following way based on their id - 1,4,2,3,5 to maximize the concentration. The concentration is calculated as follows - 4*1^2 + 6*2^2 + 5*3^2 +  12*4^2 + 15*5^2 = 640. 
  Pew and Pew are twins, who aspire to be great mathematicians. They decided to develop a program in their summer vacations (which,in their opinion, might get them a Fields Medal). Given the LCM of two numbers X & Y, they have to figure out how many ordered pairs (X,Y) exist. Since the task seems too tiring school students, they take help from some students at IIITD and can now easily factorize a number into its prime factors. The LCM has been given in prime factorization form. Only the powers of the primes have been given. The sequence is in correspondence with the first 10^5 primes {2,3,5,7,11 ...}. So, if the exponents are {2 3 4}, the number is 2^23^35^4. .  Input First line contains ‘T’, the number of test cases. Next line contains ‘N’, the number of prime factors LCM(X,Y) has. Next line contains ‘N’ integers. The ith number represents the power of the ith prime in LCM(X,Y).  Output For each test case, print the number of possible ordered pairs(x,y) MOD 2   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 100     Example Input: 1 3 2 4 2  Output: 1  Explanation Number of possible pairs is 225. So, 225%2 is 1 
 Problem Description The C Plus International (CPI) and C Plus International [Mathematicians] (CPI M) have always been against each other. CPI this time around wants to show the people that even they have high maths skills like CPI M. The people of the country try to test this new skill of the party with a simple problem. The problem is as follows : Given two numbers N and P the problem asks to find the last digit of N^P. Even this problem is too tough for CPI to handle. So they hire you to write a program to solve this problem.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows  each test case contains two space separated Integers N and P  Output  For each test case, output a single line containing a single Integer , the  last Digit of N^P  Constraints  1 <= T <= 10^5 0 <= N,P <=  10^18     Example Input: 4 2 3 2 4 3 3 3 4  Output: 8 6 7 1  Explanations In the first test case, 2^3 is 8, so the last digit is 8. In the second case 2^4 is 16. But we want only the last digit, so answer is 6. 
 Pinocchio is a very interesting fictional character. Each time he lies, his nose is extended by 1 cm . Pinocchio and Lampwick are best friends.   But Pinocchio's habit of lying has increased manyfold nowadays which has left Lampwick really upset. As a result, he has decided to maintain a diary recording the length of Pinocchio's nose each day. For this, he asks Pinocchio some questions each day and notes down the length of his nose in centimeters at the end of the day. For example, the diary containing entries for a week may look like: 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5 After N days of carefully analysing Pinocchio's lying habit, Lampwick wants to confront Pinocchio. But for that he needs to find out the number of days when Pinocchio lied atleast once. Can you help him out? Being a trusting friend, Lampwick assumes Pinocchio was telling the truth on the first day.    Input First line of input contains T, the number of test cases. For each of the next T lines, two lines follow. The first line contains an integer N, denoting the number of days. The second line contains N space-separated integers L1, L2, ..., LN representing the length of Pinocchio's nose on different days.  Output For each test case, output the number of days when Pinocchio lied atleast once , in a new line  Constraints  1 <= T <= 100 1 <= N <= 10^5 1 <= Li <= 5*10^6    Example Input: 1 7 1 2 2 3 4 5 5 Output: 4  Explanation For the example given above, Pinocchio lied on days 2, 4, 5 and 6 .Hence, the number of days on which he lied = 4. 
 After confronting Pinocchio, Lampwick decided to further analyse his diary about Pinocchio. (You can find the details about the diary in Part 1 of this problem)  Now he needs to find out the maximum number of days that passed by in which Pinocchio surely didn't lie. Can you help him out?    Input First line of input contains T, the number of test cases. For each of the next T lines, two lines follow. The first line contains an integer N, denoting the number of days. The second line contains N space-separated integers L1, L2, ..., LN representing the length of Pinocchio's nose on different days.  Output For each test case, output contains an integer representing the maximum number of days that went by between which Pinocchio surely didn't lie.  Constraints  1 <= T <= 100 1 <= N <= 10^5 1 <= Li <= 5*10^6    Example Input: 1 7 1 2 2 3 4 5 5 Output: 1  Explanation For the example given above, Pinocchio did not lie on day 3rd and 7th, making the maximum number of days that passed by when Pinocchio did not lie in between as 1. 
   Company 'A' produces a special type of rectangular plate used for interior designing. They got an order from Company 'B' to supply them with all possible different rectangular plates of Area equal to 1 to X (Both inclusive). Selling price of one rectangular plate of any Area is Rs. 2. Company 'B' asked Company 'A' manager to tell them the Total Cost. Company 'A' manager is not good at maths so he asked you for help. You have to help Company 'A' manager to find the total cost of all the different plates of Area equal to 1 to X (Both inclusive). (See Example). Note: Length of side of rectangular plate is always an Integer and rectangle with different dimensions are considered different for e.g 1*2 and 2*1 are two different plates   Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. Each test case consists of single integer X.  Output For each test case, output a single line containing the total cost of plates of Area 1 to X ( both inclusive).  Constraints 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ X ≤ 10^6  Sample Input  3 1 2 3  Sample Output  2 6 10  Explanation  In second test case total cost of all the different rectangular plates of Area 1 to 2 (Both inclusive) i.e. cost of plates with area equal to 1 + cost of plates with area equal to 2 No.of plates with area 1 = 1 (1*1) No.of plates with area 2 = 2 (2*1 & 1*2) Total cost = 1*(cost of one plate) + 2*(cost of one plate) = 1*2 + 2*2 = 6  
 In Casino Royal , there was a gambling machine which was quite innovative. It contains a row of numbers, 'MoneyRow. Each time a player plays, the machine generates some random pairs of integers a and b. All such pairs are shown to the player who then has one chance to reorder the numbers of the MoneyRow.  After he is done with the rearranging and presses start button, money equal to the sum of the numbers from ath cell to bth cell ( both inclusive ) of the MoneyRow is added in his account.This process is repeated for each pair (but with the same arrangement of the MoneyRow) generated by the machine and the money in the account keeps on increasing.  Given the row and all pairs, you have to predict the maximum money he can win.   Input The first line contains T, the number of test cases. The next line contains two space separated integers n and q : the count of Numbers in the row and the number of pairs,respectively.  The next line contains n space separated integers Ni, The numbers in the row.  Each of the following q lines contain two space separated integers a and b representing the pair.   Output In a single line print a single integer : Maximum amount of money he can win.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ n 1 ≤ Ni ≤ 10^6 1 ≤ q ≤ 10^6   Example Input: 1 5 3 1 2 3 4 5 3 4 3 4 1 5  Output: 33 
 For Turbo C++ Users : Read the following document before attempting the question :  Problem Description  N-Boy is very eccentric when it comes to strings. These days, he spends most of his time studying palindromes and pangrams (for his IP assignment at IIITD). For those of you who don’t know, a palindrome is a word or a statement which can be read the same way, forward or backward, and a pangram is a word or a statement containing all letters of the English alphabet. Now, he is given a set of strings, and he wants to segregate them into palindromes, pangrams and palingrams, which are palindromic pangrams.

Master Oogway has forseen that a panda named Po will be the dragon warrior, and the master of Chi. But he did not tell anyone about the spell that would make him the master of Chi, and has left Po confused. Now Po has to defeat Kai, who is the super villian, the strongest of them all. Po needs to master Chi, and he finds a spell which unlocks his powerful Chi. But the spell is rather strange. It asks Po to calculate the factorial of a number! Po is very good at mathematics, and thinks that this is very easy. So he leaves the spell, thinking it's a hoax. But little does he know that this can give him the ultimate power of Chi. Help Po by solving the spell and proving that it's not a hoax.    Input First line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.The next T lines contain an integer N.    Output For each test case, print a single line containing the solution to the spell which is equal to factorial of N, i.e. N!. Since the output could be large, output it modulo 1589540031(Grand Master Oogway's current age).    Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100000 1 ≤ N ≤ 100000     Example Input: 4 1 2 3 4   Output: 1 2 6 24 
 In this problem, you will be given a polynomial, you have to print what it becomes after differentiation.   Following are the rules for differentiation:  For a polynomial f(x), its differentiation is defined as f'(x). If a is a constant, then differentiation of af(x) is af'(x). If f(x) = h(x) + g(x) , then f'(x) = h'(x) + g'(x) If f(x) = x ^n, then f'(x) = nx^n-1. This is true for all  n ≠ 0 . If f(x) = c, where c is a constant, f'(x) = 0.   If you are still uncomfortable with differentiation, please read the following:   Link to Wikihow page Link to Wikipedia entry.   Input  First line contains T, the number of test cases to follow. Each test case contains the follows, the first line contains N, the number of non zero terms in the polynomial. Then N lines follow, each line contains a pair of integer which denotes a term in the polynomial, where the first element denotes the coefficient (a) and the second denotes the exponent (p) of the term.   Output Print the polynomial after differentiation in the desired format as described below.   If the coefficient of a term in the output polynomial is 3, and the corresponding exponent is 2, print it as 3x^2 Print " + " (with single space on both side) between each output term.  Print the terms in decreasing value of exponent.  For the constant term (if any), you have to just print the coefficient. You should not print x^0.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10   Example Input: 2 1 1 2 3 1 3 1 1 1 0  Output: 2x^1 3x^2 + 1 
Po, the dragon warrior, has met his Panda dad, and he is so excited! His daddy is exactly like him, no, he his like his daddy. Po is so so happy. He plays with his daddy, they eat, and have a lot of fun. Po takes daddy to the famous Chinese Museum which has a lot of artifacts. From ancient shields, to weapons, secret scrolls, the museum has everything. But again, everything can't be happy as always. Po and his daddy mess with the museum, throw the stuff here and there, and break some things as well. Suddenly he hears some noise, and he senses that Master Shifu is on his way to the Museum. If he doesn't find the museum clean, Po will be in great trouble, and he does not want to get a scolding in front of his daddy. So he thinks of a plan. Po decides to clean the museum before Master Shifu comes, but with a different strategy.The museum has N horizontal strips of carpet arranged adjacent to each other on the floor. Po can swap a strip with any other strip in the museum, any number of times. Each strip is made up of M blocks of carpet. A block of carpet is defined as a 1 × 1 unit square on the carpet strip. For every block of carpet in the museum, Po knows whether it is clean or dirty. We assume the blocks of carpet to form a matrix of size N × M. A submatrix of such matrix is defined by a group of four integers d, u, l, r (1 ≤ d ≤ u ≤ N; 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ M). The area of the submatrix is defined by the number of cells it contains.Since, there is not much time left, Po concludes that the museum may not be cleaned completely, therefore, he decides to swap strips of carpet in such a way that the area of a submatrix having all clean blocks of carpet is maximized. Help Po clean up the mess he and daddy made.    Input First line of the input will contain two integers N and M, the number of carpet strips and the length of each strip respectively. Next N lines contain a string of M characters. Each character is either 'C' or 'D'. 'C' denotes that the block is clean and 'D' denotes that the block is dirty.    Output You need to output a single integer, the maximum area of a submatrix in which all blocks are clean. Output 0 if there are no clean blocks.    Constraints  1 ≤ N,M ≤ 4500     Example Input: 1 1 C  Output: 1  Input: 2 2 CD CC  Output: 2  Input: 4 3 CDD DCC DDD CDC  Output: 2    Note:  Since input files are large, it is advised to use fast input/output methods. 
Polycarp gave you a N * N grid with each cell either comprising of a '#' or a '.'  character.   '#' denotes a blocked cell whereas '.' denotes an empty cell.  Recently, he got admission into a prestigious institute which specializes in Optics. He has a challenge to prepare for a local contest of institute. So, after days of thinking he came up with an idea. You are his good friend and have to help him solve the following problem based on his new idea.   A ray of light starts from the west direction and moves towards east. However, it cannot move through a blocked cell in the rectangular grid. You need to place reflectors(opaque on one side, shiny on the other) in the grid to reflect light towards south such that maximum number of rays emerge out from the south.   You have solved a lot of problems related to physics in your high school but now you remember less about the laws of Optics. Hence, you decide to bring your programming knowledge to rescue. Help your friend Polycarp to solve the problem.     Note :  A ray of light cannot be reflected multiple times by using multiple reflectors.  Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. First line of each test case contains N  denoting the dimension of the grid.. Next N line contains N characters each denoting type of characters in the grid.     Output  Output a single integer for each test case in a separate line, denoting the maximum number of rays that can emerge out from the south.     Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ N ≤ 500 Grid consists of two kinds of characters only i.e '#' and '.'      Example Input: 1 5 ..... #..#. ..... .#... ....# Output: 4   Explanation See the image provided above for the sample test case given. 
 Adele is doing research in the field of computational biology this summer. She has a DNA sequence D, which is made of a smaller sequence S concatenated K times, i.e, D = S + S + S + ... (K times). Now, she needs to generate the sequence D using a smaller sequence, T of length M, of which she will make N copies. Doing this she'll get F = T + T + ... (N times). Each DNA sequence can be represented as a string made up of lowercase latin characters. After she gets F, she can extract out each individual component from the sequence(i.e, characters) and join them together(in some order) to make a new sequence which is equal to D. Now, she wonders, given S, K and M what would be the minimum no. of copies N, of T, she will have to make in order to find T such that she can get D. She wants your help. For given DNA sequence S, the number of it's copies, K and the length of the sequnce T as M, print the minimum number of copies, N, of T which you will have to create and also print the lexicographic smallest such sequence T. Print -1, if not possible.   Input The input contains 2 lines:   The first line contains the string S, the DNA sequence.  The second line contains two space separated numbers integers K and M, denoting the number of copies of S in D and the length of the sequence T.   Output   First line containing an integer N and string T, denoting the minimum number of copies.  Second line containing the string T.  Print -1 in one line if it's not possible to find such N and T.    Subtask #1 (20 points)   1 ≤ |S| ≤ 100  1 ≤ K ≤ 10  1 ≤ M ≤ 1000    Subtask #2 (80 points)   1 ≤ |S| ≤ 10^4  1 ≤ K ≤ 10^14  1 ≤ M ≤ 10^5   Sample Input 1: mama 2 4  Output 1: 2 aamm  Input 2: aab 2 2  Output 2: 4 ab  Input 3: tomato 2 2  Output 3: -1  Explanation Sample 1:  S = mama, K = 2. D = mamamama. For T = aamm and N = 2, we can get F = aammaamm. The characters of F can be used to make a copy of T here. Sample 2:  S = aab, K = 2. D = aabaab. For T = ab and N = 4, we can get F = abababab. The characters of F can be used to make a copy of T here.
