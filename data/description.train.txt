Akhil has many balls of white and black colors. One day, he was playing with them. During the play, he arranged the balls into two rows both consisting of N number of balls. These two rows of balls are given to you in the form of strings X, Y. Both these string consist of 'W' and 'B', where 'W' denotes a white colored ball and 'B' a black colored.  Other than these two rows of balls, Akhil has an infinite supply of extra balls of each color. he wants to create another row of N balls, Z in such a way that the sum of hamming distance between X and Z, and hamming distance between Y and Z is maximized. Hamming Distance between two strings X and Y is defined as the number of positions where the color of balls in row X differs from the row Y ball at that position. e.g. hamming distance between "WBB", "BWB" is 2, as at position 1 and 2, corresponding colors in the two strings differ..  As there can be multiple such arrangements of row Z, Akhil wants you to find the lexicographically smallest arrangement which will maximize the above value.   Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows: First line of each test case will contain a string X denoting the arrangement of balls in first row Second line will contain the string Y denoting the arrangement of balls in second row.   Output  For each test case, output a single line containing the string of length N denoting the arrangement of colors of the balls belonging to row Z.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 3   Example Input: 1 WBWB WBBB  Output: BWBW   Explanation Example case 1. As we know, Hamming Distance(WBWB, BWBW) + Hamming Distance(WBBB, BWBW) = 4 + 3 = 7. You can try any other value for string Z, it will never exceed 6. 
 There's an array A consisting of N non-zero integers A1..N. A subarray of A is called alternating if any two adjacent elements in it have different signs (i.e. one of them should be negative and the other should be positive).  For each x from 1 to N, compute the length of the longest alternating subarray that starts at x - that is, a subarray Ax..y for the maximum possible y ≥ x. The length of such a subarray is y-x+1.   Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T - the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains N. The following line contains N space-separated integers A1..N.   Output For each test case, output one line with N space-separated integers - the lengths of the longest alternating subarray starting at x, for each x from 1 to N.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 -10^9 ≤ Ai ≤ 10^9   Example Input: 3 4 1 2 3 4 4 1 -5 1 -5 6 -5 -1 -1 2 -2 -3  Output: 1 1 1 1 4 3 2 1 1 1 3 2 1 1  Explanation Example case 1. No two elements have different signs, so any alternating subarray may only consist of a single number. Example case 2. Every subarray is alternating. Example case 3. The only alternating subarray of length 3 is A3..5. 
Kattapa, as you all know was one of the greatest warriors of his time. The kingdom of Maahishmati had never lost a battle under him (as army-chief), and the reason for that was their really powerful army, also called as Mahasena. Kattapa was known to be a very superstitious person. He believed that a soldier is "lucky" if the soldier is holding an even number of weapons, and "unlucky" otherwise. He considered the army as "READY FOR BATTLE" if the count of "lucky" soldiers is strictly greater than the count of "unlucky" soldiers, and "NOT READY" otherwise. Given the number of weapons each soldier is holding, your task is to determine whether the army formed by all these soldiers is "READY FOR BATTLE" or "NOT READY". Note: You can find the definition of an even number here.  Input  The first line of input consists of a single integer N denoting the number of soldiers. The second line of input consists of N space separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN, where Ai denotes the number of weapons that the i^th soldier is holding.  Output Generate one line output saying "READY FOR BATTLE", if the army satisfies the conditions that Kattapa requires or "NOT READY" otherwise (quotes for clarity).  Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 100 1 ≤ Ai ≤ 100   Example 1 Input: 1 1  Output: NOT READY  Example 2 Input: 1 2  Output: READY FOR BATTLE  Example 3 Input: 4 11 12 13 14  Output: NOT READY  Example 4 Input: 3 2 3 4  Output: READY FOR BATTLE  Example 5 Input: 5 1 2 3 4 5  Output: NOT READY  Explanation   Example 1: For the first example, N = 1 and the array A = [1]. There is only 1 soldier and he is holding 1 weapon, which is odd. The number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons = 0, and number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons = 1. Hence, the answer is "NOT READY" since the number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons is not greater than the number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons. Example 2: For the second example, N = 1 and the array A = [2]. There is only 1 soldier and he is holding 2 weapons, which is even. The number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons = 1, and number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons = 0. Hence, the answer is "READY FOR BATTLE" since the number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons is greater than the number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons. Example 3: For the third example, N = 4 and the array A = [11, 12, 13, 14]. The 1^st soldier is holding 11 weapons (which is odd), the 2^nd soldier is holding 12 weapons (which is even), the 3^rd soldier is holding 13 weapons (which is odd), and the 4^th soldier is holding 14 weapons (which is even). The number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons = 2, and number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons = 2. Notice that we have an equal number of people holding even number of weapons and odd number of weapons. The answer here is "NOT READY" since the number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons is not strictly greater than the number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons. Example 4: For the fourth example, N = 3 and the array A = [2, 3, 4]. The 1^st soldier is holding 2 weapons (which is even), the 2^nd soldier is holding 3 weapons (which is odd), and the 3^rd soldier is holding 4 weapons (which is even). The number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons = 2, and number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons = 1. Hence, the answer is "READY FOR BATTLE" since the number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons is greater than the number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons. Example 5: For the fifth example, N = 5 and the array A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The 1^st soldier is holding 1 weapon (which is odd), the 2^nd soldier is holding 2 weapons (which is even), the 3^rd soldier is holding 3 weapons (which is odd), the 4^th soldier is holding 4 weapons (which is even), and the 5^th soldier is holding 5 weapons (which is odd). The number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons = 2, and number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons = 3. Hence, the answer is "NOT READY" since the number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons is not greater than the number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons.  
 	A valid parentheses sequence is a non-empty string where each character is either '(' or ')', which satisfies the following constraint:   You can find a way to repeat erasing adjacent pairs of parentheses '()' until it becomes empty.   	For example, '(())' and '()((()()))' are valid parentheses sequences, but ')()(' and '(()' are not.   	Mike has a valid parentheses sequence. He really likes everything about his sequence, except the fact that it is quite long. So Mike has recently decided that he will replace his parentheses sequence with a new one in the near future. But not every valid parentheses sequence will satisfy him. To help you understand his requirements we'll introduce the pseudocode of function F(S):   	FUNCTION F( S - a valid parentheses sequence ) 	BEGIN 		balance = 0 		max_balance = 0 		FOR index FROM 1 TO LENGTH(S) 		BEGIN 			if S[index] == '(' then balance = balance + 1 			if S[index] == ')' then balance = balance - 1 			max_balance = max( max_balance, balance ) 		END 		RETURN max_balance 	END  	In other words, F(S) is equal to the maximal balance over all prefixes of S.   	Let's denote A as Mike's current parentheses sequence, and B as a candidate for a new one. Mike is willing to replace A with B if F(A) is equal to F(B). He would also like to choose B with the minimal possible length amongst ones satisfying the previous condition. If there are several such strings with the minimal possible length, then Mike will choose the least one lexicographically, considering '(' to be less than ')'.   	Help Mike!   Input  	The first line of the input contains one integer T denoting the number of testcases to process.   	The only line of each testcase contains one string A denoting Mike's parentheses sequence. It is guaranteed that A only consists of the characters '(' and ')'. It is also guaranteed that A is a valid parentheses sequence.   Output  	The output should contain exactly T lines, one line per each testcase in the order of their appearance. The only line of each testcase should contain one string B denoting the valid parentheses sequence that should be chosen by Mike to replace A.   Constraints 1 ≤ T ≤ 5; 1 ≤ |A| ≤ 100000(10^5).  Example Input: 1 ()((()()))  Output: ((()))  
 Chef likes problems involving arrays. Unfortunately, the last one he tried to solve didn't quite get solved.   Chef has an array A of N positive numbers. He wants to find the number of subarrays for which the sum and product of elements are equal.   Please help Chef find this number.   Input The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The first line of each test contains the integer N. The next line contains N integers — A1, A2, ..., AN — denoting the array.  Output For each test case, output a single line with the answer for the instance.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 50 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 1 ≤ Ai ≤ 10^9^ A1 * A2 * ... * An ≤ 10^9^   Example  Input: 3 3 1 3 2 4 4 1 2 1 6 1 2 2 2 2 1  Output: 4 5 9  Explanation:  Example case 1. There are 4 such subarrays: A[1..1], A[2..2], A[3..3], A[1..3]. Consider A[1..3], sum = 1 + 3 + 2 = 6, product = 1 * 3 * 2 = 6.  
  Chef has a sequence of N numbers. He like a sequence better if the sequence contains his favorite sequence as a substring.   Given the sequence and his favorite sequence(F) check whether the favorite sequence is contained in the sequence  Input  The first line will contain the number of test cases and are followed by the cases. Each test case consists of four lines: The length of the sequence, the sequence N,the length of F and the sequence F   Output  Print "Yes" if the sequence contains the favourite sequence int it otherwise print "No"   Constraints  1<=T<=10 1 1  Input: 2 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 3 2 3 4 6 22 5 6 33 1 4 2 4 15  Output: Yes No 
Chef has found two very old sheets of paper, each of which originally contained a string of lowercase Latin letters. The strings on both the sheets have equal lengths. However, since the sheets are very old, some letters have become unreadable. Chef would like to estimate the difference between these strings. Let's assume that the first string is named S1, and the second S2. The unreadable symbols are specified with the question mark symbol '?'. The difference between the strings equals to the number of positions i, such that S1i is not equal to S2i, where S1i and S2i denote the symbol at the i the position in S1 and S2, respectively. Chef would like to know the minimal and the maximal difference between the two strings, if he changes all unreadable symbols to lowercase Latin letters. Now that you're fully aware of Chef's programming expertise, you might have guessed that he needs you help solving this problem as well. Go on, help him!  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of a test case contains a string S1. The second line of a test case contains a string S2. Both strings consist of lowercase Latin letters and question marks in places where the symbols are unreadable.  Output For each test case, output the minimal and the maximal difference between two given strings separated with a single space.  Constraints   1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ |S1|, |S2| ≤ 100 Example Input: 3 a?c ??b ???a ???a ?abac aba?w  Output: 1 3 0 3 3 5  Explanation Example case 1. You can change the question marks in the strings so that you obtain S1 = abc and S2 = abb. Then S1 and S2 will differ in one position. On the other hand, you can change the letters so that S1 = abc and S2 = bab. Then, the strings will differ in all three positions. Example case 2. Change the question marks this way: S1 = dcba, S2 = dcba, then the strings will differ in 0 positions. You can also change the question marks so that S1 = aaaa, S2 = dcba, then the strings will differ in 3 positions. Example case 3. Change the question marks this way: S1 = aabac, S2 = abaaw, then the strings will differ in 3 positions. Then, change the question marks this way: S1 = xabac, S2 = abayw, then they will differ in 5 positions. 
Little Malvika is very peculiar about colors. On her birthday, her mom wanted to buy balloons for decorating the house. So she asked her about her color preferences. The sophisticated little person that Malvika is, she likes only two colors — amber and brass. Her mom bought n balloons, each of which was either amber or brass in color. You are provided this information in a string s consisting of characters 'a' and 'b' only, where 'a' denotes that the balloon is amber, where 'b' denotes it being brass colored.   When Malvika saw the balloons, she was furious with anger as she wanted all the balloons of the same color. In her anger, she painted some of the balloons with the opposite color (i.e., she painted some amber ones brass and vice versa) to make all balloons appear to be the same color. As she was very angry, it took her a lot of time to do this, but you can probably show her the right way of doing so, thereby teaching her a lesson to remain calm in difficult situations, by finding out the minimum number of balloons needed to be painted in order to make all of them the same color.   Input  The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The first and only line of each test case contains a string s.   Output  For each test case, output a single line containing an integer — the minimum number of flips required.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, where n denotes to the length of the string s.   Example Input: 3 ab bb baaba  Output: 1 0 2  Explanation In the first example, you can change amber to brass or brass to amber. In both the cases, both the balloons will have same colors. So, you will need to paint 1 balloon. So the answer is 1.  In the second example, As the color of all the balloons is already the same, you don't need to paint any of them. So, the answer is 0.  
Chef has just started Programming, he is in first year of Engineering. Chef is reading about Relational Operators. Relational Operators are operators which check relatioship between two values. Given two numerical values A and B you need to help chef in finding the relationship between them that is, First one is greater than second or, First one is less than second or, First and second one are equal.    Input First line contains an integer T, which denotes the number of testcases.

After visiting a childhood friend, Chef wants to get back to his home. Friend lives at the first street, and Chef himself lives at the N-th (and the last) street. Their city is a bit special: you can move from the X-th street to the Y-th street if and only if 1 <= Y - X <= K, where K is the integer value that is given to you. Chef wants to get to home in such a way that the product of all the visited streets' special numbers is minimal (including the first and the N-th street). Please, help him to find such a product.  Input The first line of input consists of two integer numbers - N and K - the number of streets and the value of K respectively. The second line consist of N numbers  - A1, A2, ..., AN respectively, where Ai equals to the special number of the i-th street.  Output Please output the value of the minimal possible product, modulo 1000000007.  Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ Ai ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ K ≤ N   Example Input: 4 2 1 2 3 4.

 Tomya is a girl. She loves Chef Ciel very much.   Tomya like a positive integer p, and now she wants to get a receipt of Ciel's restaurant whose total price is exactly p. The current menus of Ciel's restaurant are shown the following table.   Name of Menuprice eel flavored water1 deep-fried eel bones2 clear soup made with eel livers4 grilled eel livers served with grated radish8 savory egg custard with eel16 eel fried rice (S)32 eel fried rice (L)64 grilled eel wrapped in cooked egg128 eel curry rice256 grilled eel over rice512 deluxe grilled eel over rice1024 eel full-course2048   Note that the i-th menu has the price 2^i-1 (1 ≤ i ≤ 12).   Since Tomya is a pretty girl, she cannot eat a lot. So please find the minimum number of menus whose total price is exactly p. Note that if she orders the same menu twice, then it is considered as two menus are ordered. (See Explanations for details)   Input  The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains an integer p.   Output  For each test case, print the minimum number of menus whose total price is exactly p.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 5 1 ≤ p ≤ 100000 (10^5) There exists combinations of menus whose total price is exactly p.   Sample Input 4 10 256 255 4096  Sample Output 2 1 8 2  Explanations  In the first sample, examples of the menus whose total price is 10 are the following: 1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1 = 10 (10 menus) 1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+2 = 10 (9 menus) 2+2+2+2+2 = 10 (5 menus) 2+4+4 = 10 (3 menus) 2+8 = 10 (2 menus) Here the minimum number of menus is 2.   In the last sample, the optimal way is 2048+2048=4096 (2 menus). Note that there is no menu whose price is 4096. 
After a long time, Chef has finally decided to renovate his house. Chef's house has N rooms in it numbered from 1 to N. Each room is currently painted in one of the red, blue or green colors. Your are given configuration of colors of his house by a string S consisting of N characters. In this string, color red will be denoted by 'R', green by 'G' and blue by 'B'.   Chef does not like current painting configuration that much and would like to repaint the house such that each room has same color. For painting, Chef has all the 3 color paints available and mixing any 2 color paints will result into 3rd color paint i.e  R + B = G B + G = R G + R = B   For example, painting a room having red color before with green color paint will make the color of room blue.   Also, Chef has many buckets of paint of each color. Simply put, you can assume that he will not run out of paint.  Being extraordinary lazy, our little chef does not want to work much and therefore, he has asked you to find the minimum number of rooms he has to repaint (possibly zero) in order to have all the rooms with same color. Can you please help him?  Input First line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. First line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the number of rooms in the chef's house. Next line of each test case contains a string S denoting the current color configuration of rooms.  Output For each test case, Print the minimum number of rooms need to be painted in order to have all the rooms painted with same color i.e either red, blue or green.  Constraints   1 ≤ T ≤ 10   1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5   Si = {'R','G','B'}    Scoring  Example Input  3 3 RGR 3 RRR 3 RGB  Output  1 0 2  Explanation:  Test 1: Chef prefers to paint room 2 with blue color such that the resulting color will be red and all the rooms have same color i.e red. Test 2: Given configuration has all the rooms painted with red color and therefore, chef does not need to do painting work at all. Test 3: One possible way of renovation is to paint room 1 with green color, room 2 with red color such that all rooms have same color i.e blue.  
 The Chef likes to stay in touch with his staff. So, the Chef, the head server, and the sous-chef all carry two-way transceivers so they can stay in constant contact. Of course, these transceivers have a limited range so if two are too far apart, they cannot communicate directly.   The Chef invested in top-of-the-line transceivers which have a few advanced features. One is that even if two people cannot talk directly because they are out of range, if there is another transceiver that is close enough to both, then the two transceivers can still communicate with each other using the third transceiver as an intermediate device.   There has been a minor emergency in the Chef's restaurant and he needs to communicate with both the head server and the sous-chef right away. Help the Chef determine if it is possible for all three people to communicate with each other, even if two must communicate through the third because they are too far apart.   Input  The first line contains a single positive integer T ≤ 100 indicating the number of test cases to follow. The first line of each test case contains a positive integer R ≤ 1,000 indicating that two transceivers can communicate directly without an intermediate transceiver if they are at most R meters away from each other. The remaining three lines of the test case describe the current locations of the Chef, the head server, and the sous-chef, respectively. Each such line contains two integers X,Y (at most 10,000 in absolute value) indicating that the respective person is located at position X,Y.   Output  For each test case you are to output a single line containing a single string. If it is possible for all three to communicate then you should output "yes". Otherwise, you should output "no".   To be clear, we say that two transceivers are close enough to communicate directly if the length of the straight line connecting their X,Y coordinates is at most R.   Example  Input: 3 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 2 0 1 0 0 1 0 2 0 0 0 2 2 1   Output: yes yes no  
Chef is on a vacation these days, so his friend Chefza is trying to solve Chef's everyday tasks. Today's task is to make a sweet roll. Rolls are made by a newly invented cooking machine. The machine is pretty universal - it can make lots of dishes and Chefza is thrilled about this. To make a roll, Chefza has to set all the settings to specified integer values. There are lots of settings, each of them set to some initial value. The machine is pretty complex and there is a lot of cooking to be done today, so Chefza has decided to use only two quick ways to change the settings. In a unit of time, he can pick one setting (let's say its current value is v) and change it in one of the following ways.  If v is even, change this setting to v/2. If v is odd, change it to (v − 1)/2. Change setting to 2 × v  The receipt is given as a list of integer values the settings should be set to. It is guaranteed that each destination setting can be represented as an integer power of 2. Since Chefza has just changed his profession, he has a lot of other things to do. Please help him find the minimum number of operations needed to set up a particular setting of the machine. You can prove that it can be done in finite time.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains two integers A and B denoting the initial and desired values of the setting, respectively.  Output For each test case, output a single line containing minimum number of operations Chefza has to perform in order to set up the machine.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 200 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^7 1 ≤ B ≤ 10^7, and B is an integer power of 2   Example Input: 6 1 1 2 4 3 8 4 16 4 1 1 4  Output: 0 1 4 2 2 2  Explanation  In the first test case, you don't need to do anything. In the second test case, you need to multiply 2 by 2 and get 4. This is done in 1 operation. In the third test case, you need to obtain 1 from 3 and then multiply it by 2 three times to obtain 8. A total of 4 operations. In the fourth test case, multiply 4 by 2 twice. In the fifth test case, divide 4 by 2 twice. In the sixth test case, multiply 1 by 2 twice.  
There are 100 houses located on a straight line. The first house is numbered 1 and the last one is numbered 100. Some M houses out of these 100 are occupied by cops. Thief Devu has just stolen PeePee's bag and is looking for a house to hide in. PeePee uses fast 4G Internet and sends the message to all the cops that a thief named Devu has just stolen her bag and ran into some house. Devu knows that the cops run at a maximum speed of x houses per minute in a straight line and they will search for a maximum of y minutes. Devu wants to know how many houses are safe for him to escape from the cops. Help him in getting this information.  Input First line contains T, the number of test cases to follow. First line of each test case contains 3 space separated integers: M, x and y. For each test case, the second line contains M space separated integers which represent the house numbers where the cops are residing.  Output For each test case, output a single line containing the number of houses which are safe to hide from cops.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4 1 ≤ x, y, M ≤ 10   Example Input: 3 4 7 8 12 52 56 8 2 10 2 21 75 2 5 8 10 51  Output: 0 18 9  Explanation Example 1 : Cops in house 12 can cover houses 1 to 68, and cops in house 52 can cover the rest of the houses. So, there is no safe house. Example 2 : Cops in house 21 can cover houses 1 to 41, and cops in house 75 can cover houses 55 to 95, leaving houses numbered 42 to 54, and 96 to 100 safe. So, in total 18 houses are safe. 
 Grapes of Coderpur are very famous. Devu went to the market and saw that there were N people selling grapes. He didn’t like it because things were not very structured. So, he gave a task to Dhinwa to make things better. If Dhinwa successfully completes the task, Devu will be happy.   Devu wants to change the number of grapes in a bucket of zero or more sellers in such a way that the GCD  of all the number of grapes is divisible by K. Dhinwa can add or remove any number of grapes from each of the buckets. Adding or removing a grape will be counted as an operation. Also after the operation, none of the seller’s bucket should be empty.   Help Dhinwa in finding the minimum number of operations needed to make Devu happy.   Input  First line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. For each test case, first line will contain an integer N denoting the number of buckets and integer K.  Next line contains N space separated integers denoting the number of grapes in each of the bucket.   Output For each test case, print a single integer representing the answer of that test case.  Constraints  Example Input: 2 2 2 3 5 3 7 10 16 18  Output: 2 8   Explanation  For the first test case, add or remove 1 grape in each of the bucket.   For the second test case, remove three grapes in the first bucket, remove two grapes from the second bucket and add three grapes in the third bucket.  
The faculty of application management and consulting services (FAMCS) of the Berland State University (BSU) has always been popular among Berland's enrollees. This year, N students attended the entrance exams, but no more than K will enter the university. In order to decide who are these students, there are series of entrance exams. All the students with score strictly greater than at least (N-K) students' total score gets enrolled. In total there are E entrance exams, in each of them one can score between 0 and M points, inclusively. The first E-1 exams had already been conducted, and now it's time for the last tribulation. Sergey is the student who wants very hard to enter the university, so he had collected the information about the first E-1 from all N-1 enrollees (i.e., everyone except him). Of course, he knows his own scores as well. In order to estimate his chances to enter the University after the last exam, Sergey went to a fortune teller. From the visit, he learnt about scores that everyone except him will get at the last exam. Now he wants to calculate the minimum score he needs to score in order to enter to the university. But now he's still very busy with minimizing the amount of change he gets in the shops, so he asks you to help him.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains four space separated integers N, K, E, M denoting the number of students, the maximal number of students who'll get enrolled, the total number of entrance exams and maximal number of points for a single exam, respectively. The following N-1 lines will contain E integers each, where the first E-1 integers correspond to the scores of the exams conducted. The last integer corresponds to the score at the last exam, that was predicted by the fortune-teller. The last line contains E-1 integers denoting Sergey's score for the first E-1 exams.  Output  For each test case, output a single line containing the minimum score Sergey should get in the last exam in order to be enrolled. If Sergey doesn't have a chance to be enrolled, output "Impossible" (without quotes).   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 5 1 ≤ K < N ≤ 10^4 1 ≤ M ≤ 10^9 1 ≤ E ≤ 4   Example Input: 1 4 2 3 10 7 7 7 4 6 10 7 10 9 9 9  Output: 4  Explanation Example case 1. If Sergey gets 4 points at the last exam, his score will be equal to 9+9+4=22. This will be the second score among all the enrollees - the first one will get 21, the second one will get 20 and the third will have the total of 26. Thus, Sergey will enter the university. 
 The most important part of a GSM network is so called Base Transceiver Station (BTS). These transceivers form the areas called cells (this term gave the name to the cellular phone) and every phone connects to the BTS with the strongest signal (in a little simplified view). Of course, BTSes need some attention and technicians need to check their function periodically.  The technicians faced a very interesting problem recently. Given a set of BTSes to visit, they needed to find the shortest path to visit all of the given points and return back to the central company building. Programmers have spent several months studying this problem but with no results. They were unable to find the solution fast enough. After a long time, one of the programmers found this problem in a conference article. Unfortunately, he found that the problem is so called "Traveling Salesman Problem" and it is very hard to solve. If we have N BTSes to be visited, we can visit them in any order, giving us N! possibilities to examine. The function expressing that number is called factorial and can be computed as a product  1.2.3.4....N. The number is very high even for a relatively small N. The programmers understood they had no chance to solve the problem. But because they have already received the research grant from the government, they needed to continue with their studies and produce at least some results. So they started to study behavior of the factorial function. For example, they defined the function Z. For any positive integer N, Z(N) is the number of zeros at the end of the decimal form of number N!. They noticed that this function never decreases. If we have two numbers N1<N2, then  Z(N1) <= Z(N2). It is because we can never "lose" any trailing zero by multiplying by any positive number. We can only get new and new zeros. The function Z is very interesting, so we need a computer program that can determine its value efficiently.  Input There is a single positive integer T on the first line of input (equal to about 100000). It stands for the number of numbers to follow. Then there are T lines, each containing exactly one positive integer number N, 1 <= N <= 1000000000.  Output For every number N, output a single line containing the single non-negative integer Z(N).  Example Sample Input:  6 3 60 100 1024 23456 8735373  Sample Output:  0 14 24 253 5861 2183837

  Forgotten languages (also known as extinct languages) are languages that are no longer in use. Such languages were, probably, widely used before and no one could have ever imagined that they will become extinct at some point. Unfortunately, that is what happened to them. On the happy side of things, a language may be dead, but some of its words may continue to be used in other languages.   Using something called as the Internet, you have acquired a dictionary of N words of a forgotten language. Meanwhile, you also know K phrases used in modern languages. For each of the words of the forgotten language, your task is to determine whether the word is still in use in any of these K modern phrases or not.   Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.   The first line of a test case description contains two space separated positive integers N and K.   The second line of the description contains N strings denoting a dictionary of the forgotten language.   Each of the next K lines of the description starts with one positive integer L denoting the number of words in the corresponding phrase in modern languages. The integer is followed by L strings (not necessarily distinct) denoting the phrase.   Output For each test case, output a single line containing N tokens (space-separated): if the i^th word of the dictionary exists in at least one phrase in modern languages, then you should output YES as the i^th token, otherwise NO.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 20 1 ≤ N ≤ 100 1 ≤ K, L ≤ 50 1 ≤ length of any string in the input ≤ 5   Example Input: 2 3 2 piygu ezyfo rzotm 1 piygu 6 tefwz tefwz piygu ezyfo tefwz piygu 4 1 kssdy tjzhy ljzym kegqz 4 kegqz kegqz kegqz vxvyj  Output: YES YES NO NO NO NO YES  
Today is Chef's birthday. His mom has surprised him with truly fruity gifts: 2 fruit baskets. The first basket contains N apples, and the second one contains M oranges. Chef likes apples and oranges very much but he likes them equally, and therefore, wants to have the minimum possible difference between the number of apples and oranges he has. To do so, he can purchase 1 apple or 1 orange by paying exactly 1 gold coin (that's some expensive fruit, eh?). Chef can purchase fruits at most K times (as he has only K gold coins in his pocket) to make the difference the minimum possible. Our little Chef is busy in celebrating his birthday to the fullest, and therefore, he has handed this job to his best friend — you. Can you help him by finding the minimum possible difference he can achieve between the number of apples and orange he owns?  Input The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The first and only line of each test case contains 3 space separated integers — N, M and K — denoting the number of apples, number of oranges, and number of gold coins our little Chef has.  Output For each test case, output the minimum possible difference between the number of apples and oranges that Chef can achieve.  Constraints   1 ≤ T ≤ 100   1 ≤ N, M, K ≤ 100    Example Input  3 3 4 1 5 2 1 3 4 3  Output 0 2 0  Explanation  Test 1: Chef will buy 1 apple by paying 1 gold coin and will have equal number of apples and oranges. Test 2: Chef will buy 1 orange by paying 1 gold coin and will have 5 apples and 3 oranges.

Tuzik is a little dog. But despite the fact he is still a puppy he already knows about the pretty things that coins are. He knows that for every coin he can get very tasty bone from his master. He believes that some day he will find a treasure and have loads of bones. And finally he found something interesting. A wooden chest containing N coins! But as you should remember, Tuzik is just a little dog, and so he can't open it by himself. Actually, the only thing he can really do is barking. He can use his barking to attract nearby people and seek their help. He can set the loudness of his barking very precisely, and therefore you can assume that he can choose to call any number of people, from a minimum of 1, to a maximum of K. When people come and open the chest they divide all the coins between them in such a way that everyone will get the same amount of coins and this amount is maximal possible. If some coins are not used they will leave it on the ground and Tuzik will take them after they go away. Since Tuzik is clearly not a fool, he understands that his profit depends on the number of people he will call. While Tuzik works on his barking, you have to find the maximum possible number of coins he can get.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each of next T lines contains 2 space-separated integers: N and K, for this test case.  Output For each test case output one integer - the maximum possible number of coins Tuzik can get.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 50 1 ≤ N, K ≤ 10^5   Example Input: 2 5 2 11 3  Output: 1 2  Explanation In the first example he should call two people. Each of them will take 2 coins and they will leave 1 coin for Tuzik. In the second example he should call 3 people.  
Tanu has got interested in signs and gestures that we use for communication. One such gesture is the head-bob.When we want to signal "Yes" to someone, we move the head up-and-down. For "No", the head is moved left-and-right, rotating about the vertical axis. There is a peculiar way of gesturing "Yes", commonly seen in India, by moving head sideways (rotating about the forward-back axis). This is called the  Indian head-bob. Tanu observed many people on the railways station, and made a list of gestures that they made. Usual "Yes" gesture is recorded as "Y", no as "N" and Indian "Yes" gesture as "I". (Assume no foreigner uses the Indian "Yes" gesture and vice-versa). Identify which of them were Indians, which were not Indian, and which one you cannot be sure about.  Input First line contains T, number of people observed by Tanu.Each person is described in two lines. First line of the description contains a single integer N, the number of gestures recorded for this person. Next line contains a string of N characters, each character can be "Y", "N" or "I".  Output For each person, print "INDIAN" if he/she is from India, "NOT INDIAN" if not from India, and "NOT SURE" if the information is insufficient to make a decision.  Constraints  For 30 points: 1 ≤ T,N ≤ 100For 70 points: 1 ≤ T,N ≤ 1000 Example Input: 35NNNYY6NNINNI4NNNNOutput: NOT INDIANINDIANNOT SURE 
Pooja would like to withdraw X $US from an ATM.

There are N students living in the dormitory of Berland State University. Each of them sometimes wants to use the kitchen, so the head of the dormitory came up with a timetable for kitchen's usage in order to avoid the conflicts:  The first student starts to use the kitchen at the time 0 and should finish the cooking not later than at the time A1. The second student starts to use the kitchen at the time A1 and should finish the cooking not later than at the time A2. And so on. The N-th student starts to use the kitchen at the time AN-1 and should finish the cooking not later than at the time AN  The holidays in Berland are approaching, so today each of these N students wants to cook some pancakes. The i-th student needs Bi units of time to cook. The students have understood that probably not all of them will be able to cook everything they want. How many students will be able to cook without violating the schedule?  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of students. The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the moments of time by when the corresponding student should finish cooking. The third line contains N space-separated integers B1, B2, ..., BN denoting the time required for each of the students to cook.  Output For each test case, output a single line containing the number of students that will be able to finish the cooking.  Constraints Should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have. Format it like:  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^4 0 < A1 <  A2 < ... < AN < 10^9 1 ≤ Bi ≤ 10^9   Example Input: 2 3 1 10 15 1 10 3 3 10 20 30 15 5 20  Output: 2 1  Explanation Example case 1. The first student has 1 unit of time - the moment 0. It will be enough for her to cook. The second student has 9 units of time, but wants to cook for 10 units of time, and won't fit in time. The third student has 5 units of time and will fit in time, because needs to cook only for 3 units of time. Example case 2. Each of students has 10 units of time, but only the second one will be able to fit in time. 
 You might have heard about our new goodie distribution program aka the "Laddu Accrual System". This problem is designed to give you a glimpse of its rules. You can read the page once before attempting the problem if you wish, nonetheless we will be providing all the information needed here itself.   Laddu Accrual System is our new goodie distribution program. In this program, we will be distributing Laddus in place of goodies for your winnings and various other activities (described below), that you perform on our system. Once you collect enough number of Laddus, you can then redeem them to get yourself anything from a wide range of CodeChef goodies.   Let us know about various activities and amount of laddus you get corresponding to them.  Contest Win (CodeChef’s Long, Cook-Off, LTIME, or any contest hosted with us) : 300 + Bonus (Bonus = 20 - contest rank). Note that if your rank is > 20, then you won't get any bonus. Top Contributor on Discuss : 300 Bug Finder	: 50 - 1000 (depending on the bug severity). It may also fetch you a CodeChef internship! Contest Hosting	 : 50   You can do a checkout for redeeming laddus once a month. The minimum laddus redeemable at Check Out are 200 for Indians and 400 for the rest of the world.   You are given history of various activities of a user. The user has not redeemed any of the its laddus accrued.. Now the user just wants to redeem as less amount of laddus he/she can, so that the laddus can last for as long as possible. Find out for how many maximum number of months he can redeem the laddus.   Input  The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting number of test cases For each test case:  First line contains an integer followed by a string denoting activities, origin respectively, where activities denotes number of activities of the user, origin denotes whether the user is Indian or the rest of the world. origin can be "INDIAN" or "NON_INDIAN". For each of the next activities lines, each line contains an activity. 			An activity can be of four types as defined above.  Contest Win : Input will be of form of CONTEST_WON rank, where rank denotes the rank of the user. Top Contributor : Input will be of form of TOP_CONTRIBUTOR. Bug Finder : Input will be of form of BUG_FOUND severity, where severity denotes the severity of the bug. Contest Hosting : Input will be of form of CONTEST_HOSTED.       Output  For each test case, find out the maximum number of months for which the user can redeem the laddus accrued.   Constraints  1 ≤ T, activities ≤ 100 1 ≤ rank ≤ 5000 50 ≤ severity ≤ 1000   Example Input: 2 4 INDIAN CONTEST_WON 1 TOP_CONTRIBUTOR BUG_FOUND 100 CONTEST_HOSTED 4 NON_INDIAN CONTEST_WON 1 TOP_CONTRIBUTOR BUG_FOUND 100 CONTEST_HOSTED  Output: 3 1  Explanation In the first example,  For winning contest with rank 1, user gets 300 + 20 - 1 = 319 laddus. For top contributor, user gets 300 laddus. For finding a bug with severity of 100, user gets 100 laddus. For hosting a contest, user gets 50 laddus.   So, overall user gets 319 + 300 + 100 + 50 = 769 laddus. Now, the user is an Indian user, he can redeem only 200 laddus per month. So, for first three months, he will redeem 200 * 3 = 600 laddus. The remaining 169 laddus, he can not redeem as he requires at least 200 laddues in a month to redeem. So, answer is 3.  In the second example, user is a non-Indian user, he can redeem 400 laddues per month. So, in the first month, he will redeem 400 laddus. The remaining 369 laddus, he can not redeem as he requires at least 400 laddues in a month to redeem. So, answer is 1.

Output For each test case output a single line containing an integer corresponding to the number of collisions at the party.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ N, M ≤ 10   Example Input: 2 4 3 111 100 110 000 2 2 10 01  Output: 4 0   Explanation Example Case 1. All three boys like the first girl, so there are (1, 2, 1), (1, 3, 1), (2, 3, 1) collisions with her. Boys 1 and 3 both like the second girl so this is one more collision. Only one boy likes the third girl, so there are no collisions with her and thus we have 4 collisions total. Example Case 2. For each girl there is only one boy who likes her, so there are no collisions at all.

In the second example case, the second and the fourth movies are equally good, but the second movie has a smaller index. 
 You have a matrix of size N * N with rows numbered through 1 to N from top to bottom and columns through 1 to N from left to right. It contains all values from 1 to N^2, i.e. each value from 1 to N^2 occurs exactly once in the matrix.   Now, you start from the cell containing value 1, and from there visit the cell with value 2, and then from there visit the cell with value 3, and so on till you have visited cell containing the number N^2. In a single step, you can move from a cell to one of its adjacent cells. Two cells are said to be adjacent to each other if they share an edge between them.   Find out minimum number of steps required.   For example, if matrix is  1 3 2 4  You start from cell containing value 1 (i.e. (1,1)) and you want to visit cell with value 2 (i.e. (2,1)). Now, from cell (2,1) you have to visit cell (1,2), which can be done is 2 steps (First we go from (2, 1) to (1, 1) and then to (1, 2), total 2 steps). Finally you move to cell where value 4 is present in 1 step. So, total number of steps required is 4.   Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the size of matrix.

 Now that Chef has finished baking and frosting his cupcakes, it's time to package them. Chef has N cupcakes, and needs to decide how many cupcakes to place in each package. Each package must contain the same number of cupcakes. Chef will choose an integer A between 1 and N, inclusive, and place exactly A cupcakes into each package.  Chef makes as many packages as possible. Chef then gets to eat the remaining cupcakes. Chef enjoys eating cupcakes very much. Help Chef choose the package size A that will let him eat as many cupcakes as possible.   Input  Input begins with an integer T, the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a single integer N, the number of cupcakes.   Output  For each test case, output the package size that will maximize the number of leftover cupcakes. If multiple package sizes will result in the same number of leftover cupcakes, print the largest such size.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 1000 2 ≤ N ≤ 100000000 (10^8)   Sample Input 2 2 5  Sample Output 2 3  Explanation  In the first test case, there will be no leftover cupcakes regardless of the size Chef chooses, so he chooses the largest possible size.

Leha is playing a very interesting game. The game will be played on a rectangular grid consisting of N rows and M columns. Initially all the cells of the grid are uncolored. Leha's initial score is zero. At each turn, he chooses some cell that is yet not colored, and colors that cell. The score obtained in this step will be number of neighboring colored cells of the cell that Leha colored in this step. Two cells are neighbors of each other if they share a side between them. The game will end when all the cells are colored. Finally, total score obtained at the end of the game will sum of score obtained in each turn. Leha wants to know what maximum score he can get? Can you please help him in finding this out?  Input The first line contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. T test cases follow. Each of the following T lines contains two space-separated integers N, M denoting the dimensions of the grid.  Output For each test case, output a single line containing an integer corresponding to the maximal possible score Leha can obtain.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ N, M ≤ 1 000   Example Input: 1 2 2  Output: 4  Explanation Leha can obtain total score 4 in the following way.  In the first step, he colors down left cell, all the neighboring cells of this cell are uncolored. So, it adds 0 to total score. In second step, he can color upper right cell, it also adds total 0 to the score. In third step, he can color top left cell. There are two neighboring cell of this cell, both of which are colored. So, this add 2 to the score. In the last step, he can choose the remaining down right cell. There are two neighboring cell of this cell, both of which are colored. So, this also add 2 to the score.   Leha can't obtain a score more than 4. Hence 4 is the answer.  
 Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) is a mathematical notation where every operator follows all of its operands. For instance, to add three and four, one would write "3 4 +" rather than "3 + 4". If there are multiple operations, the operator is given immediately after its second operand; so the expression written "3 − 4 + 5" would be written "3 4 − 5 +" first subtract 4 from 3, then add 5 to that.   Transform the algebraic expression with brackets into RPN form.   You can assume that for the test cases below only single letters will be used, brackets [] will not be used and each expression has only one RPN form (no expressions like a*b*c)    Input  The first line contains t, the number of test cases (less then 100).   Followed by t lines, containing an expression to be translated to RPN form, where the length of the expression is less then 400.   Output  The expressions in RPN form, one per line.   Example  Input: 3 (a+(b*c)) ((a+b)*(z+x)) ((a+t)*((b+(a+c))^(c+d)))  Output: abc*+ ab+zx+* at+bac++cd+^* 
  The citizens of Byteland regularly play a game. They have blocks each denoting some integer from 0 to 9. These are arranged together in a random manner without seeing to form different numbers keeping in mind that the first block is never a 0. Once they form a number they read in the reverse order to check if the number and its reverse is the same. If both are same then the player wins. We call such numbers palindrome Ash happens to see this game and wants to simulate the same in the computer. As the first step he wants to take an input from the user and check if the number is palindrome and declare if the user wins or not   Input  The first line of the input contains T, the number of test cases. This is followed by T lines containing an integer N.   Output  For each input output "wins" if the number is a palindrome and "losses" if not.

 Some programming contest problems are really tricky: not only do they require a different output format from what you might have expected, but also the sample output does not show the difference. For an example, let us look at permutations. A permutation of the integers 1 to n is an ordering of these integers. So the natural way to represent a permutation is to list the integers in this order. With n = 5, a permutation might look like 2, 3, 4, 5, 1. However, there is another possibility of representing a permutation: You create a list of numbers where the i-th number is the position of the integer i in the permutation. Let us call this second possibility an inverse permutation. The inverse permutation for the sequence above is 5, 1, 2, 3, 4.  An ambiguous permutation is a permutation which cannot be distinguished from its inverse permutation. The permutation 1, 4, 3, 2 for example is ambiguous, because its inverse permutation is the same. To get rid of such annoying sample test cases, you have to write a program which detects if a given permutation is ambiguous or not.   Input Specification The input contains several test cases. The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000). Then a permutation of the integers 1 to n follows in the next line. There is exactly one space character between consecutive integers. You can assume that every integer between 1 and n appears exactly once in the permutation.  The last test case is followed by a zero.   Output Specification For each test case output whether the permutation is ambiguous or not. Adhere to the format shown in the sample output.   Sample Input 4 1 4 3 2 5 2 3 4 5 1 1 1 0   Sample Output ambiguous not ambiguous ambiguous

Chef is now a corporate person. He has to attend office regularly. But chef does not want to go to office, rather he wants to stay home and discover different recipes and cook them. In the office where chef works, has two guards who count how many times a person enters into the office building. Though the duty of a guard is 24 hour in a day, but sometimes they fall asleep during their duty and could not track the entry of a person in the office building. But one better thing is that they never fall asleep at the same time. At least one of them remains awake and counts who enters into the office. Now boss of Chef wants to calculate how many times Chef has entered into the building. He asked to the guard and they give him two integers A and B, count of first guard and second guard respectively. Help the boss to count the minimum and maximum number of times Chef could have entered into the office building.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of the T test cases follows.

Output For each test case, output a single line containing two space separated integers, the minimum and maximum number of times Chef could have entered into the office building.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 0 ≤ A, B ≤ 1000000   Example Input: 1 19 17  Output: 19 36  
Princess Rupsa saw one of her friends playing a special game. The game goes as follows:  N+1 numbers occur sequentially (one at a time) from A0 to AN. You must write the numbers on a sheet of paper, such that A0 is written first. The other numbers are written according to an inductive rule — after Ai-1 numbers have been written in a row, then Ai can be written at either end of the row. That is, you first write A0, and then A1 can be written on its left or right to make A0A1 or A1A0, and so on. Ai must be written before writing Aj, for every i < j. For a move in which you write a number Ai (i>0), your points increase by the product of Ai and its neighbour. (Note that for any move it will have only one neighbour as you write the number at an end). Total score of a game is the score you attain after placing all the N + 1 numbers.  Princess Rupsa wants to find out the sum of scores obtained by all possible different gameplays. Two gameplays are different, if after writing down all N + 1 numbers, when we read from left to right, there exists some position i, at which the gameplays have aj and ak written at the i^th position such that j ≠ k. But since she has recently found her true love, a frog Prince, and is in a hurry to meet him, you must help her solve the problem as fast as possible. Since the answer can be very large, print the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.  Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N. The second line contains N + 1 space-separated integers denoting A0 to AN.   Output   For each test case, output a single line containing an integer denoting the answer.    Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ Ai ≤ 10^9   Sub tasks  Example Input: 2 1 1 2 2 1 2 1  Output: 4 14  Explanation  There are 2 possible gameplays. A0A1 which gives score of 2 and  A1A0 which also gives score of 2. So the answer is 2 + 2 = 4  
 Vadim and Roman like discussing challenging problems with each other. One day Vadim told his friend following problem:  Given N points on a plane. Each point p is defined by it's two integer coordinates — px and py. The distance between points a and b is min(|ax - bx|, |ay - by|). You should choose a starting point and make a route visiting every point exactly once, i.e. if we write down numbers of points in order you visit them we should obtain a permutation. Of course, overall distance walked should be as small as possible. The number of points may be up to 40.  "40? Maybe 20? Are you kidding?" – asked Roman. "No, it's not a joke" – replied Vadim. So Roman had nothing to do, but try to solve this problem. Since Roman is really weak in problem solving and you are the only friend, except Vadim, with whom Roman can discuss challenging tasks, he has nobody else to ask for help, but you!   Input Input description. The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of points on a plane. The following N lines contain two space-separated integers each — coordinates of points.  Output Output description. Output the answer for every test case in a separate line. The answer for every test case is a permutation of length N. In case there are several solutions that lead to minimal distance walked, you should choose the lexicographically smallest one. Let P denote such permutation. To make output smaller, you should output H(P). H(P) = P1 xor P2 xor ... xor PN. Have a look at the example and it's explanation for better understanding.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ N ≤ 40 0 ≤ absolute value of each coordinate ≤ 1000 1 ≤ sum over all N in a single test file ≤ 120   Example Input: 2 2 1 2 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 3 Output: 3 0   Explanation For the first test case permutation [1, 2] is optimal.  1 xor 2 = 3.  For the second one both [2, 3, 1] and [1, 3, 2] lead us to the shortest walk, but the second one is lexicographically smaller. So the answer is H([1, 3, 2]) = 1 xor 3 xor 2 = 0 .

After removing 1 greatest and 1 lowest measurement, we get the set {2, 9, 1}. The average value in this set is (2+9+1)/3=4. Example case 2. The average value in the set {2, 9, -10, 25, 1} is (2+9-10+25+1)/5=5.4. Example case 3. After removing the 1 largest and smallest measurements, Sergey will be left with only one measurement, i.e. 1.

 The game of billiards involves two players knocking 3 balls around on a green baize table. Well, there is more to it, but for our purposes this is sufficient.  The game consists of several rounds and in each round both players obtain a score, based on how well they played. Once all the rounds have been played, the total score of each player is determined by adding up the scores in all the rounds and the player with the higher total score is declared the winner.  The Siruseri Sports Club organises an annual billiards game where the top two players of Siruseri play against each other. The Manager of Siruseri Sports Club decided to add his own twist to the game by changing the rules for determining the winner. In his version, at the end of each round the leader and her current lead are calculated. Once all the rounds are over the player who had the maximum lead at the end of any round in the game is declared the winner.   Consider the following score sheet for a game with 5 rounds:       Round     Player 1       Player 2        1             140                 82       2              89                 134       3              90                 110       4              112              106       5              88                  90   The total scores of both players, the leader and the lead after each round for this game is given below:      Round      Player 1       Player 2     Leader     Lead        1               140           	 82        Player 1     58       2               229           	216       Player 1     13       3               319           	326       Player 2      7       4               431           	432       Player 2      1       5               519           	522       Player 2      3   The winner of this game is Player 1 as he had the maximum lead (58 at the end of round 1) during the game.  Your task is to help the Manager find the winner and the winning lead. You may assume that the scores will be such that there will always be a single winner.  That is, there are no ties. Input  The first line of the input will contain a single integer N (N ≤ 10000) indicating the number of rounds in the game.  Lines 2,3,...,N+1 describe the scores of the two players in the N rounds. Line i+1 contains two integer Si and Ti, the scores of the Player 1 and 2 respectively, in round i.  You may assume that 1 ≤ Si ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ Ti ≤ 1000. Output  Your output must consist of a single line containing two integers W and L, where W is 1 or 2 and indicates the winner and L is the maximum lead attained by the winner. Example Input:  5 140 82 89 134 90 110 112 106 88 90  Output:  1 58 
Chef belongs to a very rich family which owns many gold mines. Today, he brought N gold coins and decided to form a triangle using these coins. Isn't it strange? Chef has a unusual way of forming a triangle using gold coins, which is described as follows:  He puts 1 coin in the 1^st row. then puts 2 coins in the 2^nd row. then puts 3 coins in the 3^rd row.  and so on as shown in the given figure.   Chef is interested in forming a triangle with maximum possible height using at most N coins. Can you tell him the maximum possible height of the triangle?  Input The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The first and the only line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the number of gold coins Chef has.  Output For each test case, output a single line containing an integer corresponding to the maximum possible height of the triangle that Chef can get.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^9   Example  Input 3 3 5 7  Output 2 2 3   Explanation  Test 1: Chef can't form a triangle with height > 2 as it requires atleast 6 gold coins. Test 2: Chef can't form a triangle with height > 2 as it requires atleast 6 gold coins. Test 3: Chef can't form a triangle with height > 3 as it requires atleast 10 gold coins. 
Given the list of numbers, you are to sort them in non decreasing order.   Input t – the number of numbers in list, then t lines follow [t <= 10^6]. Each line contains one integer: N [0 <= N <= 10^6]   Output Output given numbers in non decreasing order.  Example Input:  5 5 3 6 7 1  Output:  1 3 5 6 7 
 Chef wants to implement wildcard pattern matching supporting only the wildcard '?'. The wildcard character '?' can be substituted by any single lower case English letter for matching. He has two strings X and Y of equal length, made up of lower case letters and the character '?'. He wants to know whether the strings X and Y can be matched or not.  Input The first line of input contain an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines, the first line contains the string X and the second contains the string Y.  Output For each test case, output a single line with the word Yes if the strings can be matched, otherwise output No.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 50 Both X and Y have equal length and the length is between 1 and 10. Both X and Y consist of lower case letters and the character '?'.   Example Input: 2 s?or? sco?? stor? sco??  Output: Yes No  Explanation  First Example:  There are several ways the two strings can be matched, one of those is "score".   Second Example:  There is no way to match the strings.  
  	A version control system(VCS) is a repository of files, often the files for the source code of computer programs, with monitored access. Every change made to the source is tracked, along with who made the change, why they made it, and references to problems fixed, or enhancements introduced, by the change.   	Version control systems are essential for any form of distributed, collaborative development. Whether it is the history of a wiki page or large software development project, the ability to track each change as it was made, and to reverse changes when necessary can make all the difference between a well managed and controlled process and an uncontrolled ‘first come, first served’ system. It can also serve as a mechanism for due diligence for software projects.   	In this problem we'll consider a simplified model of a development project. Let's suppose, that there are N source files in the project. All the source files are distinct and numbered from 1 to N.   	A VCS, that is used for maintaining the project, contains two sequences of source files. The first sequence contains the source files, that are ignored by the VCS. If a source file is not in the first sequence, then it's considered to be unignored. The second sequence contains the source files, that are tracked by the VCS. If a source file is not in the second sequence, then it's considered to be untracked. A source file can either be or not be in any of these two sequences.   	Your task is to calculate two values: the number of source files of the project, that are both tracked and ignored, and the number of source files of the project, that are both untracked and unignored.   Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of the test case description contains three integers N, M and K denoting the number of source files in the project, the number of ignored source files and the number of tracked source files. The second line contains M distinct integers denoting the sequence A of ignored source files. The sequence is strictly increasing. The third line contains K distinct integers denoting the sequence B of tracked source files. The sequence is strictly increasing.  Output For each test case, output a single line containing two integers: the number of the source files, that are both tracked and ignored, and the number of the source files, that are both untracked and unignored.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ M, K ≤ N ≤ 100 1 ≤ A1 < A2 < ... < AM ≤ N 1 ≤ B1 < B2 < ... < BK ≤ N   Example Input: 2 7 4 6 1 4 6 7 1 2 3 4 6 7 4 2 2 1 4 3 4  Output: 4 1 1 1   Explanation  	In the first test case, the source files {1, 4, 6, 7} are both tracked and ignored, the source file {5} is both untracked and unignored.   	In the second test case, the source file {4} is both tracked and ignored, the source file {2} is both untracked and unignored.  
Chef is going to participate in a new quiz show: "Who dares to be a millionaire?" According to the rules of the game, contestants must answer N questions. The quiz being famous for its difficulty, each question has 26 candidate answers, but only one of which is correct. Answers are denoted by capital Latin letters from A to Z. Chef knows all the questions that can be asked, and for each of them he knows the answer candidate he will choose (some of them can be incorrect). For each question, we'll tell you Chef's answer to it. The game goes on as follows. First, all the questions are shuffled randomly. Then, a contestant is asked these questions one-by-one in the new shuffled order. If the contestant answers any question incorrectly, the game is over. Total winnings of the contestant are calculated as follows. Let X denote the number of questions answered correctly by the contestant. Depending on this value, the winnings are determined: W0 dollars is the amount won for X = 0, W1 dollars is for X = 1, and so on till X = N. Note that the game was invented by a twisted mind, and so a case where Wi ≥ Wi + 1 for some 0 ≤ i ≤ N − 1 is possible. Chef is interested in finding the maximum possible winnings that he can amass.  Input The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The  description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of questions. Next line contains N capital Latin letters denoting the correct answers to these questions. Next line contains N capital Latin letters denoting answers given by Chef to these questions. Next line contains N + 1 space-separated integers W0, W1, ..., WN denoting the winnings for 0, 1, ..., N correct answers.  Output For each test case, output a single line containing the value of maximum possible winnings that Chef can get.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 500 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000 0 ≤ Wi ≤ 10^9   Example Input: 3 5 ABCDE EBCDA 0 10 20 30 40 50 4 CHEF QUIZ 4 3 2 1 0 8 ABBABAAB ABABABAB 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100  Output: 30 4 100   Explanation Example case 1. If questions will be placed in order: 2^nd (Chef's answer is B, which is correct), 3^rd (Chef's answer is C, and it is correct as well), 4^th (Chef's answer is D, and he is right), 5^th (Chef's answer is A but correct answer is E and the game is over), 1^st, Chef will correctly answer 3 questions, and therefore win 30 dollars. Example case 2. Chef's answers for all questions are incorrect, so his winnings are W0 dollars. Example case 3. Since all Wi are equal to 100 dollars, Chef will win this sum in any possible case. 
 The Beginning This is a story of the time when human kind had spread its presence through out the galaxy and had established an empire in its own right . To rule the galaxy effectively and maintain law and order , the galaxy had been divided into sixty four sectors and laws were imposed as to how trade and other activities that were to take place be implemented  , of which the the vitals ones being : One can trade only a fixed amount of commodities , which has been predefined by the senate , in a sector . One can travel only to the sectors just after or before a given sector and in no other way . The map of the galaxy being :             64  63  62  61  60  59  58  57           49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56           48  47  46  45  44  43  42  41           33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40           32  31  30  29  28  27  26  25           17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24           16  15  14  13  12  11  10  09           01  02  03  04  05  06  07  08 If you are in Sector 05 , you can either go to Sector 06 or Sector 04 . If you are in Sector 09 , you can either go to Sector 08 or Sector 10 . To extend the empire further , the Senate decides to send an expedition beyond their current reaches of the Empire . The expedition was to travel through the galaxy following the laws and and get to Sector 64 . There , the Expedition would be fitted with Hyper Drives which would take them beyond the Galaxy . So a crew of the best explorers were chosen for the mission and they left on the Expedition , unaware of what lay ahead .  The Route  The space craft can carry a maximum amount of fuel of 5 units . It starts its journey from Sector 1 , where Earth is located and is given the amount of fuel present on Earth . For every sector traversed into , it loses one unit of fuel . The spacecraft may land in  any sector to refill its fuel supplies . The amount of fuel available on a base varies between 1 to 5 . The space craft has to pick up all the fuel that there is on offer at a given base in accordance with the trade agreements and it can not carry more fuel than its maximum capacity which implies that the maximum fuel on a base station it lands on can not be more than the difference between its maximum fuel capacity and fuel left in its reserve . When it lands on a base station , its data base is uploaded with the information about the amount of fuel present in the next five immediate bases based on which the captain decides their next base halt . The captain decides their halt in a way so as to ensure that they have the maximum amount of fuel left by the time they traverse into the last sector in their current database (which must not be their destination , Sector 64 ) and in case more than one option are available , the one that is farthest from their current location is chosen . In case the last sector on their database is Sector 64 , and the space craft can travel the distance without making any further landings , the captain will ensure that they make no further landings even if by the time they traverse into Sector 64 , they have no fuel left .   The captain also ensures that information about their next halt is sent to the head of the current base station before proceeding so that a rescue mission can be carried in case something goes wrong .

On reaching the final frontier of the Galaxy , Sector 64 , the crew found themselves in a situation they had not anticipated .  The base they were supposed to land on was completely destroyed without any trace . All they found on the base was a Teleport channel , an encrypted key and some encrypted data , apparently left behind by mistake . The captain decided to investigate and find out where the Teleport channel leads to and what information were left behind . To do this , he has to decrypt the key and find a code to decode the information and unlock the Teleport channel .  The key had been encrypted using an ancient encryption algorithm . In this algorithm , a digit is preceded as well as succeeded by a certain number of characters which decides the position of the digit in the unencrypted code .  The encrypted key has the following characters and their relative weight-age :  Z      the basic charcacter ( may be considered of unit value ) Q      equivalent to 3 Z E      equivalent to 5 Z T      equivalent to 7 Z U      equivalent to 9 Z  The characters which precede a digit add to its weight-age and which succeed a digit subtract from its weigh-age . The position of a digit in the unencrypted code is decided on the basis of its weight-age , the digit with the least weight-age is the left most and the digit with the most weight-age is the right most . In case of same weight-age for two digits , the digit that appears later in the encrypted key appears earlier in the unencrypted code .  Example :  ZZZE5UU7QQZZ7T3QQQQ4EEZ  weight-age of 5 : (3x1) + (1x5) - (2x9) = -10 weight-age of 7 : (2x9) - (2x3) - (2x1) = 10 weight-age of second 7 : (2x3)+(2x1) - (1x7) = 1 weight-age of 3 : (1x7) - (4x3) = - 5 weight-age of 4 : (4x3) - (2x5) - (1x1) = 1   Implying the unencrypted code is :  53477  Input  n N1 N2 N3 N4 .................N200 N1 N2 N3 N4 .................N200 ............ ............ n times  Where :  n : Number of test cases . 0 < n < 32000 .

On being teleported through the teleport channel , the crew reach Earth and find that the invaders have attacked the planet . They decide to join the war against the invaders .  Based on information available , the crew of the ship decides to analyze the probability of the Mother-ship of the invaders being in a sector and then focus their attacks on the ones with highest probability .  They decide the probability of the Mother-ship being in a particular sector based on the amount of protection it gets from the supporting Frigates in the grid . There are eight Frigates in the grid and no two of them are in the same sector .  The protection a sector receives from a Frigate is decided as follows :  Every Frigate has the ability to protect any sector in the row , column and diagonal it is located in . But it's ability to protect is maximum when the sector is just adjacent to it in it's row or column ( let us just call it as Protection Status 14 ) and then gradually falls at a rate of 2 units per sector as the distance increases ( as in , the sector next to its adjacent sector has Protection Status as 12 and so on ) . The protection of a sector along its diagonal is half the protection of a sector at same distance along the row or column , as in , the Protection Status of a sector adjacent to a frigate along its diagonals is 7 and it falls of as the distance increases at a rate of 1 unit per sector .  Also , if a sector is protected by more than one frigate , the Protection Status of that sector is the sum of the protections provided by all the Frigates for the sector in the grid .  Example  The map of the galaxy being :                  64  63  62  61  60  59  58  57                49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56                48  47  46  45  44  43  42  41                33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40                32  31  30  29  28  27  26  25                17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24                16  15  14  13  12  11  10  09                01  02  03  04  05  06  07  08    In the 8x8 grid , if a Frigate is at Sector 12  , it protects the following sectors ( with the Protection Status in bracket ) .  Row Elements : 11(14) , 10(12) , 09(10) , 13(14) , 14(12) , 15(10) , 16(08)  . Column Elements : 05(14) , 21(14) , 28(12) , 37(10) , 44(08) , 53 (06) .

If more than one sector has same protection status which also happens to be the highest , the sector numbers are to be output in an increasing order .

 Problem Description: "What is a lobby boy? A lobby boy is completely invisible, yet always in sight. A lobby boy remembers what people hate. A lobby boy anticipates the client's needs before the needs are needed. A lobby boy is, above all, discreet to a fault. Our guests know that their deepest secrets, some of which are frankly rather unseemly, will go with us to our graves. So keep your mouth shut, Zero. "               -M.Gustave Gustave is fond of cakes. Gustave's birthday is falling soon and so Mr.Zero thinks of gifting him N cakes. ( N is the age of M.Gustave ). Zero plans to get some cakes everyday so that he could collect N cakes before M.Gustave's birthday. Assume that the Cakes are hybrid varieties and so are not perishable .Zero decides to buy at-least one cake everyday. He has to collect N cakes within H days .( H being the number of days remaining for Gustave's birthday). But he should not finish collecting the Cakes before Lth day because Zero suspects M.Gustave will find out his birthday present. Zero can collect the Cakes in many ways. Find the number of all possible ways in collecting the Cakes . Note:Print the output mod 10e9 + 7  Input The first line consists of an integer ‘T’, the number of test cases.’T’ test cases follow: Each  test case consists of a single line containing three integers N and L and H   Output For each test case ,output a single line containing  the number of possible ways of collecting the cakes  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ N ≤ 500 1≤L≤ H≤N   Example Input: 1 4  2 3  Output: 6   Explanation Example case 1. One possible way of collecting the cakes is (2,1,1) ie two cakes on the first day and one cake for the next two days. Similarly the remaining possible ways are (1,2,1) (1,1,2) (1,3) (3,1) (2,2) note  : (4) and (1,1,1,1) is not a valid way since he finished collecting before the 2nd day in the former case and in the latter he took more than 3 days

  To attain inner peace  Geek Sundaram  has to pass through the "Hall of Valley of Death". The floor of this hall is a square with length 100 m. It is laid with square tiles of size  1 X 1  arranged over the entire hall. But, at some places in the hall tiles are broken. The moment a person enters the hall, the underworld awakens and dead souls emerge from these broken tiles. The only way to escape from these evil souls is to completely cover the broken locations with magic planks from the room of requirements. Each plank has size 100 X 1 and can only be placed parallel to either sides of the floor. Now Geek Sundaram has to save himself from these evil souls. He figures out that he has to use the minimum number of planks possible. Please help Geek Sundaram to attain inner peace.  Input   The first line of the input is a positive integer t <= 30, denoting the number of halls.  The descriptions for the t halls follow one after the other.  Hall Description:   The first line of the hall description is a positive integer n (n  <=  10000), denoting the number of broken tile locations.  This is followed by the n lines, one for each broken tile location.  Each line contains two integers x y (0 <= x, y < 100), separated by a single space, representing the co-ordinates of the broken tile location.     Output The output should consist of t lines, one for each hall. The k^th line in the output should be an integer mk, the minimum number of planks needed for the k^th hall.     Example Input: 2 3 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4   Output: 1 4    
  Geek Sundaram is extremely anxious. He is in a hectic schedule. He has to study for his assessment the next day, watch FRIENDS tv show (in spite of watching every episode more than 5 times.. :P ), prepare questions for the programming contest and also complete his projects. So his friends try to calm him down by advising whether he can complete all his tasks in the given time period.  Given the time taken (in seconds) to study S, to watch TV W, to prepare questions Q and do project  P  and the total time available until the deadline T, print "YES" if Geek can complete all the tasks within the deadline, otherwise print "NO". (quotes for clarity)  P.S. Geek doesn't have the power to multi task  Input  The first line of the input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases. The description of t test cases follows." The first and the only line of each test case contains five integers S, W, Q, P, T as described in the problem.     Output For each test case, output a single line "YES" or "NO".    Constraints  1 ≤  t  ≤ 10 ^6 1 ≤  S, W, Q, P, T  ≤ 10 ^18     Example Input: 2 10 20 30 40 500 1 2 3 4 5  Output: YES NO    
Abhi and his friends (Shanky,Anku and Pandey) love to play with strings. Abhi invented a simple game. He will give a string S to his friends. Shanky and Anku will play the game while Pandey is just a spectator. Shanky will traverse the string from beginning (left to right) while Anku will traverse from last (right to left). Both have to find the first character they encounter during their traversal,that appears only once in the entire string. Winner will be one whose character is alphabetically more superior(has higher ASCII value). When it is not possible to decide the winner by comparing their characters, Pandey will be the winner.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. Each test case contains a string S having only lowercase alphabets ( a..z ).  Output For each test case, output a single line containing "SHANKY" if Shanky is the winner or "ANKU" if Anku is the winner or "PANDEY" if the winner is Pandey. Output your answer without quotes.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 < |S| ≤ 10^5   Example Input: 3 google breakraekb aman  Output: SHANKY PANDEY ANKU   Explanation Example case 2. Both Shanky and Anku can not find any such character. Hence it is not possible to decide the winner between these two. So Pandey is the winner. 
 In mathematics, the absolute value (or modulus) |a| of a real number a is the numerical value of a without regard to its sign. So, for example, the absolute value of 3 is 3, and the absolute value of -3 is also 3. The absolute value of a number may be thought of as its distance from zero.   Input  There is a single positive integer T on the first line of input. It stands for the number of numbers to follow. Then there are T lines, each containing exactly one integer number N ,  -10000 ≤ N ≤ 10000   Output  For every input number N, output a single line containing the absolute value of N.   Example  Input: 4 -9 -4 6 -1 Output: 9 4 6 1 
Sherlock Holmes has decided to start a new academy to some of the young lads. He has conducted several tests and finally selected N equally brilliant students.Now he don't know whether to train all the N students or not. Now since Holmes was in a confusion, Watson came up with an idea. He wanted to test the obedience of the students. So during the camp, the students were given some Swiss Chocolates as gifts each time when they passed a level.Now some of them have finished eating all the chocolates, some of them had some remaining. Now to test their team chemistry and IQ skills, Watson told the lads to arrange themselves in such a way that,  number of chocolates of the ith kid should be equal to the sum of   (i-1)th kid and (i-2)th kid. Now they have arranged themselves in an order. Now Sherlock announced that he will select the students who have formed the line according to this order. But since there can be many such small groups among the entire N kids, he will select a sequence of kids such that the length of the sequence is maximized, meanwhile satisfying the above condition   Input First line is an integer T which denotes the total number of test cases. Each of the next T lines contains an integer N which denotes, N students. The next line contains N spaced integers.where it denotes the order in which the kids arranged themselves.  Output Each line contains an integer which denotes the maximum number of students among the N students who have arranged themselves according the rule said by Watson.It is guaranteed that Holmes will select atleast 1 or 2 students  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ Each of next N integers ≤ 10^9   Example Input: 2 5 2 3 5 1 2 3 1 2 3  Output: 3 3    Explanation Example case 1. Here the first kid has 2 chocolates, second has 3 chocolates, third kid has 5 chocolates, which is the sum of first kid's total chocolates and second kid's chocolate. Forth student has only 1 chocolate where he did not follow the rule. So the maximum number of kids who arranged themselves in the order was 3. That is students at index 1 to index 3. 
After the huge success of Mangalyaan this year, the ISRO (Indian Space Research Organization) is planning to launch a manned mission to Mars named Mangalyaan-2, in 2015. They obviously would want to select the best astronauts for this space mission. ISRO's research team has examined N available astronauts and computed a fitness score for each of them. It has been decided that astronauts with fitness score greater than or equal to a threshold score P, are eligible for the mission. Can you report the number of eligible astronauts?  Input The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then for each test case, the first line contains two space separated integers N and P denoting number of astronauts and the threshold score respectively. The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the fitness scores of the astronauts. Note: All fitness scores are distinct and are given in descending order.  Output For each test case, output the number of astronauts eligible for the mission on a separate line.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ N ≤ 100 1 ≤ P ≤ 1000 1 ≤ Ai ≤ 1000   Example Input: 3 3 10 7 3 1 3 5 7 3 1 3 1 7 3 1  Output: 0 1 3   Explanation In the first case, no astronauts are selected as none of them have fitness score greater than or equal to 10. In the second case, the astronaut with score 7 is selected. In the third case, all astronauts are selected. 
ISRO has shot to global fame after Mangalyaan. They have decided to build hi-tech ground stations throughout the country which can be used either as a control station or as a launch station (but not as both simultaneously). A control station is one which has all controls to the rocket. A launch station is the site from where a rocket is launched. For a successful launch, ISRO has identified that they need 2 control stations and that these 2 control stations should be equidistant from the launch station. Initially there is only one ground station having index 0, where the headquarters of ISRO is located. Over a period of time, they plan to build more and more ground stations. They can perform two kinds of operations (for given V):    Type 0: Build a new ground station and construct a one-way road from the ground station having index V to the newly built ground station. In other words, if the index of the newly built ground station is W, then a one way road V->W having length = 1 is constructed. The index of the new ground station will be the smallest positive integer which is not the index of any existing ground station. (Of course, this also helps them to keep track of the number of ground stations they have built so far.)    Type 1: Given a ground station with index V, count how many unordered pairs (P, Q) of ground stations exist such that the ground stations P and Q are both reachable from V (paths from V to P and V to Q exist),  and there exists a ground station R (need not be reachable from V), such that distance(P, R) = distance(Q, R), R ≠ P, R ≠ Q and P ≠ Q. Of course, ISRO wants to know this information beforehand since such pairs (P, Q) are possible candidates for control stations, and R is a possible candidate for the launch station.     Adding more explanation "Given a ground station with index V, count how many unordered pairs (P, Q) of ground stations exist such that the ground stations P and Q are both reachable from V (paths from V to P and V to Q exist), and there exists a ground station R (need not be reachable from V), such that distance(P,R) = distance(Q, R), R ≠ P, R ≠ Q and P ≠ Q."  As this says, there need not be path from R->P or P->R. How ever please use the following as definition of distance.  Distance(X, Y) = Number of roads in the unique path from X to Y, if the given road network were bi-directional.  Please note that, V->P and V->Q should still exist in directed road network.   Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer M denoting the number of operations. Each of the next M lines contain 2 integers -  type and V. if type = 0, then perform type 0 operation (for given V). if type = 1, then perform type 1 operation (for given V).  Output For each test case, for each query of type 1, you must print the answer to the query on a separate line.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 5 1 ≤ M ≤ 100000 0 ≤ type ≤ 1 For both type of operations 0 & 1, the given ground station V would have already been built.   Example Input: 2 4 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 6 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 2 1 1  Output: 0 1 1 2   Explanation Example case 1: First operation is of type 1. There is only 1 ground station (with index 0), so number of pairs are 0. Second operation is of type 0. A new ground station with index 1 is built, and a road from 0->1 (having length 1) is added. Third operation is of type 0 again. A new ground station with index 2 is built, and a road from 1->2 (having length 1) is added. Fourth operation is of type 1. There are 3 ground stations now. (0, 2) is the only valid pair as there exists ground station 1 with distance(2, 1) = distance(0, 1) = 1, and both the stations 0 & 2 are reachable from 0. Example case 2: There are 2 operations of type 1. For the first one, (0, 2) is the only valid pair, and for the second one, there are 2 valid pairs pairs - (2, 3) and (1, 4). 
"The Mars Orbiter Mission probe lifted-off from the First Launch Pad at Satish Dhawan Space Centre (Sriharikota Range SHAR), Andhra Pradesh, using a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) rocket C25 at 09:08 UTC (14:38 IST) on 5 November 2013". The secret behind this successful launch was the launch pad that ISRO used. An important part of the launch pad is the launch tower. It is the long vertical structure which supports the rocket. ISRO now wants to build a better launch pad for their next mission. For this, ISRO has acquired a long steel bar, and the launch tower can be made by cutting a segment from the bar. As part of saving the cost, the bar they have acquired is not homogeneous. The bar is made up of several blocks, where the i^th block has durability S[i], which is a number between 0 and 9. A segment is defined as any contiguous group of one or more blocks. If they cut out a segment of the bar from i^th block to j^th block (i<=j), then the durability of the resultant segment is given by ( S[i]*10^(j-i) + S[i+1]*10^(j-i-1) + S[i+2]*10^(j-i-2) + … + S[j] * 10^(0) ) % M. In other words, if W(i,j) is the base-10 number formed by concatenating the digits S[i], S[i+1], S[i+2], …, S[j], then the durability of the segment (i,j) is W(i,j) % M. For technical reasons that ISRO will not disclose, the durability of the segment used for building the launch tower should be exactly L. Given S and M, find the number of ways ISRO can cut out a segment from the steel bar whose durability is L.  Input The first line contains a string S. The i^th character of this string represents the durability of i^th segment. The next line contains a single integer Q, denoting the number of queries. Each of the next Q lines contain two space separated integers, denoting M and L.  Output For each query, output the number of ways of cutting the bar on a separate line.  Constraints  1 ≤ |S| ≤ 2 * 10^4 Q ≤ 5 0 < M < 500 0 ≤ L < M   Example Input: 23128765 3 7 2 9 3 15 5  Output: 9 4 5   Explanation For M=9, L=3, the substrings whose remainder is 3 when divided by 9 are: 3, 31287, 12 and 876. 
ISRO is planning to build a landing platform on MARS as a part of MOM. It has selected a small 2-D rectangular region for the same, and every point in the region has a strength associated with it. The landing platform should be in the form of a cross (see definition below for more details) and as strong as possible. The selected 2-D rectangular region has M * N points represented by (x, y), for all 0 <= x < M, 0 <= y < N. Let W[i][j] denote the strength of the point (i, j). We define a cross as follows:    It consists of 2 line segments of equal length. The end points of the line segments should coincide with any of the given M * N points.   Each of the line segments are at an angle of 45° with both the X & Y axis.   Both the line segments intersect exactly at one point, and their centres coincide. (i.e) if the 2 line segments are represented by { (x11, y11), (x12, y12) }, { (x21, y21), (x22, y22)  }, then (x11+x12) / 2 = (x21+x22) / 2 and (y11+y12) / 2 = (y21+y22) / 2. The point where the 2 line segments intersect is called the center of the cross.   Each line segment of the cross should have a non-zero length. Hence, a single point cannot be considered as a cross.    The strength of a cross is defined as the sum of strengths of all points that lie on it. Your task is to find the cross with maximum strength, which ISRO would like to use as the landing platform.  Input The first line contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then for each test case, the first line contains two integers M and N. Each of the following M lines, contain N space separated integers, where the j^th integer on the i^th line denotes W[i-1][j-1], for all 1 <= i <= M, 1 <= j <= N.  Output For each test case, output a single integer denoting the strength of the maximum-strength cross, on a separate line  Constraints  T ≤ 100 2 ≤ M ≤ 100 2 ≤ N ≤ 100 -10^6 ≤ W[i][j] ≤ 10^6   Example Input: 2 3 3 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 2 3 0 1 -2 2 3 1  Output: -1 6    Explanation In the first case, the cross formed by the line segments {(0, 0), (2, 2)} and {(0, 2), (2, 0)} has the maximum strength = 1+(-1)+1+(-1)+(-1) = -1. Note: You cannot choose a cross with 0 strength (not passing through any of the given points) here, because it is given that each line segment of the cross should pass through atleast one of the given points In the second case, the cross formed by the line segments {(0, 0), (1, 1)} and {(0, 1), (1, 0)} has the maximum strength = 0+3+1+2 = 6 
The ISRO (Indian Space Research Organization) has recently built a supercomputer with the help of C-DAC (Center for Development of Advanced Computing), for processing data generated from MOM (Mars Orbiter Mission). Before using it for real data, they want to test it out with the following problem, as they feel it is very hard for a normal computer to solve this problem. Given a number N, find the sum of f(x) for all x such that 1 <= x <= N. f(x) is defined as the sum of all digits in base 10 representation of the number x. For example, f(121) = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4. As the number N is very big, it is given in the following run length encoded format - N is represented as a sequence of M blocks, where each block i (0 <= i < M) is represented by two integers - (len[i], d[i]). This implies that the digit d[i] occurs len[i] number of times. For example, {(2,1), (1,2), (2,9)} represents the number 11299. Can you help them by writing a solution to validate the supercomputer's output? Note: There will be no leading zeros in the given number.  Input The first line contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer M. Each of the following M lines contain 2 space separated integers, where the i^th line describes the i^th block with length len[i] and digit d[i] respectively.  Output For each test case, print the result modulo 1000000007 on a separate line.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 25 1 ≤ M ≤ 10000 d[0] > 0 0 ≤ d[i] ≤ 9 1 ≤ len[i] ≤ 10^18 1 ≤ Total length of N ≤ 10^18   Example Input: 2 1 1 5 2 1 1 1 0  Output: 15 46    Explanation For case 1, the N is 5 and the result is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15. For case 2, the N is 10 and the result is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + (1 + 0) = 46. 
Laxman is doing Diwali shopping. There are N shops numbered from 1 to N. Laxman wants to buy M different types of crackers. Crackers are numbered from 1 to M. Each shop sells many types of crackers. Laxman is currently at the i'th shop. Laxman want to find j and k, such that j <= i and k ≥ i and he can buy all M types of crackers only by visiting shops in the range of j to k. If there are multiple valid j, k, he then want to minimize the window size, that is, minimize the value of k - j. If there are still multiple valid j, k, then he wants to minimize the value of j. It is also known that, by visiting all the N shops, Laxman can surely buy all M types of crackers. Write a program to output j, k values for all valid i.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each test case is described as follows, First line of each test case has 2 integers, N and M. Following N lines describe the shops. Each of the N lines starts with an integer X, which denotes the number of different types of crackers sold in that shop. X integers follow describing the cracker types. All the X integers are different.  Output For each test case output N lines, One for each i, 1 <= i <= N. Each line should contain two integers, j and k.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10000 1 ≤ N ≤ 100000 1 ≤ M ≤ 100000 0 ≤ X ≤ 100000 1 ≤ Sum of N over all test cases ≤ 500000 1 ≤ Sum of M over all test cases ≤ 500000 1 ≤ Sum of X over all test cases ≤ 500000   Example Input: 2 3 3 1 1 1 2 1 3 3 3 1 1 2 2 3 1 1  Output: 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 2 1 2 2 3  Explanation Test case #1: Laxman needs to visit all 3 shops to but all M types  Test case #2: Laxman needs to visit shops 1, 2 to get all M types. Or he can visit shops 2, 3 to get all M types. For i = 2, we could have bought all types from shops 2 3, but we prefer 1 2 because 1 < 2, as stated in the statement we want to minimize j in case of tie.  
Ram has N different crackers. These crackers are very special, each of them can fire infinite number of fire-balls. Ram made an arrangement with those N crackers. If the spark is currently with the i'th cracker, it will first fire a fire-ball, and then it will pass the spark to the (i+1)'th cracker. Note that the N'th cracker will pass spark to the 1'st cracker. Ram initially placed the spark at the a'th cracker. However the spark will get exhausted after M passes, that is, it gets off during M+1'th pass. Ram want to know which cracker will fire the last fire-ball before spark goes off. Write a program to print this answer.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Following T lines describe the test cases, one per line. Each line contains 3 integers, N, a and M.  Output For each test case output one line, which contains the required answer.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 1000 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000 0 ≤ M ≤ 1000 1 ≤ a ≤ N   Example Input: 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 5 1 19  Output: 4 1 5  Explanation Test case #1: Spark is initially at the 1'st cracker. It fires a fire-ball and passes spark to the 2'nd cracker. The 2'nd cracker fires a fire-ball and passes the spark to the 3'rd cracker. The 3rd cracker fires a fire-ball and passes spark to the 4th cracker. The 4th cracker fires a fire-ball and passes the spark to the 5'th cracker, however, we already made 3 passes and this is 4th pass, so spark gets off. The last cracker to fire a fire-ball is the 4'th cracker.  Test case #2: Spark is initially at the 1'st cracker. It fires a fire-ball and passes spark to the 2'nd cracker. After the 4'th pass, the spark is with the 5'th cracker. The 5'th cracker fires a fire-ball and passes it to the 1'st cracker (Read the statement carefully, the N'th cracker passes spark to the 1'st cracker). The 1'st cracker fires the fire-ball and passes to the 2'nd cracker, spark gets exhausted during this pass. So the last cracker to fire was the 1'st.  
Sita went to buy some crackers. They offered special discount for the ones who solve a puzzle. Sita could not solve it, she came to you for help. Following is the puzzle. A mapping "a->b" means that you can transform letter 'a' to letter 'b'. You are given M such mappings. You are given two strings S and T. Write a program which determines if S can be transformed to T using the provided mappings. You can select any position in S and apply any of the M mappings on it. You can do this any number of times. Each mapping can be used any number of times.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer P denoting the number of test cases. First line of each test case has the string S. Second line of each test case has the string T Third line of each test case has M. Following M lines describes the mappings, one per line.  Output For each test case output one line, print "YES" if it is possible to transfrom S to T. print "NO" if not possible.  Constraints  1 ≤ P ≤ 1000 1 ≤ |S|, |T| ≤ 1000 0 ≤ M ≤ 1000 S and T contain lower case English alphabet only All mappings are from lower case English alphabet to lower case English alphabet Length of S and T need not be equal.   Example Input: 3 aa bb 1 a->b ab ba 2 a->b b->a a b 1 b->a Output: YES YES NO  Explanation Test case #1: Clearly 'a' can be transformed to 'b'. So "aa" can be transformed to "bb"  Test case #2: 'a' can be transformed to 'b' by using mapping 1. 'b' can be transformed to 'a' by using mapping 2 Test case #3: 'b' can be transformed to 'a' but 'a' cannot be transformed to 'b'. So it is not possible. 
Hanuman was the army chief in the war against ravana, he helped Ram. Well, everyone knew about that, but did you know that Hanuman also helped people of byteland? Let me tell you the story!! Long long ago, on the day of diwali, people were unhappy with the crackers they had. They wanted to do some swaps with others and get the crackers they like, but they had lot of fights due to lack of rules. They all went to lord Hanuman for help, Hanuman asked them to follow few rules for peace. Firstly, Hanuman did the following,  1) Hanuman, numbered all the people starting from 1. There are N people in all. 2) Lord also numbered the crackers in order starting from 1. There are N*5 crackers. 3) He gave each of them 3 crackers to start with. Person numbered i, got crackers (3*i)-2, (3*i)-1, 3*i. 4) Hanuman kept rest of the crackers with him.   Following are the rules given, 1) Each person gets his chance to ask for swap of crackers. This starts with person numbered 1, then 2, 3, 4 ... and ends with person numbered N. Any person, in his turn, can request for 3 swaps at the most. Note that they can also request for swap for crackers that are with Hanuman. 2) When a person asks for a swap, the other person should obey it and allow the swap.   Note that, after the process described above, each person will get 3 crackers. Having said that, Hanuman told the people to start the process. Let me also tell you about what the people prefer (In that order) 1) They always want their crackers numbered in order. (Example : 1, 2, 3 or 12,11,10 but not 10, 11, 13) 2) Each person has a preference number P[i], they want their least-numbered cracker to be ≥ P[i] and as least as possible. 3) If he could not get set of crackers satisfying condition 1 and 2, he will then try to get his least-numbered cracker to be as least as possible (Leaving about ≥ P[i] condition) Note:  No person will ever break 1st condition. He will always try and get 3 ordered crackers. After that, they will try to follow 2nd condition, and if that is not possible then they move to the 3rd condition.   All N people are smart. They all make optimal choice. They all also know that others will always make optimal choice. Every person also knows about every other persons preference number (P[ ]). Your task is to write a program, given N and P[ ], output the least-numbered cracker each person will end up with when everyone make optimal choice of swaps.   Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each test case is as follows, First line of each test case has one integer, N. Second line of each test case contains N integers representing the array P[ ]  Output For each test case output one line with N integers, i'th integer being the least-numbered cracker received by i'th person  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10000 1 ≤ N ≤ 100000 1 ≤ P[i] ≤ N*5 1 ≤ Sum of N over all test cases ≤ 500000   Example Input: 2 2 1 5 2 4 9  Output: 1 5 4 1  Explanation Test case #1: First person does not make any swaps. He is happy with the crackers he has (1, 2, 3). Second person swaps cracker-4 with cracker-7 to get the crackers (5, 6, 7). This is to follow 2nd condition.  Test case #2: First person makes 3 swaps (1<->4, 2<->5, 3<->6). At this moment, first person has (4, 5, 6) and the second person has (1, 2, 3) In this case, second person preference number is 9. But there are only 10 crackers, so he cannot get (9, 10, 11), it is impossible to follow condition 1 and 2, for that reason he decided to follow 1st and 3rd condition. Which means he want to minimize his least-numbered cracker. Second person will not request for any swaps as he already has (1, 2, 3)  
Ram brought home N identical crackers, and arranged them in a row. He then numbered all the crackers with positive integer numbers such that product of any two numbers is less than or equal to K. He also ensured that the numbers read from left most cracker to right most cracker are in non-decreasing order. Ravana took away all the crackers when Ram was not at home. To keep things simple, Cool dude Laxman brought N new identical crackers. Now he want to number them following the conditions Ram followed, but he realized that there are multiple ways to do it. Given N and K, write a program to output the number of ways to number the crackers. If there are infinite ways to do it, output "-1" instead.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Only line of each testcase contains two integer numbers N and K.  Output For each test case output one line. If the number of ways is infinite print "-1". If the number of ways is finite, print the required answer modulo 1000000007.  Constraints  1 ≤ T, N, K ≤ 100000   Example Input: 2 2 1 2 2 Output: 1 2  Explanation Test case #1: We need to number 2 crackers. And the product of any two numbers should not exceed 1. The only possible numbering is "1 1"  Test case #2: In this case the product of any two numbers should not exceed 2. Two possible ways are "1 1" and "1 2". Note that "2 1" is invalid because Ram ensured that the numbering from left to right is non-decreasing.  
 Like all other teams, the LaZyProblemSetters (consisting of V, J and S) are also participating in ICPC with high hopes for qualifying for the world finals. They would like to go to the world finals to represent their country and bring back a medal. However, first they have to clear the prelims contest. For that, they have decided to have a practice round before the prelims. They are going to have the practice round from time S to E. However, the team members are not so sure whether they would be able to participate in the practice contest for the whole duration as they already have some previous reservations. To solve that, they have created a list of all the things everyone is supposed to do or reservations they have to fulfil.  The list they prepared has a total of N tasks. They have also noted down the time in which each task needs to be done, i.e. the start time and the end time. During that time, at least one of the team members is busy doing that task and would be unavailable for the ICPC pre-prelims practice contest.   You are given the time slot LaZyProblemSetters have decided to practice together and the list of tasks with their start and end time that they prepared. Print whether they all would be able to practice together for the full duration of the contest. For this problem, you can assume that if V, J or S ends a task at time T1, he can give his undivided attention to the contest starting from T1 itself and if the contest ends at time T2, they can get back to their reserved tasks at T2 itself.   Input The first line of the input contains an integer T, the number of test cases in a file. Then T test cases follow each of which has the following structure: The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers S and E. The second line of each test case contains N. Then N lines follow each of which contains two space separated integers, xi and yi, the start and the end time of the i^th task.  Output For each test case, print "YES" (without quotes) if the team members can practice together for the full duration of the pre-prelims contest, print "NO" (without quotes) otherwise in a new line.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 3 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ S < E  ≤  10^18 1 ≤ xi < yi ≤  10^18   Example Input: 1 10 20 3 1 10 21 50 30 33  Output: YES   
As we all know that team LaZyProblemSetters with participants V, J and K is gearing up for ICPC 2015, and have decided to solve a problem set to practice for the prelims round. The day of that practice round has now arrived and they are very eager to get started. They have picked up an ordered set of N problems to solve. Now, since they are newbies in the field of programming, they have chosen problems which are not so tough. Hence, every problem that they have taken is solvable by all the three members.   To make it feel like the regional contest, they have decided to use only a single computer system.Since they are newbies, instead of optimizing on time and resources they have come up with the following plan to decide on how they would attempt to solve the problems.    They have divided their total time in N time slots.  In the i^th time slot, they will code up the i^th problem. Since they are easy problems, it is known that each problem would be solved within the given time slot.  In each time slot, the computer will be allotted to either V, J or K. They will not share the computer with anyone else in the time slot allocated to them.   Now all that is left is to decide who will solve which problem on the computer. To make things easier, all of them have listed their requirements on how the distribution of the problems should be.   K being a lover of the number k has decided that the total number of problems coded by him will be a multiple of k. J being a busy guy decided to never code problems in consecutive slots. In the gaps between his slots, he has some other work that he wants to finish. V being a relatively new coder, wants to code at least one problem from the whole set.   Your task is to find out the number of ways in which they can distribute the problems amongst themselves.   Input First line of the input will contain an integer T, the number of test cases to follow. Next T lines follow. Each line will represent a test case containing two space separated integers N and k.   Output For each input, print the number of ways in which V, J and K can distribute the problems amongst themselves in a new line. Since, it can be a very large number, output it modulo 10000007.  Constraints  0 ≤ k ≤ 10 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^18 The constraint on T can be computed from below.   Test Data Generation The value of T in an input file is determined by the following rule: For an input file, we keep an integer variable total (initialized to 0). For each test case in the input file, we take the value of k in the test case and update total as follows:    if k > 0, total = total + k  if k == 0, total = total + 1  Now, it is guaranteed that for each input file, the value of total as computed above will never exceed 500.   Example Input: 3 2 0 2 1 3 1  Output: 3 5 17 
 Finally the LazyProblemSetters have decided the way in which they will attempt the questions in the problem set. They have decided to go to the Computer Lab of the CSE department (because it has air-conditioning) and are ready to get their hands dirty with some WA's and TLE's.   Their department has a very unique lab. They have a lot of computers and each student gets a private account which they can access through any of those computers. For this, no data is stored on these computers but on dedicated servers and sent to the computer that a student is currently using. This way the students are not forced to sit on particular computers and can choose any place they like that is available.   Now, the department has a home built advanced facial recognition software which they use in this lab. It works as follows:When anyone sits on a computer, his/her picture is captured, (along with the locality) and sent to the internal database of the lab where they identify the user associated with that picture, and the computer he/she is sitting. After that the data of that user is fetched from the dedicated data servers and sent to the computer.   Now, all this takes time, and to keep the user busy, they decided to give them a puzzle to solve. If the user solves the puzzle correctly, they are allowed to login. The puzzle is as follows:    A string S (composed of only small case letters of the English alphabet) is shown on the screen to the user.  Then two integers P and Q are shown to the users.  The user has now to create a string R using S and P by concatenating P copies of S one after another. Then R is transformed into its smallest lexicographic permutation i.e. all the "a"'s are brought to the front and placed there, then after that all the "b"'s are placed, then "c"'s and so on. This is the final R that the user needs to form.  Then Q numbers appear on the screen one by one. For each number N that appears on the screen, the user has to type the character at the N^th location of R. If N is greater than the length of R, they have to type "-1" (without quotes).   Input The first line consists of an integer T, the number of test cases followed by the test cases themselves. Each test case begins with the string S in the first line, followed by two space-separated integers P and Q in the next line. Then Q lines follow, each containing an integer N.   Output For each test case, for each integer N, print in a new line the character at the N^th location of R  or print "-1" (without quotes) as described above.  Constraints   1 ≤ P ≤ 10^7  1 ≤ N ≤ 10^9  1 ≤ Q ≤ 10^5  1 ≤ |S| ≤ 100, where |S| denotes the length of the string.  1 ≤ T ≤ 10   Example  Input: 1 abcde 3 5 3 4 10 15 16  Output: a b d e -1  Note: Large I/O, be careful with certain languages 
As we all know that team LaZyProblemSetters is gearing up for ICPC 2015 and have finally reached in front of a computer together to solve a problem set. Since they have already wasted too much time procrastinating, they have decided to manage the problem set with more caution. They are now ordering the problems according to their difficulty levels instead of solving all the easy problems as they used to do earlier.   For this practice round, everybody has pitched in a few problems of their choice. So in the end, they have a set of N problems ordered as P1, ..., PN, where Pi denotes the i^th problem. For each problem that was brought in by any team member, he assigned an integer Di which according to him is the difficulty level of that problem.   The difficulty level assigned to a problem is exactly the number of time units one expects to solve that particular problem. However, as we all know, that assigning difficulty to a problem is really subjective and the assigned difficulty level of the problem may change when all the three team members look at that problem. Since, they are busy solving the problem, they have asked you to help in giving them the information they need about the problem set.  Following is the list of all of their requirements, for which they need your help:    Update the difficulty level of a problem.  Tell them the difficulty level of the most difficult problem in the problem set.  The total time it would take them to solve a set of problems.  Whether a list of consecutive problems are in some order of difficulty.  Px to Py are in increasing order of difficulty if Dx≤ Dx+1≤ ... ≤ Dy Px to Py are in decreasing order of difficulty if Dx≥ Dx+1≥ ... ≥ Dy    To make it easier, faster and accurate, they have decided to communicate with you as follows:    U x d The difficulty level of the problem Px has been updated to d. Hence Dx = d.  M x y What is the difficulty level of the most difficult problem in range Px, ..., Py.  S x y How much total time it would take them to solve all the problems in range Px, ..., Py.  I x y Whether the problems in range Px, ..., Py are in increasing order of difficulty. Print 1 if they are, 0 otherwise. D x y Whether the problems in range Px, ..., Py are in decreasing order of difficulty. Print 1 if they are, 0 otherwise.   Input First line will have two space separated integers N and M denoting the number of problems and the number of operations that you are asked to perform for the LaZyProblemSetters. Next line will have N space separated integers where the i^th integer denotes Di. Next M lines will each represent one of the five operations mentioned above in the form U x d or O x y where O is from the set {M,S,I,D}.   Output Print one line with the answer corresponding to each operation of the form O x y where O is from the set {M,S,I,D}.  Constraints   1  ≤  x  ≤  y ≤  N  ≤  10^5  1  ≤  M  ≤  5*10^5  1  ≤  Di, d ≤  10^9  O is a character from {M,S,I,D}   Example Input: 5 7 1 2 4 5 10 S 1 5 S 1 4 M 1 5 I 2 4 U 2 11 M 1 5 D 3 4  Output: 22 12 10 1 11 0  Note: Large I/O, be careful with certain languages

    Problem description. Abhishek is taking a girl from his office to a date but he lacks money. Unfortunately this is not the first time something like this has happened, and reason is obvious - Abhishek goes out on way too many dates. He makes up his mind to solve this problem just before the date starts and he starts planning for it. He wants a limit for the total expense on any date and tries to have the most possible fun with regard to this limit. Abhishek know beforehand the cost of each item on the menu and makes an estimate of how much his date would enjoy ordering each item. Write a program which finds the optimal set of menu items that offer the most enjoyment to Abhishek's date. Maximize their enjoyment, without crossing the budget. Needless to say but he wants to save money for other dates as well, so he wants to spend only the amount actually required and save as much as he can. Abhishek is lucky as he can always choose the menu items to order.  Input:  The first line of the input specifies your date budget and the number N of items on menu. The following N lines contain two numbers each. The first number indicates the cost of each item. Items cost between $5 and $25. The second number indicates the amount of enjoyment given by each item, given as an integer number ranging from 1 to 10(both inclusive). The budget will not exceed $500 and there will be at most 100 items. All numbers are separated by a single space. There are many test cases. Input ends with 0 0.   Output For each test case your program must output the total cost of all the items and the total enjoyment of an optimal solution. Both numbers must be separated by a single space.

The person sitting on first bench  has gameid 0, person sitting on second bench has gameid 1, third has gameid 2 and so on ... But they are not able to complete the game. So in order to complete the game they started using unfair means like using cheats. A lot of cheats are available to them. All the cheats are distributed into 3 folders named 1 , 2 , 3. It is found that when one cheat is being used then it is used by all people who have gameid between i to j  ( both i and j are included ). When the cheats are used then either the gamepoints of a person increases or decreases.  When the cheats of folder 1 are used by people having gameid between i to j then the gamepoints of person having gameid i increases by one, gamepoints of person having gameid i + 1 increases by two and gamepoints of person having gameid i + 2 increases by three and so on till j When the cheats of folder 2 are used by people having gameid between i to j then the gamepoints of all people in the  given range by certain value v. When the cheats of folder 3 are used by people having gameid between i to j then the gamepoints of all people in the  given range becomes v. A person comes  and starts to sum the gamepoints . But he was having great difficulty in calculating the sum  as N is very large so he decided to write a program which could help him but he was not able to write it. So you have to help that person by writing a code for him which would help  him .  THE INPUT WILL CONTAIN MANY OPERATIONS . BUT THE OPERATION WILL BE OF 4 TYPE ONLY  OPERATION 1 1 i j (this operation corresponds to cheats of folder 1)  OPERATION 2 2 i j v (this operation corresponds to cheats of folder 2)  OPERATION 3 3 i j v (this operation corresponds to cheats of folder 3)  OPERATION 4 4 i j (this operation corresponds to finding sum of gamepoints from i to j)  INTIALLY  GAMEPOINT OF EVERY PLAYER IS ZERO.

  It's not the rivers that you might be thinking about. The question revolves around the concept of digital rivers. A digital river is a sequence of numbers where the number following n is n plus the sum of its digits. FOR EXAMPLE  12345 is followed by 12360 since 1+2+3+4+5=15 and so   12345 + 15 gives 12360. similarly 145 is followed by 155.    If the unit's digit of a digital river is 'M' we will call it river 'M' .for example 231 would be called river 1.  river 480 is the sequence beginning {480,492,507,519....} river 483 is the sequence beginning   {483,498,519,....}.    normal streams and rivers can meet, and the same is true for digital rivers . This happens when two digital rivers share some of the same values. FOR EXAMPLE:  river 480 meets river 483 at 519. river 480 meets river 507 at 507 and never meets river 481.    Every digital river will eventually meet river 1,river 3 or river 9.   Write a program that can determine for a given integer n the value where river n first meets one of these three rivers.  Input   The input may contain multiple test cases. Each test case occupies a separate line and contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 16384). A test case with value of 0 for n terminates the input and this test case must not be processed.  Output  For each test case in the input first output the test case number(starting from 1)as shown in the sample output. Then on a separate line output the line "first meets river x at y".Here y is the lowest value where river n first meets river x (x= 1 or 3 or 9).If river n meets river x at y for more than one value of x,output the lowest value.print a blank line between two consecutive test cases.    Input:   86   12345   0    Output:   Case #1   first meets river 1 at 101    Case #2   first meets river 3 at 12423  
  Akash used to be a good student till class 12. In the last semester he was asked a simple question by our own MS. The question was not tough but not easy too. Given a number  N and a number M you need to calculate  N! % M. Akash thought it was too easy and so started smiling. Realising that it is too easy he gave akash some large values and promised to give him an O in the Lab exam. Help him get an O.    Input The first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.  Each test case contains two integers N and M separated by a space.     Output  For each test case, output a single line containing the value N!% M.     Constraints and Example Input: 4 5 7 13 19 20 483 35 2  Output: 1 16 126 0     Explanation Example case 1. 5!=(120)%7 is 1 
 Romeo wants to get some roses for Juliet and so he goes into a garden. The garden is in the shape of a H x W rectangle, where there are H rows and W columns. Each unit square of the garden has 1 to 100 flowers in it. Romeo has to grab as many flowers as possible, subject to the following restrictions: He starts by choosing any square in the first row, and collects the flowers on that square. Then, he moves to a square in the next row, collects the flowers, and so on until he reaches the last row. He can not go back to a previous row When he moves to the next row, he can only move to the square just below it or diagonally to the left or right. Help Romeo grab the maximum number of roses he can.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follow: The first line of each test case contains two integers H and W denoting the number of rows and columns respectively. H lines follow. Each line has W space separated integers A1, A2, ..., AW, where each integer M is the number of flowers in that square.  Output Output T lines, one for each test case. Each line should contain a single integer, which is the maximum possible number of flowers Romeo can get, for the corresponding test case.

 Romeo and Juliet are sending messages to each other. But to protect them from prying eyes, they have come up with a clever scheme to encrypt their messages. They have assigned a number to every possible combination of alphabets! It goes as follows: 1 = A 2 = B . . . 26 = Z 27 = AA 28 = AB . . . 702 = ZZ 703 = AAA and so on. Now you have to decrypt their message.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follow: Each test case contains a single integer N denoting the coded word.  Output For each test case, output a single string(upper case) which is the decoded word.

A surprisingly unbelievable unrealistic thing happened a day before Valentine’s Day. A lot of girls proposed Shubham and asked him out on a date. As this was the first time any such thing happened to him, he didn’t knew how to say no to any of them and end up saying yes to all. All the girls gave him time for the date on Valentine’s Day. But some of timing of the dates clashed with each other. Now Shubham is in big problem and cannot decide with whom he should go out with and with whom he should not. Saying no to a girl will break her heart and Shubham do not want to do that, but he also cannot go out with all girls. So he decided to go on dates so that he has to break heart of minimum no. of girls. Help Shubham in finding out the maximum no. of girls that he can go out with.  P.S. - The situation is completely hypothetical and not possible in reality.    Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of girls who proposed Shubham. The next N line contains two time S and E (starting time and ending time of the date in military time format) separated by a space.  Output For each test case output a single integer containing the maximum no. of girls that Shubham can go out with on a separate line.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 1000 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000 0 ≤ hour part of S,E ≤ 23 0 ≤ min part of S,E ≤ 59 S < E   Example Input: 2 5 0 220 530 715 945 1115 1315 1515 2030 2215 5 1630 1730 1700 1900 1800 2000 1930 2130 2100 2200   Output: 5 3  Explanation Case 1:  no date timing are clashing with each other, so the answer is 5. Case 2: He can go on 1st (1630 to 1730), 3rd (1800 to 2000) and 5th (2100 to 2200) date as they do not clash. So, the answer is 3. Note how the time is taken as input: 0 means 0000 220 means 0220 Do not place preceding zeros.  Problem Setter: Shubham Gupta 
  We all know that girls love gifts, right? Well, if you have been into programming, you must be knowing about Alice and Bob. Alice and Bob have been dating since a while and so it's very natural that they'll meet over a cup of coffee today, i.e. the Valentine's Day :D Bob is very confused as to what should he gift Alice today. He doesn't believe in giving expensive gifts (just like me :P), so he decides to give a custom selection of some fine dark chocolates which he plans to get gift wrapped along with a red rose. Sounds great!! :) A small problem has cropped up though. The problem is, when he visits the chocolate shop, the shopkeeper shows him many small dark chocolates placed in a M X N box. Bob is having a hard time figuring out the different types of chocolates available in the box because the shopkeeper doesn't have the exact information about their flavors. Though he can distinguish them on the basis of their shape, their flavors are not known to him because similarly shaped chocolates may have the same or different flavor. However, the shopkeeper does have some information in a weird format. He says that the chocolates which share an edge (which means they are adjacent to each other) have the same flavor. This implies that the box can have empty cells as well. Bob is curious as to how many different combinations of chocolates he can gift to Alice categorized on the basis of their flavors (and not shape)? Note: Two combinations are different from each other if there is at least one chocolate in one of the combinations which has a flavor which is not present in any of the chocolates in the other. See examples for better understanding.   Input The first line of the input consists of T, the no of test cases. The first line of each test case consists of two space separated integers M and N denoting the dimensions of the chocolate box. The next M lines consist of N characters denoting the contents of the cell: 'C' standing for a chocolate and 'E' standing for an an empty cell.    Output For each test case, output on a new line the total no of different combinations possible modulo 1000000007.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 1000 1 ≤ N, M ≤ 100     Example Input: 2 3 3 CEE ECE EEC 1 2 CC  Output: 7 1    Explanation Example case 1.There are three chocolates and all of these have different flavors. So, a total of 7 combinations are possible. Let the three chocolates be 1, 2 and 3 respectively.  Then the 7 combinations are (1), (2), (3), (1, 2), (1,3), (2, 3) and (1, 2, 3). Example case 2.Here both the chocolates have the same flavor. Hence, answer is 1 since only a single flavor is available. Problem Setter: Ayush Jaggi

Meanwhile their play they got tired and hence needed a break, Bheem  got hungry and we all know what he wants.... Yes you guessed it right, his all time favourite laddus. So, Chhutki offered him laddus, meanwhile Kalia noticed that the laddus where not spherical as they used to be but this time they were in the form of English alphabets. Kalia as we know is cunning got some idea to have those laddus from Bheem, and hence challenged Bheem for a game called “Game of Anagrams”. The challenge given to Bheem was to find all the different anagrams of the given laddus which we know are in the shape of English alphabets (A-Z and a-z) that can be generated with the help of the laddus taken k at a time. Assume all the laddus are of different shapes, help Bheem to win the Game of Anagrams.    Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.

  Recently Bheem and their friends studied well known fibonacci sequence in their school. Afibonacci sequence is generated by the recursive formula: F[n]=F[n-1]+F[n-2] where n>1 and F[0]=F[1]=1. Then Bheem started playing with similar type of sequences. In this process he came up with generalized tetranacci numbers.Generalized tetranacci numbers are defined by following recurrence relation: T[n] = a*T[n-1] + b*T[n-2] + c*T[n-3] + d*T[n-4] +e  (n>4) where  T[1], T[2], T[3] and T[4] can be any given integer.  Bheem tried to calculate the value of this sequence upto a given number n, but he was unable to calculate the value of n^th term instantly.Given the values of n, a, b, c, d, e, T[1], T[2], T[3] and T[4]. Help Bheem calculate the value of T[n]. As the answer can be very large, output the answer modulo 1000000007.  Note: The answer should always be a positive integer.     Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.

  Due to do his good deeds, Krishna asked Bheem for a wish. As we know our friend Bheem likes laddus very much so he wished that he wanted to be in a world full of tasty laddus. So, Krishna with his magic sent Bheem to a magical world full of laddus. In this magical world even laddus where magical. There Bheem found that enery that he can gain eating some of the laddus increases every day and those special laddus were placed in a N x M  rectangular grid, each cell E[i][j] (1 <= i <= N , 1 <= j <= M ) containing one special laddu eating which at d^th day gives enery equal to d * E[i][j] where E[i][j] is the enery of laddu in the cell (i,j) that can be gained by eating on day 1. Each day Bheem can only eat all laddus of leftmost column, rightmost column, topmost row or bottommost row of the grid. Help Bheem maximize the overall enery gained by eating the laddus if he starts eating them on day 1.    Input  First line of each test case contains two space separated integers N and M. Then N lines follows, each of which contains M space separated integers representing the initial eanery that can be gained by eating the laddus.     Output   For each test case output a single number denoting the maximum enery that can be gained by eating the laddus.      Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 50 1 ≤ N,M ≤ 32 1 ≤ E[i][j] ≤ 10^9     Example Input: 1 2 2 1 2 3 4 Output: 21   Explanation Example case 1. Initially the grid representing the laddus is : {{1,2},{3,4}}. Bheem will gain optimal energy, when he will eat the laddus in following order. On 1st day Bheem eats all laddus of 1st row (topmost row). Energy gained by Bheem on 1st day = 1+2 = 3 The resultant grid becomes {{3,4}}. On 2nd day Bheem eats all laddus of 1st column (leftmost column). Energy gained by Bheem on 2nd day = 2*3 = 6. The resultant grid becomes {{4}} (there is only 1 element). On 3rd day Bheem eats the only laddu. Energy gained by Bheem on 3rd day = 3*4 = 12. Therefore, the total energy gained by Bheem after eating all the laddus = 3 + 6 + 12 = 21.  
Chef Polo is experimenting with Prime Numbers. He can quickly tell whether a number is prime or not. His friend Palin knows about it, so he twists the question. Palin challenges his friend to check whether a number P is "almost prime" or not. The number P is said to be almost prime if it has exactly 3 distinct divisors. A number d is said to be divisor of P if P is divisible by d.  Chef Polo is quite intelligent but currently he is busy with preparing delicious dishes. So he wants your help.   Input First line Contains an integer T, the no of test cases. Each of next T lines contain a single integer P, the number Palin asks to check.   Output  For each test case, output a  string "YES" if the number P is almost prime. Otherwise output "NO"   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ P ≤ 10^12   Example Input: 4 2 4 7 10  Output: NO YES NO NO 
  There is a country which recently got invaded by a fleet of aliens. They started living with the people there. Relations between the aliens and humans were generally bitter. The government at the center decided that they will divide the country into 2 states (initially there were none). There are N citizens in the country; the aliens are denoted by -1, while the humans are denoted by 1. You are a Government official, who has been assigned the task to send the aliens to one state and the humans to the other. The citizens queue up at a place. The queue is denoted by an array, where each element is either 1 or -1 denoting humans and aliens, respectively. Bring the aliens to the left side of the queue and the humans to the right.    Input The first line of input contains T, the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains N, the number citizens, the next line consist of the elements of the array A.    Output For each test case output the sequence that is formed after arranging the aliens to the left side of the queue and the humans to the right.    Constraints Should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have. Format it like:  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ N ≤ 100     Example Input: 3 2 1 -1 4 -1 1 -1 -1 5 1 1 1 -1 -1  Output: -1 1 -1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1 1 1   
 The current year is 2210, and the humanity is in great danger. An alien race has discovered us and wants to cleanse this planet from our presence, so they can take all our natural resources to their planet. However, they are physically weak, so their plan consists in infecting one human with the T-virus, which is highly contagious but not deadly. If at any point of time, one person is at a distance not greater than R from a person infected with the T-virus, then he/she will be infected with the B-virus, which will kill him/her instantly.  The Terra Disease Control Center (TDCC) has discovered the aliens' plan, and they are determined to stop it. The first step is to create a simulation program that given the position of some static uninfected persons and the trajectory of a person infected with the T-virus, determines how many persons will be killed by the B-virus.  The trajectory followed by the infected person will be a polyline. A polyline is defined by M points Pi, and consists of the line segments between P1 and P2, P2 and P3, and so on. It is possible for a polyline to only have one point; in the simulator this will represent a static infected person.  Input  The first line contains an integer T, which species the number of test cases. Then, T test case descriptions will follow.  Each test case will start with a line with three positive integers, N, M and R, which specify the number of static uninfected persons, the number of points in the polyline that defines the movement of the infected person and the infection radius, respectively. The next N lines will contain two integers Xi and Yi, specifying the position of the uninfected person i. The next M lines will contain two integers Pxj and Pyj , specifying the point j that defines the trajectory of the infected person.  Output  For each input case you must print the string "Case #i: ", where i is the test case number, starting from 1, followed by the number of uninfected persons killed by the B-virus.  Example  Input: 2 4 1 4 2 2 1 5 -2 3 7 0 3 0 5 3 4 2 2 1 5 -2 3 -4 4 7 0 -3 0 3 0 0 3  Output: Case #1: 2 Case #2: 4   Constraints:   T will be between 1 and 200, inclusive. N will be between 1 and 100, inclusive. M will be between 1 and 100, inclusive. R will be between 1 and 1000, inclusive. Xi will be between -1000 and 1000, inclusive, for all i between 1 and N, inclusive. Yi will be between -1000 and 1000, inclusive, for all i between 1 and N, inclusive. Pxj will be between -1000 and 1000, inclusive, for all j between 1 and M, inclusive. Pyj will be between -1000 and 1000, inclusive, for all j between 1 and M, inclusive. No pair of points in each test case will be equal. 
Tanish loves alphabets. He loves alphabets so much that he ignores all other characters. Also, whenever he is given an alphabet he gives the next alphabet in alphabetical order in same case. For example, for a-b,for d-e,for z-a. Given a string guess what would be Tanish's answer.   Input  The first line of the input contains an integer N denoting the number of strings. N strings follow.   Output  For each string, output a single line containing Tanish's answer.   Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 20 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 100 where |s| is the length of the string.   Example Input: 4 nun123 1234 retA34 ^ 56az  Output: ovo  sfuB ba   Explanation Example For the second string, there is no output as there are no alphabets. 
 Today is Chota Mouse's birthday. He wants to celebrate it in a grand style. His brother Mota Chuha immediately contacted a nearby bakery for an online delivery of a cake. The cake is of rectangular shape with height H and width W. Chota Mouse has invited F of his friends to the party. So, he wants to make F vertical cuts at distinct positions on the cake, so that the cake will be divided into F + 1 non-zero area parts (F for his friends and one for himself).   Let us assume the cake is placed along the coordinate axis with its left end at x coordinate 0 and right end at W. Please see the image in the examples for details. He will make cuts at positions Pi such that Pi is strictly greater than zero and strictly less than W. Also note that, all the positions for cutting are distinct.   Chota Mouse is a nice guy. So, he will be keeping the piece with the least area for himself and leave the other pieces for his friends to enjoy. Chota Mouse is weak in mathematics, so can you please help him figure out the area of the piece he is going to have?  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. First line of each test case contains three space separated integers F, H, W. Second line of each test case contains F space separated integers, i-th of them denotes Pi. Output For each test case, print a single integer corresponding to the answer of the problem. Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ F ≤ 500 1 ≤ H ≤ 10000 F + 1 ≤ W ≤ 10000 1 ≤ Pi ≤ W - 1  Sample  Input  3 1 1 2 1 1 4 5 3 2 3 9 6 2  Output  1 8 6  Explanation In the first example, both the pieces have same area (i.e. = 1).   In the second example, there are two pieces. First piece has an area of 12, second has an area of 8. So, the answer will be 8.   In the third example, there are three pieces. First piece has an area of 6, second 12, and third 9. So, the answer will be 6.  
!doctype>   N cats and N mice are situated in a 2-D plane. Mota Chuha wants to choose K number of animals in such a way that the distance between any pair of chosen cat and chosen mouse is minimized. Distance between the same type of chosen animals doesn't matter. In other words, suppose Chota Chuha chooses cats C1,C2,C3,.....Cm and mice M1,M2,M3,.....Mn, then maximum of Distance(Ci,Mj) should be minimized. Input     The first line of the input contains pair of integers  N and K.      Next N lines will contain a pair of integers denoting the co-ordinates of the cats.      Next N lines will contain a pair of integers denoting the co-ordinates of the mice.  Output     Output the minimized distance. The output value must have an absolute or relative error smaller than 1e-6. Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 200 (N+1) ≤ K ≤ 2*N 0 ≤ X or Y-coordinates ≤ 10^5 No two animals are at the same position  Sample  Input 3 4 1 0 2 0 3 0 1 1 2 1 3 1  Output  1.41421356237  Explanation     Does't matter how you choose, A pair of cat and mouse will be at distance of square root of 2.   
!doctype>   Chota pendrive (one of the deadliest coders) is the right hand of Farzi coder. He is really fond of circles and squares. One day he saw this problem and solved it. But he is not very sure if he correctly solved it. Can you help him in verifying the answer.     The problem looks like:       There is a grid of size N x M, there are C unit radii circles with integer center coordinates ((x0,y0), (x1,y1) .... (xc-1, yc-1)) on the grid. Choose any square portion of that grid with side length A such that the sides of the square are parallel to the sides of grid, corners of this square must be inside or on the boundary of the grid and their coordinates are integers. Find the expected area covered by circles inside that square if you were to choose such a square randomly on the grid. Answer must be correct upto 6 places of decimal.  Input     First line will contain N, M, A, and C i.e number of rows, number of columns, side of the square and total number of cirlces respectively. Next C lines contains coordinates of center of circles. Output     One line containing expected area covered by circles correct upto 6 places of decimal. Constraints  1 ≤ N,M,C ≤ 100000 1 ≤ A ≤ min(N,M) 0 ≤ xi ≤ N 0 ≤ yi ≤ M No two pairs of xi,yi are same i.e. no two circles have the same center.  Sample  Input 1  1 1 1 1 0 0  Output 1  0.7853981634  Input 2  3 3 2 2 0 0 3 3  Output 2  0.3926990817  Explanation  Case 1: These is only one possible way to choose the square and it will cover one quadrant of a circle. Case 2: These are 4 possible ways to choose a square with side length 2 and two of them will contain one quadrant of a circle each.   
  COINS       Our Farzi Coder likes Mota Chuha a lot, as he runs very fast and catching him is not only hard, but also impossible.       The city is in the form of a tree (Graph Theory Tree), with N junctions with exactly one follower of Farzi Coder in each. There are N-1 bidirectional roads connecting these junctions such that there is exactly one distinct path between any pair of junctions.       Now Farzi Coder decides to distribute some of his illegal wealth among his followers so as to maintain their loyalty and wants Mota Chuha to do this task for him. In between the process of distribution, Farzi Coder would also ask Mota Chuha some questions, to check if he is really distributing the coins correctly or not.       Now for the next Q days, on each day, he assigns exactly one of the following two tasks to the Mota Chuha:  Give(X,Y,W) => Give one W rupee coin to all followers along the path in the tree between the followers X and Y (including X and Y). Find(Z, I, J, K) => Find the K'th smallest coin among all the coins present in the hands of follower Z which were distributed between I'th and J'th day (including I'th and J'th Days). If Z has less than K coins, then report -1. It is guaranteed that J will be less than the current day number.   Mota Chuha is too lazy to distribute the wealth. But he has to answer the Find() tasks. He knows that ICPC participants are very smart and can simulate the Update() tasks through a program and can answer the Find() tasks very fast. So please help him, he might give some of the coins to you.   		Note that a person can hold multiple coins of same value. Let us say, person Z has P coins with him which were distributed between I'th and J'th Days, i.e, Coin[1], Coin[2]...C[P]. Sort the array Coin[1...P]. Now, K'th smallest coin is Coin[K].   		Example: If person Z has coins {1, 2, 3, 3, 4}. Then, 2nd smallest coin is 2, 3rd smallest coin is 3, 4th smallest coin is 3, 5th smallest coin is 4.   Note:Number of Update tasks will be less 51% of the total tasks. The memory limit of the problem will be 1.5 GB.  Input  	The first line contains one integer N, size of the tree.   	Next N-1 lines contain two space separated integers "X Y" (without quotes) each, representing that there is an edge between the nodes (X, Y).   	Next line contains an integer Q.   	Next Q lines contains the tasks given to Mota Chuha. If the first integer in the line is 1, then it is followed by three integers space separated integers "X Y W" (without quotes) denoting the first type of task. Else if the first integer in the line is 2, then it is followed by 4 space separated integers "Z I J K" (without quotes) denoting the second type of task.  Output     For each task of type 2, output the required answer. Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 500000 1 ≤ X, Y, Z ≤ N 1 ≤ I ≤ J < Current Day Number 1 ≤ W ≤ 100000 1 ≤ Q ≤ 100000 1 ≤ K ≤ J - I + 1  Sample  Input  2 1 2 4 1 1 2 121 1 1 2 256 2 1 1 1 1 2 1 2 2 1  Output  121 256    
 Farzi Coder has been assigned an important coding assignment by his boss Programmer Bhai. Now, Farzi Coder has done coding his project and has to submit it to a central git repository.     In git, before committing we have to add the files which we want to commit to the stage. We can add (stage) or remove (unstage) files to/from the stage. Initially the stage is empty. Programmer Bhai is very particular about what goes into the repository and what doesn't. He has given a list of files alongwith whether he wants the file in the stage or not.     e.g.      stage /code/lib/acpp     stage /code/lib/bcpp     unstage /code/lib/aout      This means we want /code/lib/acpp and /code/lib/bcpp to be in the stage while /code/lib/aout should not be in the stage.     There are 2 git commands to control staging:     git add <path>     git remove <path>      The path here can be a path to a file or a path to a directory. If the path is to a directory, the command applies to all the files and subdirectories inside that directory recursively.  Farzi Coder wants to commit the code asap.     What is the minimum number of git commands needed to add all the required files to stage while making sure none of the unstage files are in the stage. Input     The first line of the input has the number T denoting the number of test cases.      The first line of each test case has the number N denoting the number of files in this case.      Each of the next N lines contains a word denoting whether the following file should be on the stage or not followed by the path to the file.      i.e. the 2 types of input will be stage <path> and unstage <path>. Output      For each test case, output the number of minimum git commands needed.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ N ≤ 100 The length of each path doesn't exceed 100 Each path is a valid path to a file. Each path input follows these rules:  It doesn't end with a forward slash (/) Each path starts from the root directory (/) There are no two consecutive forward slashes Each file or directory name consists only of lowercase alphabets All paths in a test case are distinct There will be no file - directory conflict. e.g. consider /a/b/c and /a/b. Here b is both a file and a directory.   Sample  Input 3 3 stage /code/lib/acpp stage /code/lib/bcpp unstage /code/lib/aout 2 unstage /code/lib/acpp unstage /code/lib/bcpp 3 stage /code/lib/acpp stage /code/lib/bcpp stage /code/lib/aout  Output 2 0 1  Explanation  Case 1: The following 2 commands are enough:     git add /     git remove /code/lib/aout         The first command adds the entire project to the stage while the second command removes aout from the stage as required.  Case 2: As initially there are no files in the stage, no commands are necassary.  Case 3: We add all the files to stage using git add / or git add /code/lib/ 
!doctype>       Our well known coding mafia went to the city. Farzi Coder is the boss here. He hired a new member named Lambu Keyboard in his gang. Farzi Coder is so smart (at least that's what he thinks), so he wants to test Lambu Keyboard's programming skills. He gave him this task:    There are n buildings (numbered from left to right) with heights H1, H2...Hn. You can start jumping from any building.      The rules of jumping are:    You can only jump to a building with lesser height than the height of the current building.  In first turn you can jump either way, and 2^nd jump will be in the opposite direction of previous jump and must end in between current index and previous index, i.e if we start jumping from building 5, initially we can jump in either direction. Let's say we jump to building 8, then in next jump we can only jump in left direction and only on buildings with indices 6, 7. Let's say we jump to building 6, then next time we can only jump in right direction and between 6 and 8 i.e to 7.        We need to find the maximum number of jumps he can make, considering every building as the starting point. Input   First line contains an integer n i.e. the number of buildings.     Second line contains n space separated integers denoting heights of buildings from 1 to n. Output   One line containing n integers, the i^th integer will denote the maximum possible number of jumps starting from i^th building. Constraints  1 ≤ n ≤ 5000 1 ≤ H1, H2 ... Hn ≤ 10000  Sample  Input 5 1 3 4 2 5  Output 0 1 1 1 2  Explanation   If starting building is with height 1 then you can't jump to any other building.   If starting building is with height 3 then you can jump either to building with height 2 on right or with height 1 on left. But there will be at most one jump.   If starting building is with height 5 then one possible optimal sequence is to jump to building with height 3 then to building with height 2. So maximum number of jumps is 2.   
 Farzi Coder wants to give a nice Christmas present to his brother. For that he has brought N pairs of letters where each letter is either 'a' or 'b'. So, the possible pairs are "aa", "ab", "ba" or "bb". Now, Farzi Coder's brother loves palindromes. So, he decided to concatenate some of the pairs (possibly all or none) and form a palindrome. He wants the longest such palindrome possible. If there are multiple such longest palindromes possible, he wants to give his brother the lexicographically smallest palindrome among them as the gift. Since he is, well, Farzi Coder, you have to help him build the gift. Input     The first line of the input has the number T denoting the number of test cases.      The first line of each test case has the number N denoting the number of pairs  in this case.      Each of the next N lines contain a pair of characters which are either aa, ab, ba or bb. Output     For each test case, output on a seperate line the gift that Farzi Coder has to build. Note that the empty string is a palindrome. Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 500 1 ≤ N ≤ 2000 Each pair can be either aa, ab, ba or bb   Sample  Input 2 4 aa aa bb bb 3 ab ba ab  Output aabbbbaa abba   Explanation  Case 1: The following palindromes are possible: "aa", "aaaa", "bb", "bbbb", "aabbaa", "bbaabb", "aabbbbaa", "bbaaaabb". Of these, "aabbbbaa" and "bbaaaabb" are of the maximum length. Among these two, "aabbbbaa" is the lexicographically smallest.  Case 2: The palindromes possible here are: "baab" and "abba".   
The Cricket World Cup 2015 is nearing and it will be held in Australia and New Zealand. The organizing committee is planning to give a welcome gift to each team member. After careful thought and planning, they have decided on Matryoshka dolls.  A Matryoshka doll refers to a set of wooden dolls of strictly decreasing size, placed one inside the other. Any doll can contain only one doll directly inside it. Given the sizes of N dolls, output "YES" if it is possible to nest them all and have one doll on the outside and "NO" otherwise. Input - The input starts with T denoting the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains N, which is the total number of dolls. The second line contains N space separated integers denoting the size of the dolls. Output -  Print “YES” if the dolls can be nested inside each other and “NO” otherwise. (quotes for clarity) Constraints - 1 <= T <= 100 1 <= N <= 100 1 <= doll size <= 1000 Sample Input -  3 3 3 1 1 2  1 2 4 10 2 5 3   Sample Output - NO YES YES Explanation - For the first case, there are 2 dolls of size 1 and hence cannot be nested inside each other. For the second case, the doll with size 1 can be put inside the doll with size 2. 
Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma are warming up for the World Cup at the Brisbane Cricket Ground, commonly known as "The Gabba". Their coach has asked them to go to the ground at the crack of dawn, and then jog around the stadium in laps. The Cricket Ground has poles spaced equally apart and numbered sequentially from 1 to N. The first M-1 poles lead up to the entrance of the stadium, and the poles numbered M, M+1, ... N are arranged circularly around the stadium, with pole M being next to pole N. Both players start running from pole 1. They always go from pole i to pole i+1, except when i = N, where they go from pole N to pole M.  Due to their different levels of fitness - something that their coach is quite upset about with Virat, that being another story - they have different running speeds P and Q, measured in poles/minute. They have been asked to run for ‘S’ minutes each. Since they can’t keep running for long, the coach has asked them to do short sprints of 1 minute each. First, Virat sprints and covers P poles in 1 minute and stops. Then Rohit sprints and covers Q poles in 1 minute and stops. Virat starts again, and they keep doing this for 2*S minutes (S minutes each). Virat and Rohit are considered to meet if they are at the same pole at the end of some  minute. Can you tell how many times they will meet during their jogging routine?   Input: The first line contains the number of test cases, T. This is followed by T lines, one for each test case. Each test case contains five integers - N, M, S, P and Q. Output: For each test case, output the answer on a new line. Constraints: 1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ M < N ≤ 500 1 ≤ S ≤ 100000 1 ≤ P,Q ≤ 500 P ≠ Q Sample Input: 2 4 1 4 2 3 5 3 10 1 2 Sample Output: 1 3 Explanation: For the first example, Kohli’s position at the end of his 1st, 2nd, 3rd & 4th minutes of run is {3, 1, 3, 1} respectively. While Rohit’s position at the end of his 1st, 2nd, 3rd & 4th minutes of run is {4, 3, 2, 1} respectively. Therefore, they meet exactly once after 8 minutes (their 4 minutes) at pole 1. For the second example, they would meet at the end of their 3rd (total 6th), 6th (total 12th) & 9th (total 18th) minute of run. 
Chota Pendrive likes to play with strings a lot. For a given string s, he obtains its compressed string in the following way:   In a single operation, he takes any two consecutive equal characters of s, and removes one of them.  He keeps doing this operation as long as possible.  The resulting string will be the compressed string of s. e.g. if the initial string is "abaaabb", its compressed form is "abab".   Two strings s and t are said to be similar if their compressed strings are equal.   You have to find the number of ordered pairs of similar strings (s, t) having length at least one and at most N. Both s, t contain lower case English alphabet. As the answer could be large, print it modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7).  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. Each test case contains a single integer N. Output For each test case, print a single integer corresponding to the answer of the problem. Constraints  1 ≤ T, N ≤ 5000  Sample  Input  2 1 2  Output  26 754  Explanation In the first example, s and t will be equal and will contain the same character. There are 26 possibilities for that from 'a' to 'z'.  In the second example, we can count the possible (s, t) similar pairs in the following way.   Case 1: s is same as t, there are 26 (each string contains 1 character) + 26 * 26 (each string contains 2 characters) possibilites for that. Case 2: s is of type aa and t is of type a, where a is some character. There are 26 possible cases for this. Case 3: s is of type a and t is of type aa, where a is some character. There are 26 possible cases for this.  So, in total, there are 26 + 26 * 26 + 26 + 26 = 754 ordered (s, t) pairs.

 Problem description. Ansh is very enthusiastic about his studies even at the age of 6 years. Recently he has studied about division and learnt to find quotient and remainder. After learning the division he became very happy and told Anshika about it. As Anshika is very smart, she decided to make fun of him. So she told him to solve a problem. The problem is as follows:- For given two numbers N and M, calculate N mod 1 + N mod 2 + N mod 3 + ……..+ N mod M; Here mod refers to the modulo operation. i.e. in A mod B we have to find the remainder after dividing A by B. Example: 5 mod 2 =1. As the answer may be very large print it modulo 10^9 +7. So save Ansh by helping him to find the answer as soon as possible.  Input Only line containing two numbers N and M.  Output Print a single integer corresponding to the given problem.  Constraints 1<=N, M<=10^13  Example Input: 3 4  Output: 4   Input: 2 2  Output: 0    Explanation  Example 1: 3 mod 1=0                  3 mod 2=1                  3 mod 3=0                  3 mod 4=3  Therefore, the required answer= 0+1+0+3=4  
 Problem description You will be given a zero-indexed array A. You need to rearrange its elements in such a way that the following conditions are satisfied:  A[i] ≤ A[i+1] if i is even. A[i] ≥ A[i+1] if i is odd.  In other words the following inequality should hold: A[0] ≤ A[1] ≥ A[2] ≤ A[3] ≥ A[4], and so on. Operations ≤ and ≥ should alter.  Input The first line contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains an integer N, that is the size of the array A.

Example case 2. A[0] ≤ A[1] is satisfied, 2 ≤ 10. A[1] ≥ A[2] is satisfied, 10 ≥ 5. Note: 5 10 2 is also valid answer.  
 For Turbo C++ Users : Read the following document before attempting the question :   Problem Description Hank Pym is an aspiring student at IIITD. He has almost completed his work on Ultron, the ultimate artificial intelligence. However, one thing remains. He feels that Ultron should have a fail-safe code which can be used to switch him off (just in case Ultron decides to wipe out our race). So, he encodes the number and feeds it into Ultron. Hank shares the number with the rest of the Avengers and the way to decrypt it:   Divide the encrypted number ‘N’ by its biggest prime divisor. Now, divide the resultant number by its biggest prime divisor and continue the process (i.e., recursively) until the resultant number doesn’t have any prime divisors. The decrypted code is the number of times you have to do this process.   Hank wants you to decrypt the number for him, so that he may store it somewhere safe (maybe inside one of the books at the IIITD library).Can you help Hank?  Input First line contains ‘T’, the number of test cases. Each test case is given on a new line, which consists of a number the encrypted number 'N'.  Output For each test case, print the decrypted number.  Constraints Should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have. Format it like:  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^9   Example Input: 4 2 9 100 17  Output: 1 2 4 1    Explanation  For the first test case, 2 has no prime divisors apart from itself. So, the answer is 1. For the second test case, 9 has 3 as the only prime divisor. Dividing it by 3, we get 3.Dividing 3 by itself, we get 1, which has no prime divisors. So, the answer is 2. For the third test case, the largest prime divisor is 5. Dividing, we get 20.The largest prime factor of 20 is 5. So, dividing by 5, we get 4. The largest prime factor of 4 is 2. Dividing, we get 2. Again dividing 2 by 2, we stop at 1.So, we did the division 4 times. Hence, the answer is 4. The fourth test case is similar to the first test case.  
 Gordon breathed heavily. "We can't take a chance. This is our only hope." Hiding under the shadow of Wayne Tower, he and Lucius Fox looked over the hordes of prisoners being released from Blackgate Penitentiary. They were arming up to attack downtown. "They need to cross the Riverwaith Bridge. Due to the damage we caused to it, they can only cross it in a single file. We must use this opportunity to cripple them." said Fox. "I have my undercover officers ready. They have already infiltrated the prisoners." "Hmm, we better give them instructions to position them in the file. I suggest we place the officers such that we keep the prisoners most separated. This will give us a strategic advantage when we strike." Input: First line: one number t , indicating number of test cases  t < 10^6 Next t lines: two space separated numbers indicating the number of prisoners (p) and the number of undercover cops (c). 0<=c<=p<=10^9 Output: A single number (for each test case) ,which tells us the minimum possible consecutive prisoners in the single file, after optimally placing the undercover cops. Sample Input: 3 15 4 15 15 15 0 Sample Output: 3 1 15   
    Batman likes everything customized for him (he's rich!). He has decided to put his mark (The Bat Symbol) on every gadget he gets from Mr Fox. Since gadgets vary in size, he decides to generate Bat Symbol in varying sizes which can later be printed and put on gadgets. Just when he was about to start writing the code for this, he saw the Bat Signal in the sky. Joker was creating some nuisance and Gotham needed Batman.He left to find Joker and has asked you to write this code for him. The Bat Symbol which has size defined by its height, though looks complex, can be broken into basic shapes as follows: View image here Input First line contains T (1<=T<=50), the no. of testcases.

Guru Prakash has recently discovered his sweet heart's (let's call her SH) secret affairs. He was amazed by the number of people one could have an affair with simultaneously. But after delving deeper into the issue he found out that SH has a pattern in her number of affairs she maintains at any point of time. Guru conjectures that at any point in time, the number of affairs SH has is always of the form "a power b"(suprising!). This conjecture is further strengthened by the fact that SH stalks a lot and is always bound to have lots of affairs. Your task is simple. You have to verify if Guru's conjecture is true. In other words, whenever Guru reports the current number of boyfriends SH is having, you have to report if its of the form a^b(both a,b ≥2)  Input Input description.  Every input contains a single integer n (2<=n<=10^16)   The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. Each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of boyfriends SH currently has an affair with.     Output Output description. For each test case, output a single line containing "YES" if its of the form a^b. "NO" otherwise. Quotes given for clarity. Note that a,b ≥2    Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10000 2 ≤ N ≤ 10^16     Example Input: 5 2 3 4 5 6  Output: NO NO YES NO NO     Explanation Example case 1. 2 is not of the form a^b Example case 3. 4 is of the form 2^2 
Arithmetic and geometric Progressions are 2 of the well known progressions in maths. Arithmetic progression (AP) is a set in which the difference between 2 numbers in constant. for eg, 1,3,5,7,9....In this series the difference between 2 numbers is 2.The task here is very simple indeed. You will be given the 3rd term , 3rd last term and the sum of the series. You need to print the length of the series & the series itself.    Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines will have 3 number '3rd term' ,'3rd Last term' and 'sum'.  3rd term  - is the 3rd term in the series 3rd Last term  - is the 3rd term from the end in the series sum - is the sum of the series.       Output For each input of the test case, you need to print 2 lines.  First line should have 1 value-number of terms in the series. 2nd line of the output should print the series numbers separated by single spaces.     Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 All numbers will be less than 10^16. The series will have at least 7 elements. In all the test cases all the series elements are positive integers.     Example Input: 1 3 8 55  Output: 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10   
Oh my God!!! Someone is trying to break into Thapar University's Database and steal sensitive research information. It is now up to us to stop this attack. Fortunately our defense mechanisms have traced the attacks to their source. The fastest way to stop the attacks is to disable the source. So all we need to do is to teach that guy a lesson, by planting a virus in his own system. But before we can do that, we need to break through all the layers of the security he has put around himself. Our sources tell us that the first layer is based on ASCII encryption. We must penetrate through this layer as fast as we can to reach the source...   Input:  The first line will consist of the total number of test cases T. The next T lines will consist of one string on each line.The length of the string should be greater than 2.   Output:  For each test case, output is a single character.    Example: Input:  3 abcd reverse gear    Output:  b m g   
We are very near to our goal now. The enemy is being weakened continuously. But alas, sensing his fall, the hacker has spread a worm into our network. It is consuming all our files at a tremendous rate and must be stopped at all costs. The only way to stop it is to enter a specific code number in to the worm. It is up to you to find an algorithm for the worm's stop code...Time is of the essence, my friend...   Input:  The first line will consist of the total number of test cases T. The next T lines will consist of number N on each line.   Output:  For each test case, output is a number.    Example: Input:  3 34 156 893    Output:  6 0 13   
Now that we have recovered all our data, we can return to hacking in to the hacker's system. Our sources tell us that this hacker's lust for power is so great that it is reflected in everything he does, everything he creates. Perhaps this knowledge can become his weakness in our hands, his thirst for power laying a trap for him. News also arrives of a great weapon being developed by him, soon to be unleashed upon us. Can you break through the next level of his security and disable the cyber weapon while there is still time?   Input:  The first line will consist of the total number of test cases T. The next T lines will consist of one string on each line.   Output:  For each test case, output is a number.    Example: Input:  3 aranya reverse gear    Output:  124 252 159   
At last, we have successfully neutralized all the cyber weapons of mass destruction, saved our university along the way and lay to waste another evil scheme in the process. All that separates that hacker from us now is his last lair of security, his ultimate firewall. It is imperative for us to break through this last line of defense and punish the one responsible for all this loss. Breaking this firewall shall be no easy task, but we aren't letting go either. Shift your gears in reverse and get cracking.   Input:  TThe first line will consist of the total number of test cases T. The next T lines will consist of number N on each line where 1 ≤ N ≤ 100.    Output: For each test case, output is a number.    Example: Input:  3 2 12 44    Output:  8 96 11264

  Problem description. An arithmetic progression(AP) is a sequence of numbers such that the difference of any two successive members of the sequence is a constant. For example:- 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, ... A geometric progression(GP) is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed non-zero contant. For examplee:- 1, 3, 9, 81, ... (with common ratio of 3). Given three successive members of a sequence, you need to determine the type of the progression and the next successive member.    Input  Each case is specified on a single line with three integers a1, a2, a3 are distinct. The last case is followed by a line with three zeros.  Output  For each test case, your program must print a single line of the form: XX v where XX is either AP or GP depending if the given progression is an Arithmetic or Geometric Progression. v is the next member of the given sequence. All input cases are guaranteed to be either an arithmetic or geometric progressions.  Constraints    Example Input: 4 7 10 2 6 18 0 0 0 Output: AP 13 GP 54

  Problem description Yalin has a little sister whom he loves very much. On her birthday, he decides to give her a special dictionary made up of words using just a few alphabets which appear in an odd order. Thinking she will love the gift as much as he did, he gifts it to her. But unfortunately, she doesn't like it at all. She wanted the book "The C Programming Language by Brian Kernighan & Dennis Ritchie". Angered by this, he throws away the dictionary and all the words fell off the book. His little sister starts crying and now demands to know which word appeared where.  Can you help Yalin calm his little sister down on her own birthday?  Note: The dictionary contained only 7 letters in the order - d, h, a, p, u, s, v  Input Format:- First line of the input contains the number of test cases T. T lines follow, each containing an integer. Each line contains the place N of the word Yalin's sister wants to know.  Output Format:- For every test case, print the word that comes at the Nth place.  Constraints:- 1 <= T <= 100 1 <= N <= 10^18  Example:-  Input:-  3  1  2  10  Output:-  d  h  da   
Chef's encounters with sweets continue with this problem! This time, he wants to distribute chocolates to his N students sitting on a long bench. The students are ordered according to the scores they got from the last exam. Chef wants to give more chocolates to the higher-scoring students. He also has a few more restrictions. Here are all the restrictions:  Every student must get at least one chocolate bar. If i < j, then the i^th student gets strictly fewer chocolate bars than the j^th student. The difference between the number of chocolate bars of any two adjacent students must be the same.  Chef has exactly C chocolate bars, and he doesn't want leftovers so every chocolate bar must be given to some student. Is it possible for Chef to finish this task?  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. Each test case consists of a single line containing two space separated integers N and C.  Output For each test case, output a single line containing either “Yes” or “No” (without quotes), denoting whether Chef can accomplish the task or not.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^9 1 ≤ C ≤ 10^18   Example Input: 2 4 24 2 2  Output: Yes No  Explanation Example case 1. In this case, Chef can accomplish the task by giving 3, 5, 7 and 9 chocolate bars to the students. Example case 2. There are 2 students. The first one must get at least 1 chocolate bar. The second one must get strictly more than that, so he/she must get at least 2 chocolate bars. Thus, Chef needs at least 3 chocolate bars. But he only has 2, so the task is impossible. 
Hermione Granger, the most talented witch of her generation, likes to solve various types of mathematical problems in the Arithmancy class. Today, the professor has given her the following task:  Find the number of fractions a/b such that-  1.	gcd(a, b) = 1 2.	0 < a/b < 1 3.	a * b = (n!) ^ (n!)  Where "n!" denotes the factorial of n and "^" denotes power, i.e. (2!) ^ (2!) = 4.  She is quite confident that she can solve it for n <= 10,000,000 (i.e. 10^7), but then she remembers that she has to study some case history so that she can help Hagrid to win the case of Buckbeak. So, she wants your help to solve the problem.   Input There will be one line for each test case containing the number n (1 <= n <= 10,000,000). Input will be terminated by EOF. There will be around 20,000 test cases.   Output For each case, print the number of fractions in a separate line. This number may be very large, so print the answer modulo 10,007.   Example  Input: 1 2  Output: 0 1 
 ACM International Collegiate     Programming Contest, Asia-Amritapuri Site, 2012 Gandalf vs the Balrog  'We fought far under the living earth, where time is not counted. Ever he clutched me, and ever I hewed him, till at last he fled into dark tunnels.     Ever up now we went, until we came to the Endless Stair. Out he sprang, and even as I came behind, he burst into new flame.     Those that looked up from afar thought that the mountain was crowned with storm.     Thunder they heard, and lightning, they said, smote upon Celebdil, and leaped back broken into tongues of fire.' - Gandalf, describing his fight against the Balrog.  Although Gandalf would not go into the details of his battle, they can be summarized into the following simplified form: both Gandalf and the Balrog have a set of N attacks they can use (spells, swords, brute-force strength etc.). These attacks are numbered from 1 to N in increasing order of Power. When each has chosen an attack, in general, the one with the higher power wins. However, there are a few ("M") anomalous pairs of attacks, in which the lesser-powered attack wins.  Initially, Gandalf picks an attack. Then the Balrog counters it with one of the remaining attacks. If the Balrog's counter does not defeat Gandalf's, then we say Gandalf receives a score of 2. If however it does, then Gandalf has exactly one more opportunity to pick an attack that will defeat the Balrog's. If he manages to defeat him now, his score will be 1, whereas if he is still unable to defeat him, his score will be 0.  Your task is to determine, given N and the M anomalous pairs of attacks, what will be Gandalf's score, given that both play optimally. Further, in case Gandalf gets a score of 2, you must also determine which attack he could have chosen as his first choice.  Note 1: The Balrog can choose only one attack, whereas Gandalf can choose upto two. Note 2: The relation A defeats B is not transitive within the attacks. For example, attack A can defeat attack B, attack B can defeat attack C, and attack C can defeat attack A. Note 3: Between any two attacks A and B, either attack A defeats attack B or attack B defeats attack A.  Input (STDIN):  The first line will consist of the integer T, the number of test-cases. Each test case begins with a single line containing two integers N and M. This is followed by M lines consisting of 2 integers each x and y, denoting that x and y are an anomalous pair.  Output (STDOUT):  For each test-case, output a single line either 2 A, if Gandalf can defeat any attack the Balrog chooses if he picks attack A, 1, if Gandalf can choose an attack such that even if the Balrog chooses an attack to defeat him, he can choose an attack to defeat the Balrog's chosen one, 0, if none of the above two options are possible for all possible choices of Gandalf's attack(s). Between successive test cases, there should not be any blank lines in the output.  Constraints:  1 <= T <= 15 3 <= N <= 1,000,000 0 <= M <= min(N(N-1)/2, 300,000) 1 <= x < y <= N for all the anomalous pairs (x,y) The sum of M over all test-cases will not exceed 300,000.  Sample Input:   2 3 0 3 1 1 3  Sample Output:   2 3 1  Notes/Explanation of Sample Input:  In the first case, attack 3 can beat both attacks 1 and 2. So Gandalf just chooses attack 3. In the second case, attack 1 beats 3 which beats 2 which beats 1. No matter which attack Gandalf chooses, the Balrog can pick the one which defeats his, but then he can pick the remaining attack and defeat the Balrog's. 
   Mr. Yagami is a scientist in the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre. They are   conducting a lab experiment on nuclear fission. In nuclear fission, one atom   breaks into more than one atom of the same type.    Initially, there are N atoms in the lab. Starting from now (t=0), after each   second, every atom will break into K atoms of the same type. They don’t want   the number of atoms to exceed M, so they have to stop the reaction at some   time t=T. Can you find this value T for Mr. Yagami.   Input Format:    First line contains P, the number of test cases. Next P lines contain three   integers each. These three integers represent the values of N, K and M   respectively.   Output Format:    For each test case print the time at which the reaction will have to be   stopped.   Constraints:     1 ≤ P ≤ 10^4   2 ≤ N, K, M ≤ 10^18    Sample Input:  2 2 2 7 2 2 8 Sample Output:  1 2 Explanation:    1st test case:   at t=1, number of atoms=4   at t=2, number of atoms will be 8.   So reaction has to be stopped at t=1.   2nd test case:   at t=1, number of atoms=4   at t=2, number of atoms will be 8.   at t=3, number of atoms will be 16.   Problem Setter: Lalit Kundu 
The aliens of Pandora have multiple avatars(incarnations). They can change from one avatar to another. But in doing so they suffer from varied amount of memory loss. Detailed study by alien scientists revealed that this memory loss is related to the extent of genetic variations between the avatars. Each of the avatar have a characteristic genetic makeup which comprises of 26 nucleotides denoted by a,b,c,...x,y,z(thus proving their superiority to humans which have just lesser number of nucleotides). The memory loss is inversely related to the length of the maximum continuous common portion of their genetic sequence before and after their transformation into the new avatar. Considering this task as a trivial one the alien scientists have decided to assign this work of finding the maximum continuous common portion of the genetic sequences to junior aliens. Help the junior aliens in solving the problem and thus befriend them.   Input The first line of the input contains a space separated two integers N and M denoting the lengths of the two genetic sequences. Each of the next two lines contain the genetic sequence of an avatar.    Output A number denoting the maximum continuous common portion of the genetic sequence of the two avatars so as to minimize the memory loss.   Test Data: The maximum size of the genetic sequence is 75.   Input: 15 20 qasfdthegdtghas hsydgetdgsfarsfthegt  Output: 4   
Godi and Abhik are two good friends. But then the day of Department elections came. They both knew that no one in the department is as jobless as they are to contest for the post of Secretary. They had specific set of skills with which they developed closed friends group for the past three years. People belonging to that group socialize with each other so they knew each other well. But when they both decided to go apart, the group split into two parts. And thereafter, no one from a group communicates with anyone from the opposite.   The department also has a set of students (say S) who don't mingle well with either of the groups. This is mainly because even though they like Godi or Abhik they don't want to mingle with everyone else in the respective groups. Godi and Abhik used their campaigning skills to attract as much crowd as possible from that set S. (They even supplied food to the student's door steps). Eshwar as greedy as always, thinks that if he pretends to support both Abhik and Godi, he can gain more. He has his own followers including Pradeep.   Subbu, the current secretary is tired of the cheap tricks played by the students belonging to the set S. He decides to conduct the elections as fairly as possible. So, he declares that "If and only if students belonging to the set S plan to support at-most one candidate, the elections can proceed". Obviously, he din't mean that all the students from the set S must support the same group. To check this, he prepares the list of connections between the students (by their ids). If a student is connected to a candidate (directly or indirectly) this implies he/she supports that candidate. But he later forgets the names of the students and just remembers the ids and the list of connections. So, he just checks whether he can construct a network where there is no one like Eshwar (who supports both the candidates) present in the final network. Some students like Spandana may be busy studying that they don't even know the elections are going on. Also there may be the case that no one is in the set S.  Subbu is perfectly fine with all these situations.  Now, Abhik and Godi are worried whether the elections will proceed or not. They seek your help, so that they can continue campaigning. Output "YES" if the elections will proceed, else print "NO".    Note that students from set S can support a candidate by connecting with at-least one of the students belonging to the closed group of that candidate(incl. the candidate itself). And also sometimes either Godi or Abhik or both can go missing from the list of connections. In that case we can assume that their closed group will also be missing. But it is not assured that they will have non-empty friends group if they are present. Hence, if either or both the candidates are missing then we can safely assume that elections can proceed(what a irony!)   Input Input description.  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers N, M. N denotes the number of students in the department and M denotes the number connections between them in the list prepared by Subbu. Then M lines follow. the ith line describes the ith connection. It contains two space separated integers u and v (u != v). u and v denotes the id of the students and they are 1-indexed.     Output Output description.  For each test case, output "YES" if elections can proceed else output "NO".(Quotes for clarity. Do not print them)     Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 20 2 ≤ N ≤ 500 1 ≤ M ≤ N*(N-1)/2     Example Input: 5 2 0  2 1 1 2  5 2 1 4 2 3  5 5 1 4 3 5 2 1 4 2 2 5  5 3 1 2 2 3 4 5  Output: YES YES YES NO YES    Explanation Example case 1. No one is connected. There can't be anyone like Eshwar planning to do the cheap trick.  Example case 2. Student 1 is connected to Student 2. Subbu can consider this a perfect network by assuming Student 1 as Abhik and Student 2 to be his friend. Or the same with Godi. He can also assume Student 1 is Abhik/Godi and Student 2 is from set S.   Warning  Input text files contains large I/O. Consider using faster I/O techniques.  
Number Mutations Given a number, we can form number mutations in the following ways     1. The digits of the number should be arranged in descending order    2. The digits of the number should be arranged in ascending order    3. The number obtained in (2) must be subtracted from the number obtained  in (1) to form a new number    4. Repeat these steps unless the new number has already appeared in a mutation  Note that 0 is a permitted digit. The length of the mutation is the number of distinct numbers in the mutation. The program should read the numbers as input and should output the length of that mutation for each number read as an input.   Input A sequence of positive numbers, all less than 10^9, each on its own line, terminated by 0, is the input. The input file contains at most 10 numbers.  Output The output consists of their lengths exactly in the format indicated below.  Example  Input: 123456789 1234 444 0   Output: 2 4 2   
vTechnical Festival Axis (TFA) is marketing a new computerized Yahtzee game Yahtzee is a widely popular and interesting game of skill and chance.

 Pranay went to the sea shore and saw what looked like a treasure chest floating. Examining the locking mechanism, he immediately realized he came across a set of puzzles in FreakoMatix-Axis'10 to reward those who are skilled in the mathematical arts and punish those who are not. There were six dials of the digits 0 through 9 in the puzzle accompanied by a message : "You will be given two positive integers lesser than or equal to a billion. You need to tell the final 6 digits of raising the first to the power of the second". Pranay was overstruck with grief. With such huge numbers, the multiplications could take ages, but he had no more than a few seconds to give the right answer.   Input Input will consist of multiple lines, each containing two integers A and B (1 ≤ A, B ≤ 1000000000), separated by a space. A line containing two zeros signals the end of input and should not be processed.  Output For each line of input, print out the correct dial settings, i.e. the final six digits of A^B.  Example  Input: 421 1988 628 496 0 0   Output: 362161 493696

  Yesterday was Anish's birthday. The most interesting gift was definitely the chessboard. Anish quickly learned the rules of chess and started to beat all his peers.    That day night Anish was reading a Book on puzzles and Enigma. He opened the book somewhere in the middle and read the following problem: "How many knights can be placed on a chessboard without threatening each other?" After a while he realized that this was trivial and moved on to the next problem: "How many bishops can be placed on a chessboard without threatening each other?". Anish is in trouble here. He is not able to solve this problem and needs your help.    Anish's chessboard has size N x N. A bishop can move to any distance in any of the four diagonal directions. A bishop threatens another bishop if it can move to the other bishop's position. Your task is to compute the maximum number of bishops that can be placed on a chessboard in such a way that no two bishops threaten each other.   Input   The input file consists of several lines. The line number i contains a single number N representing the size of the i-th chessboard. [N ≤ 10^100]   Output   The output file should contain the same number of lines as the input file. The i-th line should contain one number - the maximum number of bishops that can be placed on i-th chessboard without threatening each other.   Example   Input  2  Output  2

Problem Description Now that the votes have been casted, its time to count them. The ballot box has been locked with a secret code and has been handled to the Election Commission for counting. The ballot box is very secure. It has 5 digits on its lock and only a particular combination of the digits can unlock it. The digits on the lock can be changed only with the help of a laser machine. The laser machine is very unique. It has K keys (with a number on each key) on it. In each step, it multiplies the 5 digit number on the ballot box with any of its keys and then takes the remainder with 10^5 so as to make the number back to 5 digits. Note that numbers are have leading 0's in case it is less than 5 digits. But using the laser machine is very expensive. Each step costs C Rupees. So the election commission wants to know the minimum cost to unlock the ballot box. Given the initial code, the final code (which unlocks the box), the K Keys and the cost per operation C, your job is to help find the minimum cost to unlock the box, or report that the box cannot be opened.  Input The first line of the input consists of the number of cases (T). T test cases follows. Each test case begins with a line containing 4 numbers K C I F, where K is the number of Keys on the laser, C is the cost of using laser once, I is a 5 digit initial code and F is a 5 digit final code to unlock. Next line contains K numbers, keys[] which are the keys on the laser machine. Output For each test case, output a line with one number which is the minimum cost to open the box. If the box can never be opened output -1 instead. Constraints  T ≤ 50 1 ≤ K ≤ 10 1 ≤ C ≤ 10^7 I, F are 5 digit numbers and can have leading zero's. 0 ≤ Keys[] ≤ 10^5 Sample Cases  2 2 10 00002 00016 2 4 2 10 00002 00001 2 4 Output  20 -1 Explanations  In the first case, you can use the key with number 2 to first reach to 4 and then use key 4 to reach 16. So laser was used two times. In the second case, whatever you multiply, you will never be able to reach an odd number.  
   Problem description John and Dave are two close friends. One day John bluffs to Dave that in past some weeks he has learnt to program using any programming languages. Dave started laughing wildly on John but John insisted that he can really do programming. Then Dave decided to test John programming skills by giving him an easy program to develop. The question is to perform four operations on a given number. The four operations which needs to be performed are addition (+), subtraction (-), multiply (*) and division (/). The operation needs to be specified in a format. The format is “<operation to be performed><second number>” without double quotes. For example- if the user inputs “+5” (without double quotes) then 5 will be added to the given number. John searched the program on internet and easily found the solution and showed the same to Dave. But for a twist Dave said that there can be any no of whitespaces before the operation to be performed, between the operation and the second number and after the second number. For example- if the user inputs “   +    5    "(without double quotes) then also 5 will be added to the given number. When John tried to find a solution on Internet he failed. You (an experienced programmer) as a friend of John help him to solve this problem.    Input First line of input will be t, no of test cases. Each test case begins with a line containing an integer N (Number of operations) and the first Number on which the operations will be performed. The next ith line contain the operation to be performed along with the second number. After each operation the next operation will be performed on the result of the previous operation.   Output For each test case print the final number which will be the result of performing the last specified operations on the result of the previous specified operation with exactly 2 decimals of precision on a single line.  Constraints 0 < t < 100 0< N < 1000 First Number, the result of any intermediate operation and the final number will never exceed 1000000000   Example Input: 2 2 12 +5   *    2 2 2.13 + 0.2 / 2 Output: 34.00 1.17   Note Maintain 2 decimals of precision after every intermediate operation.

  In VSSUT, different departments are connected to each other except CSE-IT department, Workshop and Hydrolics lab. For this problem assume that VSSUT has N departments and some of them are connected to each other. Suppose you are in one of the departments and are trying to reach another one. But it suddenly started to rain. If your destination department happens to be  connected (directly or indirectly) to the department you are currently in, you can go there without getting wet. Otherwise you will get wet. (See explanation of test case for clarification). For simplicity, let us assume that the departments are numbered from 1 to  N. You are given which departments are connected, your present location and your destination. Your task is simple. Find whether or not you can reach your destination without getting wet..    Input The first line gives an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each test case starts with two numbers N and C denoting the number of departments and number of connected parts. Next C lines contain two integers a and b each denoting which departments are connected. Next line contains one number Q denoting number of queries. Each query contains two numbers s and d denoting your present location and your destination.  Output For each query print “Yes” if it is possible to reach destination without getting wet. Otherwise print “No”. (Quotes are for clarifications only)..  Constraints  1 <= T <= 10  1 < N <= 10^6  1 < Q <= 10^6  1 <= a,b,s,d <= N      Example Input:  1 7 5 1 2 1 5 1 4 2 4 6 7 5 1 4 2 3 6 7 7 4 5 4  Output:  Yes No Yes No Yes   Explanation :  First four queries are self-explainable. For fifth one, department 5 is connected to department 1 which is in turn connected to department 4. So you can travel from department 5 to 1 and then from 1 to 4.  
 The branch fest of the Department of Computer Science and Information Technology, SRUJAN, is coming soon. The coordinators of different events are working hard to make it a successful event. Some events are scheduled to be held at the auditorium. But due to some error, certain event's timing got overlapped. It means, some event are scheduled to start before another currently running event has ended. Due to this problem, the faculty in charge decided to remove certain events. He also wants to have as many events as possible in the auditorium. He now turns to you for help. You are given the number of events to be held and the starting and ending time of each event. You have to tell him the maximum events that can be allowed to use the auditorium.  Input The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each test case starts with a single number N, denoting the number of events scheduled. Next N lines contain two space separated integers each, denoting the starting and ending time of each event..  Output For each test case, print on a single line the maximum number of events we can have  Constraints  1 <= T <= 100  1 <= N <= 100  1 <= starting time, ending time <= 100   Example Input:  2 2 1 3 3 5 2 1 3 4 5 Output:  1 2 Explanation :  Explanation : In first case, first event ends at time unit 3, and second starts at 3. So both can not be given the auditorium. In second case, we can have both the events.

The end semester examinations have just been evaluated. The statisticians of the institute are not putting their brains to decide which class is the best of the college.  There are T classes in the college. Each class has exactly N students. The statisticians have decided that the best class is the one in which the difference between the maximum marks obtained and the minimum marks obtained is the least.  They have collected the data of each class. They now want you to calculate quickly the difference of maximum and minimum marks of each class.     Input The first line of input is T N separated by a space. Then T lines follows. Each line has exactly N integers denoting the marks obtained by the students of that class. All numbers are space separated.    Output For each class, output the difference between the maximum and the minimum marks.    Constraints T≤50 1≤N≤100 0 ≤ marks obtained by any student ≤100     Example Input: 2 5 2 4 5 1 3 0 100 90 80 70  Output: 4 100     Explanation Here there are 2 classes with 5 students each. Class 1. The maximum mark is 5 and the minimum is 1. Hence the difference is 5-1 =4. Class 2. The maximum mark is 100 and the minimum is 0. Hence the difference is 100-0 =100. Note: Do NOT ask for inputs by printing “Enter the value of N” etc. The judge is automated and will give you inputs automatically. Similarly, don’t write “The output is __”. Just print the result.

One day Alice visited Byteland to purchase jewels for her upcoming wedding anniversary. In Byteland, every Jewelry shop has their own discount methods to attract the customers. One discount method called Buy1-Get1 caught Alice's attention. That is, Alice buys one jewel, then she can get one additional jewel with the same color without charge by Buy1-Get1. Alice lists the needed jewels as a string S, each letter denotes one jewel, and the same letters denote the same colors of jewels, and the different letters denote the different colors of jewels. The cost of each jewel is 1. Your task is to calculate the minimum cost for getting all the jewels Alice listed.  Input The first line of input contains a single line T, which represents the number of test cases. Then T lines will follow, and each contains a string S, which represents the jewels Alice needed.  Output Output the minimum cost for each test case.  Constraints 1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ |S| ≤ 200, where |S| represents the length of the string S.  The string S is case sensitive, and will contain only English characters in the range [a-z], [A-Z].  Sample  Input: 4 ssss ssas sa s  Output: 2 3 2 1  Explanation In the first sample case, Alice needs 4 jewel of color s. One of the optimal way is the following: Buy the first s with cost 1, and she can get the second s without charge. Then buy the third s with cost 1, and she can get the last s without charge. In this case, she get 4 jewels with only cost 2. In the second sample case, Alice needs 3 jewels of color s and 1 jewel of color a. One of the optimal way is the following: Buy the second s with cost 1, and she can get the last s without charge. Then buy the a and the first s with cost 2. In this case, she get 4 jewels with only cost 3. In the third and fourth sample cases, she cannot save her money by using Buy1-Get1.

Suraj, a software engineer from Mumbai just got placed in a software company in New Delhi. As, he has to relocate from Mumbai to Delhi, he decided to buy a house. Yeah price of houses have decreased after Narendra Modi became PM of India. He decided to buy a house in a locality which has burger points at each corner. As the streets are only one way there is a heavy traffic jam and it take time to Suraj to reach burger point. Modi just declared that he will convert some streets connecting these burger points to two way roads. Some conversion cost is associated with each street. It will cost lot of money to convert all streets to two way streets so Modi  wanted these conversion in such a way that total cost of conversion is minimized keeping in mind that all burger points are connected with two way roads. Suraj after coming to know about this idea decided to buy a house in a two way street. But not all streets will be two way. So, he ask you to tell him if he should buy house in a particular street or not. As there can be more than one conversion plan, help Suraj to decide if he should buy house in that street or not. You will be given m queries by Suraj. Your task is to tell for how many queries will the answer be yes. Return ans in the form of a/b where a is the no. of queries for which ans is yes and b is total number of queries. (gcd(a,b) should be 1).  There will be n burger points and k streets joining them.  Input First line of input contain 1 integer t denoting no.of test cases. Next line of input will contain 2 positive integers n and k where n is the no.of burger points and k is the no.of streets connecting them.  Burger points are numbered 1 to n.

Every story that is put on his blog is mysterious and exciting. This time there is a twist, Sherlock Holmes has solved the mystery all on his own and refuses to tell Dr Watson who is the person that is guilty. Frustrated by this Watson posts all the clues and the events online. He expects someone intelligent enough to solve the case and let him know, how sherlock solved it. Although this information is not readily available and is in an encrypted form. He does so, so that all the people do not come to know that Watson is still puzzled, and out of the few who do he expects an answer…   The following was posted on his blog:   okius,uoeecjoenmwmro* nhtdhbpwnroonxhs.slu* eotdirajeerhatio'oot* slienenuibnnndsnwnct* nmnngadsgrecdad.hbkh* oegatklthorrpyohirhe* wsbshioibt.iahoecooi* ywynrnonohtmuorbhtln* naaoogktrehslltrohmc* isfwuieihreocmhofeei* giibgtdmosinreaktrsd* hnrah.oeorr,istehsqe* thelhhutdunmmgryesun* ,i.liotoknaasoeothet* ssacsltsiamrotauhos?* hhlawmhedreknadrrut** eolmieeesosc.n'weli** ruoenswtwuwrto?iedo** lsfcdgihhneihtcncsn** oearoonrodrmeerdrha** cssawtdewaesnoioieb**  The place where he used to write “The Game is On”, he wrote ”tas* hmo* een* gi**”. I can tell this as I have been reading his blogs regularly. Now it is upto you to figure out the rest of the message and help Dr. Watson. (Hint: Try writing the words in the encoded message one below the other. * does not have significant meaning like space or something.)   Being a technosavy person I expect that you will: 1) Figure out the algorithm. 2) Make a program to implement it. 3) Take the entire message and run your code on it. 4) Get the Final decrypted message. 5) Solve the case.  Ultimately, you have to write a code which will print your final word answer. If answer is "abc xyz utv" you have to print "Abc Xyz Utv". Do not print the quotes.

Do you like Treasure Hunts? I like treasure hunts. Love ‘em. And TROIKA 2013 has the best one ever in ‘MIST’ (apps.facebook.com/mist_troika). Just like a normal treasure hunt, you are given several clues and you have to get the right answer to progress to the next level and so on, until you reach the ultimate prize! But the organizers have learnt that a lot of users are not progressing even after figuring out the correct answer; it seems ‘someone’ forgot to code in ‘possible variants of the correct answer’ for each level. For example, if “Sachin Tendulkar” happened to be the answer to a particular level, “Tendulkar” or “tendulkar” or “sachin tendulkar” wasn’t accepted as correct. This is what you have to rectify. Given the expected answer ‘S’, your job is to modify the answer-verification-system to be able to allow acceptable variants of ‘S’. If the user enters an acceptable variant ,terminate the program. You can assume that the user is intelligent enough so that he will enter the answer in an order specified by the string S i.e he will not enter anything like “Tendulkar Sachin” if the answer is “Sachin Tendulkar” however he can enter “Tendulkar”.  Input The first line of the input contains a string S. The next few lines contain the input string P entered by the user.  Output For every line entered by the user output “Yes” if the string is acceptable and “No” if it is not. (quotes only for clarity).  Contraints 1 <= length of S and P <= 10000  Example  Input 1: Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar Sach Ram sAcH Tendul sach Tendulkar Sachin Ram Tendulkar SAChin TENduLkaR  Output 1: No No No No No Yes  Input 2: Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar Sach Ram sAcH Tendul sach Tendulkar Sachin Ram Tendulkar Ramesh TENduLkaR  Output 2: No No No No No Yes

 The Chef is having a dinner party and invited over all his friends.  His guests being fairly health conscious have exact protein requirements, and The Chef wishes to oblige them all.   The Chef will cook dishes for each individual guest using the ingredients in his kitchen.  Each ingredient has a specific amount of protein. The complete dish will have a protein content value equal to the sum of the protein contents of the individual ingredients. To cook a dish, The Chef can use any of the ingredients which appear on his shelf, but only in the order which they appear on the shelf.  The same ingredient may appear multiple times, and can also be used as many times as it appears.   There are multiple ways to choose ingredients following the rules given above. However, The Chef is only interested in choosing the set of ingredients that appear first in a lexicographically ordered list of ingredients which satisfy the protein constraints.  Your job is to write a program that helps The Chef figure out which dish to serve!   Input The first line of input contains t, the number of guests invited by The Chef (about 200).   Each test consists of three lines:  The first line consists of one integer 1 ≤ k ≤ 26 (the number of  unique  ingredients on the shelf) and than k space-separated positive integers from the set {1, 2, ... ,15} describing the protein content for each ingredient in an alphabetically sorted list of unique ingredients.  (the first protein value corresponds with ingredient a, the second corresponds with the protein value for ingredient b, and so on). The second line contains L - a sequence of lower-case letters of the Latin alphabet (at most 1000) which signify the name of the ingredient. The third line contains one positive integer S which specifies the exact protein requirement of this guest (1 < S < 500).   Output For each testcase either output the sequence of ingredients as described above, or the word 'IMPOSSIBLE' if no such subsequence exists.   Example  Input: 3 5 12 1 12 4 4 acccdadceb 2 3 5 4 6 abcbacbabcc 15 2 3 4 baba 7  Output: IMPOSSIBLE aaa ab   Comments: For the first guest we have five ingredients: a, b, c, d, e with protein values 12 1 12 4 4 respectively. To achieve a total protein value equal to 2 we need two ingredients b. But there is only one, thus the answer is IMPOSSIBLE. For the second guest we can achieve a total protein value of 15 with the ingredients taken as: abc, bca, acb, cab, cba, bac, or aaa. Of these, the first according to lexicographic order is aaa.  For the third guest, out of the two possibilities, ab is the correct answer. 
  Problem description.  The college has to give some gifts to the students on the occasion of the tech fest. But as college does not want to spend much money on it, it is intended to give gifts to as few students as possible. But it has to give gift to at least one student, it cannot give gift to none. But students has strong love for their friends and for a pair of students A and B, a student A will only accept gift if college also gives gift to student B but not vice versa. Each gift costs K rupees. There are N students in the college and there are M pair of friends in them. Find the minimum amount of money, college needs to spend to distribute the gifts.  Input The first line of input consists of three integers N, M, K as stated in the problem statement. In the next M lines, each line contains two distinct elements A and B as stated in the problem.  Output Print a single integer which is answer to the corresponding input.  Constraints 2<=N<=1000 1<=M<=100000 1<=A, B<=N  Example Input: 3 3 100 1 2 2 3 3 1 Output: 300  Input 4 2 50 1 2 2 3 Output 50    Explanation  In example 1, Student 1 will only accept gift if college gives gift to student 2 and for this it has to give gift to student 3 and student 3 will only accept gift if college gives gift to student 1. So college has to give gifts to all three students and cost of one gift is 100 rupees. So total cost is 300 rupees. 
Your friend Сhef has prepared a rectangular cake for you. Both of you want to divide the cake among yourselves. Your friend is generous enough to let you choose your share first. You have decided to take two pieces.For the first piece you make a rectangular cut (each side of this cut is parallel to the corresponding side of the cake) inside the cake. Now the cake have two pieces. You take the piece inside the rectangle cut. For the second piece, you make another rectangular cut (each side of this cut is parallel to the corresponding side of the cake) inside the cake. Now the cake again have two pieces. You take the piece inside the rectangle cut (note that this piece may not be rectangular, because of cut may cross an empty space that remains from the first piece, also it can be empty). Your friend will have the rest of the cake.Given the cuts determine the amount of cake that you will have. The amount is calculated as the sum of the areas covered by your pieces. The cake can be considered as a rectangle with the lower left corner at (0,0) and the upper right corner at (1001,1001).  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. Each test case consists of two lines.

It’s Halloween. Papa Smurf has received a lot of orders of candies. One day, while packing candies, he counted number of different ways he can pack candies in a box. Two ways are different if there exists a candy type for which its count in resulting boxes is different. Box has a property that they can contain only a fixed number of candies, neither less nor more. If Papa has three types for candies S1, S2, S3 and three boxes (B1, B2, B3), and he has to pack 6 candies in each box. Suppose he pack candies in a way that box has configuration B1{S1 = 1, S2 = 0, S3 = 5},  B2(S1 = 1, S2 S3 = 2) and B3(S1 = 1, S2 = 0, S3 = 5), then Box B1 and B2 are said to have different configuration, while Box B1 and B3 are same. But wait, there are some candies of which Smurfs are very fond of. So they gave you a list of such candies and the minimum number for each candy they want in their box. If a candy is not in this list, then Papa can pack any number (including zero) of this type of candy. Now help Papa in counting different number of ways he can pack candies in a box. Papa has infinite supply of each type of candies.  Input First line of input contain three integers, N M K, number of candies to be packed in a box, number of types of candies Papa had and length of candy's list which Smurfs give to him respectively. Then follow K lines. In each lines there are two integers, Si Xi, type of candy and minimum number of candy he has to put in each box (1 ≤ i ≤ M).  Output Find number of different ways Papa can pack candies in a box. As this number can be very large print answer modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7).  Constraints 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000000 1 ≤ M ≤ 1000000 0 ≤ K ≤ M 1 ≤ Si ≤ M 1 ≤ Xi ≤ 1000000  Example  Input #0: 4 2 1 1 2  Output #0: 3  Input #1: 5 3 2 1 2 2 1  Output #1: 6  Input #2: 5 1 1 3 6  Output #2: 0   Explanation Explanation for Sample Input #0: Papa has to pack 4 candies in a box, and he has two types of candies (S1, S2). This particular Smurf has mentioned that the box must have at least 2 candy of candy type #1. Then there are 3 number of ways of packing candies, represented by (S1 = 2, S2 = 2), (S1 = 3, S2 = 1), (S1 = 4, S2 = 0). Explanation for Sample Input #2: Papa has to pack 5 candies in a box, while according to list he has to pack at least 6 candies of candy type 3. And it is not possible. 
You have a set of unique numbers. You are trying to find a subset of this set such that no two numbers in the subset have a common digit. There will of course be several such subsets. You are interested in the subset with the maximum sum. The sum of a subset is defined as the sum of the numbers in the subset. In fact, you are most interested in the cardinality - that is, the number of elements - of the subset with the maximum sum. Of course there may be several such subsets with the same maximum sum. Find the cardinality of the subset with the most elements among such sets. Refer to the explanation section for more clarity.  Input There will be several test cases. Each test case is described in two lines. The first line contains the number N, the number of numbers in the set given to you. The second line contains N space separated positive integers, A1, A2 ..., AN. The input is terminated by EOF.  Output For each test case, output a single line. The line should contain a single integer which denotes the cardinality of the set that satisfies all the requirements in the problem statement.  Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 100 1 ≤ Ai ≤ 1000000000 No two Ai's will be same. There will be at most 100 test cases.   Sample Input  3 7 17 10 2 12 29 3 1 2 12   Sample Output  2 1 1   Explanation In the first test case, the maximum sum possible is 17. There are two ways to achieve that sum. {7, 10}, with a cardinality of 2. {17}, with a cardinality of 1. Hence, the answer is 2, since it is more. In the second test case, we can select only 1 number due to the constraint that the numbers in the subset should not share any digits. The answer is of course 1, for the subset {29}. Note that a subset of cardinality 2 is possible, {1, 2}. But, its sum is only 3. The sum of the subset {12} is 12, which is the maximum possible. Hence the answer is the cardinality of the set {12}, which is 1. 
Problem Statement Today we are going to play a very interesting game. In the game N balls will be thrown at you horizontally from one side of the arena one after the other. Each ball will be thrown at a specified height above the ground and since the arena is gravity free, the balls will reach you at the same height that they were thrown. You will be given a bucket to catch these incoming balls from across the game arena. The bucket will be initially placed on the ground (Height=0). In order to catch a ball you must bring your bucket to the height at which the ball is coming. However, the bucket has a special property. Once it has been raised to a particular height, it can either stay at the same height or move higher in order to catch subsequent balls, but not move lower. Now assuming that you play optimally, we want you to find the maximum number of balls that you can catch in a given game. Input Specification  The first line of input contains an integer T, the number of games to be played. Then T test cases follow each containing 2 lines. The first line contains an integer N which is the number of balls that will be thrown in each game. The next line contains an array  of n integers specifying the predefined height at which the balls will be thrown. Thus the 1st value is the height at which the 1s ball will be thrown, the 2nd value is the height of the second ball and so on.

This is a very simple problem. Given the value of N and K, you need to tell us the value of the binomial coefficient C(N,K). You may rest assured that K ≤ N and the maximum value of N is 1,000,000,000,000,000. Since the value may be very large, you need to compute the result modulo 1009.  Input The first line of the input contains the number of test cases T, at most 1000. Each of the next T lines consists of two space separated integers N and K, where 0 ≤ K ≤ N and 1 ≤ N ≤ 1,000,000,000,000,000.  Output For each test case, print on a new line, the value of the binomial coefficient C(N,K) modulo 1009.   Example  Input: 3 3 1 5 2 10 3 Output: 3 10 120

 ACM International Collegiate     Programming Contest, Asia-Amritapuri Site, 2012 Saruman of Many Colours  '"For I am Saruman the Wise, Saruman Ring-maker, Saruman of Many Colours!"     'I looked then and saw that his robes, which had seemed white, were not so, but were woven of all colours.     And if he moved they shimmered and changed hue so that the eye was bewildered.' - Gandalf the Grey.  And so it was that Saruman decided to brand his Uruk-hai army with the many colours that he fancied. His method of branding his army was as follows. He straps his army of N Uruk-hai onto chairs on a conveyor belt. This conveyor belt passes through his colouring-room, and can be moved forward or backward. The Uruk-hai are numbered 0 to N-1 according to the order in which they are seated. Saruman wishes that the i'th Uruk-hai be coloured with the colour c[i]. Further, his colouring-room has space for exactly K chairs. Once the chosen K consecutive Uruk-hai are put into the room, a colour jet sprays all K of them with any fixed colour. The conveyor belt is not circular (which means that the N-1'th and the 0'th Uruk-hai are not consecutive). Note that Uruk-hai can be recoloured in this process.  Saruman wants to find out what is the minimum number of times that the jet needs to be used in order to colour his army in the required fashion. If it is not possible to colour the army in the required fashion, output -1.  Input (STDIN):  The first line contains the number of test-cases T. Each test case consists of 2 lines. The first line contains two space-separated integers, N and K. This is followed by a single line containing a string c of length N, describing the colours of the army. The i'th character of c denotes the colour of the i'th Uruk-hai in the army.  Output (STDOUT):  Output T lines, one for each test case containing the answer for the corresponding test case. Remember if it is not possible to colour the army as required, output -1.  Constraints:  1 <= T <= 50 1 <= K <= N <= 20,000 The string c has length exactly N and contains only the characters 'a',...,'z'.  Sample Input:   2 3 2 rgg 3 3 rgg  Sample Output:   2 -1  Notes/Explanation of Sample Input:  In the first test case, soldiers 0 and 1 can first be painted with 'r', and then soldiers 1 and 2 can be painted with 'g'. In the second test case, since N = K, all the soldiers will only have the same color.

In DDU's annual techno-cultural fest – Felicific, the Computer Engineering department is introducing a weird contest this time. In the contest, there are N registered participants, with heights h[1..N]. A coordinator speaks out a number K to all of them. The prize is awarded to any pair of participants whose heights add up to exactly K. The participants may form pairs however they like. Now, since you are to conduct this event and every event works with limited budgets, you need to find out whether, given the heights h[1..N] and the number K, is it possible for a pair to win? Assume that if there is such a pair, they will eventually find each other and claim the prize.  Note that exactly 2 participants are needed to claim the prize. A participant cannot choose himself as a partner, nor can more than 2 participants claim the prize if their heights add up to K  Input The first line contains 2 integers N and K denoting the number of registered participants and the required sum respectively. In the next line, there are exactly N integers denoting the heights of each participant.  Output Print "Yes" if such a pair exists, otherwise print "No" (without quotes).  Constraints  2 ≤ N ≤ 1000 0 ≤ K ≤ 2 * 10^18 0 ≤ h[i] ≤ 10^18   Example  Input 6 6 2 9 5 2 2 1  Output Yes   Explanation The pair (5, 1) can claim the prize.  
Somewhere out there, there are N islands numbered from 1 to N with no network connectivity. Communication is such a pain for the islands' dwellers. So the Kings of the islands go to nearby islands and decide to connect the islands with underwater cables for bidirectional communication. Initially no islands are connected with cables. You are required to process Q queries of the form:  t x y  where t denotes the type of query and can be 0 or 1. If t is 0, it denotes that a new cable is installed between islands x and y. When t is 1, you need to answer whether communication is possible between islands x and y. Two islands can communicate if a route can be established with the cables, i.e., the islands are directly or indirectly connected with cables.  Input The first line contains 2 integers N and Q denoting the number of islands and number of queries respectively. In the next Q lines, each line has a query of the form "t x y".  Output For each query of type 1, on separate lines print "Yes" if communication is possible or "No" otherwise (without quotes).  Constraints  2 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ Q ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ x, y ≤ N For each test case, x ≠ y   Example  Input 5 7 0 1 2 1 2 1 0 3 4 1 1 4 0 3 2 1 2 3 1 1 4  Output Yes No Yes Yes   Explanation Initially no islands are connected.  Join 1-2. Since 1 and 2 are connected, communication is possible. Join 3-4. Currently, 1-2 and 3-4 are the only cables. So no path from 1-4 is available. Join 2-3. So the connected islands are 1-2-3-4. Communication is possible between 2 and 3. Communication is possible between 1 and 4, due to the cables 1-2-3-4.

 Today its going to be the Big Byteland FundRaiser Event. Many people who are to raise funds for their cause will be coming to this event. Carol has been having some financial issues with her NGO. Today she’ll have to convince some of the donors to donate for her NGO. As she has good links with the organisers, she managed to gather a description of the fixed donors disposition on the room (which is represented as an N × N square matrix), such that she knows in advance the amount each person will donate. She also knows that the room is divided into several parallel corridors, such that we will denote the j-th cell on corridor i, as [i][j].  Note that some donors can donate Carol, zero money or negative money(taking back what they consented to give already), as they may change their minds. There is just one donor at each cell of the matrix, except the cells [1][1] and [N][N]. To complete her fundraising, she must start on the top leftmost corner of the room (cell [1][1]), and finish on the bottom right corner (cell [N][N]), moving either to the cell directly in front of her on the same corridor (that is, moving from cell [r][c] to cell [r][c+1], where c+1 <= N) or to the cell in the next corridor directly in front of where she is (that is, moving from cell [r][c] to cell [r+1][c], where r+1 <= N). She will keep doing this until she reaches the end point of the room, i.e. last cell [N][N] on the last corridor. Carol will convince all visited cells with a donor. Carol wants to maximize her average donation at end. More specifically, if she passes K donors, each being on cell [i1][j1],  cell [i2][j2], ..., cell [iK][jK] respectively, then she wants to maximize (S[i1][j1] + S[i2][j2] + ... + S[iK][jK]) / K, where S[i][j] denotes the amount that the donor will give her on the cell [i][j]. Help her determine the best path she has to follow in order to maximize the average donations.   Input   The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.   The  first  line  contains  a  single  integer N denoting the number of size of matrix.  Each  of  the  next  N  lines  contains  N  space-separated  integers.   Note : The j-th integer S[i][j] in i-th line denotes the donation donated by the donor at cell [i][j]. Note that the cells [1][1] and [N][N] have no donors, so S[1][1] and S[N][N] will be 0.     Output For each test case, if the maximum possible average funds  Carol can obtain is negative, output a single line containing "No funds" (quotes for clarity). Otherwise, output the maximum possible average funds. The answer will be considered correct if it has an absolute error no more than 10^-6.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤  50 2 ≤ N ≤  100 -1000 ≤ S[i][j] ≤  1000 S[1][1] = S[N][N] =  0     Example Input: 2 2 0 -4 3 0 2 0 -4 -3  0  Output: 3.000000 No funds   
 Bob has given Scoop and Muck their new task. As of now, they are at House number X and Y. They have to fix some houses hi (X<=hi<=Y) in a straight lane. Things can be strange in their world. Only those houses have a problem and need to be fixed whose number is a N-Prime-divisors. A number is N-Prime-divisors if it has exactly N distinct prime divisors. For example number 4 is 1-Prime-divisors-number, number 42 is 3-Prime-divisors-number. So Scoop and Muck start from their places and move towards each other fixing all houses that are N-Prime-divisors. By time they meet, how many houses they have fixed in total(inclusive of the house where they meet)? Note :  A prime number is 1-Prime-Divisor because it is divisible by itself.

 Huge population has been a major problem in India. To reduce the population growth, Pratyush was asked to come up with a plan. Pratyush, being an intelligent as he is, came up with the following plan: A man with name M is allowed to marry a woman with name W, only if M is anagram of W or W is anagram of M. One name is an anagram of another if the second is simply a rearrangement of the first. For example, 'heart' and 'earth' are anagrams. Your task is to determine whether a couple is allowed to marry or not, according to Pratyush's rule.   Input   The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows :  Each test case contains two space separated strings M and W.    Output For each test case print "YES" if they are allowed to marry, else print "NO".

  Alan plans a heist to rob a bank. The bank has  N vaults containing money .Each vault is numbered from 1 to N. The ith vault of the bank contains rupees i. All the vaults are initially closed. But since the bank contains so much money, it has routine security checks in the following manner:    N security guards enter the bank.                                                                                                 The first security guard opens all the vaults.                                                                                    The second security guard closes every second vault.                                                                                       The third security guard opens every third vault.                                                                                In this manner, the ith security guard reverses the state(open or closed) of every ith vault in the bank. Alan enters the bank after all N security guards have finished their routine check. He can only rob all the open vaults. But before he commits the robbery, Alan decides to calculate the total amount of money he can rob. But since Alan is weak in mathematics, he asks you for help. Your task is to calculate the total amount of money Alan can rob from the bank.  (It is obvious that Alan can only steal money from all the OPEN vaults.)   Input The first line of input will contain an integer T which denotes the number of test cases. The next T lines will each have a positive whole number number N, denoting the number of vaults in the bank and also the Number of Guards that will be doing the routine check.   Output For each test case, Output a single line containing the total amount of money Alan can rob from the bank.  Constraints :  1 ≤ N ≤ 1000 (30 Points) 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^12(40 Points) (Easier Test Cases) 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^12(30 Points)     Example Input: 235  Output: 15    Explanation In the first case, there are 3 vaults. The vault which is open after 3 guards  do the routine check is only Vault Number 1. Hence Amount which can be stolen is 1. In the second case, There are 5 vaults. After 5 security guards enter, the open vaults are number 1 and number 4. Since the ith vault has i rupees, the amount which can be stolen is 1+4=5.  TIPS The input and output format is to be Strictly Followed.Each output will consist of a single line containing the required sum. Errors in inputting or outputting the numbers in the required format will make a correct solution give a Wrong Answer also! 
  As we all know, a substring is a contiguous subsequence of characters of a word. For example, the substrings of the word cat would be c,a,t,ca,at,cat. Given a String  S composed of only lower case characters, and a substring  X  also of lower case characters, your job is to remove all occurrences of X from S .    For example, if the String is “banana” and the substring is an, the resulting String would be “ba”.                                                                                                       If the resulting String has zero length, print “0” (without quotes).     Input The first Line of Input will contain an Integer T, Denoting the number of Test Cases. The next 2T  Lines will contain two Strings  S and X, alternatively.  Output For each test case, print the resulting String on a new line.  Constraints Should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have. Format it like:  1 ≤ |S| ≤ 15 (30 Points) 1 ≤ |S| ≤ 1000 (70 Points) 1 ≤ |X| ≤ |S|     Example Input: 2bananaanlolwutlolwutlolwutlol Output: bawutwutwut    Explanation Removing all occurrences of ‘an’ from ‘banana’ results in ‘ba’.     Similarly, removing all occurrences of ‘lol’ from ‘lolwutlolwutlolwut’ results in ‘wutwutwut’.  The Input and Output Format are to be followed STRICTLY. It is advised to use BufferedReader for this problem.  
There are n children who have landed up in an unknown place where they find just some jar of cookies to eat. They also have a dog with them. The children gather all the cookies and put them in a big jar. Exhausted, they agree to go and wait until the next morning to divide up the cookies. At one o'clock in the morning, the first child wakes up. He realizes that he can't trust the others, and decides to take his share now. He divides the cookies into n equal shares, but there is one left over. He gives that cookie to the dog, hides his cookies, and puts the rest of the cookies back. At two o'clock, the second child wakes up. Not realizing that the first child has already taken his share, he too divides the cookies up into n shares, leaving one over which he gives to the dog. He then hides his share, and puts the remainder back. At three, four, five…… ‘n’ o'clock in the morning, the third, fourth, fifth …….nth children each wake up and carry out the same actions. In the morning, all the children wake up, and try to look innocent. No one makes a remark about the diminished share of cookies, and no one decides to be honest and admit that they've already taken their share. Instead, they divide the share up into nshares, for the (n+1)th time, and find that there is yet again one cookie left over, which they give to the dog. You have to find out how many cookies were present originally in the jar.  Input  The input will contain several numbers of test cases. The first line will contain the number of test cases(x) followed by ‘x’ lines of inputs which contains the values of ‘n’.  Output  For each input print the number of cookies present in the jar.   Example  Input: 2 5 6   Output: 15621 279931

You are given two non-negative integers X and Y, you have to calculate the sum  (F(X) + F(X + 1) + ... + F(Y)) mod 1000000007, where F(N)=F(N-1)+F(N-2),N ≥ 2.     Input The first line contains an integer T (the number of test cases). Then, T lines follow. Each test case consists of a single line with two non-negative integers X and Y.    Output For each test case you have to output a single line containing the answer. Since the answer can be huge i.e go out of the bounds of integers, You are required to print the answer MOD 10^9+7    Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 1000 0 ≤ X ≤ Y ≤ 1000     Example Input: 3 2 6 3 5 10 19 170 725 Output: 19 10 10857 901453553  Explanation The fibonacci series goes like this 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21,.... For the first test case, we need to calculate the sum of the Fibonacci series from its 2nd term till 6th. ( i.e 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 ) = 19%(10^9+7) == 19 NOTE:  Use long int or long long int for data storage to avoid overflow.  HINT:  From the 100th term onward, the fibonacci numbers become too large to be stored in any integer in C or C++.  GIVEAWAY:  ( a + b + c + ...)%m = ( a%m + b%m +c%m + ....)%m    
 Virat is a guy who likes solving problems very much. Today Virat’s friend Jadega gave him a problem to solve. Jadeja gives Virat three numbers: N, L and R and Virat has to find out the count of numbers between L and R (both inclusive) which are divisible by at least 1 prime number belonging to range 1 to N (inclusive). Though Virat likes to solve problems, this one seems too hard for him to solve. So he turns to you in order to solve the problem. Now it is your job to solve this problem for Virat.  Input  First line of input contains number of test cases T. Each of next T lines contain 3 space separated integers:  N,L and R as described in the problem statement.   Output  For each test case, print a single line having the count of numbers between L and R (both inclusive) which are divisible by at least 1 prime number belonging to range 1 to N (inclusive).   Constraints  1 ≤ T   ≤ 10 2 ≤ N ≤ 50 1 ≤ L ≤  R ≤ 10^18   Example Input 2 6 1 15 10 17 29  Output 11 9   Explanation  In the 1st test case, primes in the range 1 to 6 are 2, 3 and 5. The numbers in the range 1 to 15 which are divisible by any of 2,3 or 5 are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15 (total 11).  In the 2nd test case, prime in the range 1 to 10 are 2, 3, 5 and 7. The number in the range 17 to 29 which are divisible by any of these primes are 18, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 (total 9).  
  Nitesh recently discovered a new game CODATHON with the help of a very intelligent alien friend Jupiter. In this game a student had various challenges and each challenge had infinite number of problems. The scoring system in this game was quite different. There are 2 ways of scoring on a given problem:  If you are in the first 200 to submit solution you get +a points,  In all other cases you get +b points,  Note : a,b are different for every challenge.   Now for a particular challenge with scores a and b, Nitesh wants to find out the largest score that is not possible to achieve. Also Nitesh decided not to make a>b always ( after all Jupiter suggested it & nobody knows why !!! :P ).    Input First Line of Input Contains T, Number of testcases, Each testcase has 2 numbers a and b.    Output For each testcase output the largest score which is not possible to achieve in a new line. If all scores are achievable print 'infinite solutions' without quotes. NOTE : The output in some cases can be extremely large, therefore print it modulo 10^9+7.    Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10^9 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^18 1 ≤ b ≤ 10^18     Example Input: 2 3 4 5 7  Output: 5 23    Explanation Example case 1: With a=3 and b=4, except 5 all scores are possible: eg. 6 = 3 + 3        7 = 3 + 4        8 = 4 + 4 and so on.

 Many years ago there was a kingdom called 'sentence', which comprises of two groups namely strings and integers. Strings consists of all the characters and alphabets(both capital and small) whereas the integers consists of all the kinds of numbers. 'A' was the leader of strings and was prefer over '0' the leader of integers by the people of the kingdom. King of the sentences was very old, so he kept a competition for deciding the next king. In the competition only 'A' and '0' participated. '0' knew that he was going to lose in the competition so he attacked on the strings. String 'X' came running to 'A' and told him that '0' is going to kill all the strings. 'A ' is terrified and wants to protect his group. He knows that if he wants to stop '0' he needs to remove all the integers from kingdom. So he asks your help in killing all the integers. Help 'A' in removing all the integers from the kingdom and hence protect all the strings.  Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.  Next T lines contain a sentence 'S' formed from integers and strings. The length of S is denoted by L. (it is guaranteed that after killing all the integers, L>0).   Output  Print the sentence consisting of only strings in the given order.    Constraints  2 < T < 1000 2 < L < 10000   Example Input: 2 CodeVaitam 2015@Nit agartala. Codechef  Output: CodeVaitam @Nit agartala. Codechef  
  Everyone knows the famous detective Sherlock. He has been handed over a new case of "The Abominable Bride". Each night she kills N people but to irritate Sherlock she leaves exactly one people. The way she kills the people is somewhat strange. She makes 1 to N people stand in a line and starts killing them. But, in the line when she kills the first person, there's time for the person standing next in line to run away at the end of the line.Again she kills the first person and the second one next to him runs to the last of the line. In this way after killing, there is exactly one person standing in the line who is saved and he runs to Sherlock to explain the situation each night. Help Sherlock find out the person that will be saved at the end of the massacre.  Constraints and Example Input: 5 2 4 6 9 12  Output: 2 4 4 2 8   Explanation  For the 2nd test case, she kills 1 and 2 goes at the end of line i.e., 3 4 2. Then she kills 3rd and 4th goes at the end of line i.e. 2 4. Then she kills 2 and ultimately 4th is the lone survivour. 
The auditorium of Stanford University is made up of L*R matrix (assume each coordinate has a chair). On the occasion of an event Chef was called as a chief guest. The auditorium was filled with males (M) and females (F), occupying one chair each. Our Chef is very curious guy, so he asks the gatekeeper some queries. The queries were as follows: Is there any K*K sub-matrix in the auditorium which contains all Males or Females.  Input  The first line contains three space-separated integers L, R  and Q describing the dimension of the auditorium and the number of questions Chef will ask. Each of next L lines contains R characters (M or F). Next Q lines contains K and a character (M or F).   Output  For each query output "yes" (without quotes) if there exist any K*K sub-matrix in the auditorium which contains all Males (if he asks about Male) or Females (if he asks about Female), otherwise output "no" (without quotes).   Constraints and Example Input: 4 3 3 MMF MMM FFM FFM 2 F 3 M 1 M  Output: yes no yes

 Like most of the demanding childs.Pratik don't stop until he gets that.He keep on repeating the name of that thing again and again. For example if he want a computer,He will keep on repeating "computer" again and again. His dad has decided to answer to his demand as "Yes" or "No" without any delay.Otherwise there would be a lot of repercussions.So, randomly at certain interval,He just answer with "Yes" or "No" by using following rule that he will select two integers a and b, if the element at the position a is same as element at position b in the repeating chant pratik then he will speak "Yes", Otherwise he will say "No". Your work is to find the answer of his dad given the name of the demand that pratik is asking for and the random integer his dad has picked.   Input   First line of the input contains a string S, the name of the item he is demanding. Next line contains an integer T, the number of pairs of integer to answer "Yes" or "No". For each next N lines, each line contains two space separated integers ai and bi. Next T lines each contain 2 integers, a and b.    Output  For each query, print "Yes" or "No" as described above  Constraints   1 ≤ |S| ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ Q ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ a,b ≤ 10^18     Example Input: computer 4 3 7 2 10 5 21 11 26    Output:  No Yes Yes No   Explanation  In the first case the character at 3rd position is 'm' and the character at 7th position is 'e' so the answer is "No" In the second case the character at the 2nd position is 'o' and if we repeat the string (like computercomputercomputer...) the character at 10th position is 'o' so the answer is "Yes"  
In a country, a person's health and wealth is measured in terms of time(seconds) left. Suppose a person there has 24x60x60 = 86400 seconds left, then he would live for another 1 day. A person dies when his time left becomes 0. Some time-amount can be borrowed from other person, or time banks. Some time amount can also be lend to another person, or can be used to buy stuffs. The president of that country is in very critical condition and has very less time left. A bank is giving away free time amount worth 1000 years. Bank released N slips, A[1],A[2],...A[N]. Each slip has a time amount(can be +ve or -ve). A person can pick any number of slips(even none, or all of them, or some of them) out of the N slips. But bank introduced a restriction, they announced one more number K. Restriction is that, if a person picks a slip A[i], then the next slip that he can choose to pick will be A[i+K+1]. It means there should be a difference of atleast K between the indices of slips picked. Now slip(s) should be picked in such a way that their sum results in maximum positive time-amount sum possible with the given restriction. If you predict the maximum positive sum possible, then you win.   Input Format   First line of the test file contains single number T, the number of test cases to follow. Each test case consists of two lines. First line contains two numbers N and K , separated by a space. Second line contains the N numbers A[1], A[2] ..... A[N] separated by space.    Output  For every test case, output in a single line the maximum positive sum possible, that is output for the case.       Constraints  T = 250  N = 10000  -10^9 = A[i] = 10^9  0 = K = N-1    Example Input: 2 10 1 1  2  -3  -5  4  6  -3  2  -1 2 10 2 1  2  -3  -5  4  6  -3  2  -1  2 Output: 12 10   Explanation  1st Case: We can take slips { A[2]=2, A[6]=6, A[8]=2, A[10]=2 }, slips are atleast 1 indices apart this makes maximum sum, A[2]+A[6]+A[8]+A[10]=12 2nd Case: We can take slips { A[2]=2, A[6]=6, A[10]=2 }, slips are atleast 2 indices apart this makes maximum sum, A[2]+A[6]+A[10]=10  
you have to convert a code for the old version of compiler to the code for a new version of compiler. In the old compiler we have used "->" for pointers and the new compiler use "." for pointers.Now we need to replace each "->" with "." but not in the comments of the code.A comment starts with "//" in the line and terminates at the end of the line.     Input   Max. 2000 lines of code each line of code have maximum of 60 characters.    Output  The new code with required changes.    Example Input:  int t;   //variable t t->a = 0;    // -> denotes the pointer t->c = 5; return 0;  // -> is not used   Output: int t;   //variable t t.a = 0;   // -> denotes the pointer t.c = 5; return 0;  // -> is not used    Explanation  "->" is not converted to "." in the comments of 2nd and 4th line.   
ALICE and BOB are playing a game with strings. Both of them have a string of length N consisting of lower case characters only.   A permutation of “abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz” is given in the input that defines the POWER of the characters (a-z). The position of the character starting from the left defines the POWER of a character. The position of the leftmost character is taken to be 0. If a character is common to both the strings, it is destroyed. The powers of the leftout characters of each of the strings are added separately.  If a character is repeated, then power of only one such character is added. Person with the string of HIGHER POWER wins.   ALICE and BOB want to check if you are smart enough to declare the winner in advance!! Are you ready? ;)   Input The first line of the input contains an integer T, denoting the length of the conversation, and the string M, denoting a permutation of the string "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" which defines the power of characters. T and M are separated by exactly one space. The description of T test cases follows. In each of the test cases, FIRST line contains ALICE’s string and SECOND line contains BOB’s string.     Output For each query, output on a separate line the winner of the game as “ALICE” or “BOB” and “TIE” in case of a tie. Quotes for clarity only. .      Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 30000 SIze of each string <= 100     Example Input: 3 wmbqkhasuftlcnerdzoxviypjg jack jill dwarka moksha umytissv hlovhsny  Output: BOB ALICE TIE    Explanation Example case 1. In the first case both the 'j' are cancelled out then the strength of alice's string is (6+12+4) 22 and for bob's string is (21+11) 32 therefore BOB is the answer.  Example case 2.In the second test case one 'a' and 'k' are cancelled out the strength of alice's string is (6+16+15+0) 37 and for bob's string is (5+1+18+7) 31 therefore ALICE is the answer.

  There are N villages in zoozoo land. Every year it rains in only one village but all others need water. The water is sufficient to fill needs of all the villages but they have shortage of connecting pipes. So they take raw material from earth to build their pipeline system.  The data is corrupted so we only have information about distances between M pairs of villages. It is guaranteed that each and every village is present in data.  Your task is to design a pipeline system connecting all the villages such that minimum length of pipes is used. You have to give that minimum length of pipes.   Input The first line of the input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.

   The Chef is fond of polynomials so he decides to fix the rate of the food items in the form of a polynomial equation for his hotel. He decides to put the rate of the items in the form of coefficients of the polynomial where, if the  rate of tea is "a1" and rate of sandwich is "a2”  and so on, then the rate list will be in the form of a0 *x^0+ a1 *x^1.......aN-1 *x^(N-1). But his competitor Ciel copies this policy .In the same way, Ciel also designs a polynomial rate list for his hotel. But this makes the condition miserable for both of them as the profit gets divided in an unbalanced form. So both of them decide to multiply the coefficient of their polynomial and get a resultant polynomial. They put the resultant list on their rate boards. But they are weak in mathematics so help them to do this task!!     Input First line of the Input contains T, the number of test cases.  Each test case is given as follows: Two space separated integers ,  N1 and N2 which denote the degree of polynomials of Chef and Ciel respectively.

Bob has recently learnt how to play basketball and he was told by Alice that the rules in basketball were as follows : • 1 point for a free throw • 2 points for a throw from within the D • 3 points for a throw from outside the D Being an inquisitive mind that Bob is, he would like to know how many combinations of 1-pointers, 2-pointers and 3-pointers can lead to a team score of N points. Now if a team has scored enough points, Bob wouldn't be able to remember the number of possible combinations long enough to show-off in front of your friends. So you decide to keep track of result modulo 100001. Help Bob to compute the number of combinations of 1-pointers, 2-pointers and 3-pointers that can lead to a team score of N points.   Input The first line contains single integer T - the number of test cases. T test cases follow.For each test case input will just be a number which denotes the team score N.  Output Output should be number of combinations of 1-pointers, 2-pointers and 3-pointers that can lead to the given team score modulo 100001.

Its the 22nd century and the terror of Codezilla is at its height. Codezilla is the most evil and dangerous hacker that ever existed. He has broken all systems of governance and the world has descended into anarchy. Eon, a young hacker, is fed up with the situation and has decided to put an end to Codezilla.   Eon meets a mysterious man called Cypher who is on the same mission. He tells Eon that to fight against Codezilla first he needs to get out of the real world and enter the Matrix. For this he needs to take some pills.  Cypher gives a set of pills to Eon. There are three types of pills: Blue,Red and Green. Eon can select any number of consecutive pills but he must take atleast one red pill, one blue pill and one green pill to enter the matrix. As eating more pills can be harmful, help Eon select the minimum number of pills.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each of the next T lines contains a string depicting the set of pills. Each character of the string is 'B', 'R' or 'G' standing for blue, red and green pills respectively.  Output For every test case, print in a single line the minimum number of consecutive pills that Eon should take so that he gets atleast one pill of each colour.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 3 ≤ Length of string ≤ 100000 The input string will contain atleast one each of 'B', 'R' and 'G'.     Example Input: 2 BBRG RGGGBBR  Output: 3 4  Explanation Example case 1. Eon selects the pills from 2 to 4, so he takes 3 pills. Example case 2. Eon can select 5 pills from 1 to 5 or he can select 4 pills from 4 to 7. So the answer is 4. 
Eon is still on his quest to defeat Codezilla but he is stuck. He has reached a secret vault which according to Cypher, contains valuable information about Codezilla's information systems. But the vault is password locked. Till now Eon has been able to decipher the following things about the password:  Maximum possible length of the password The string S such that each character of the password is smaller than or equal to the corresponding character of S. password[i]<=S[i] ( 0 <= i < |S| ). Also the password will be lexicographically smaller than S. The password consists of only small English alphabets 'a' to 'z'.   Now Eon makes a brute force program to enter all possible passwords. Tell him the maximum number of attempts he would have to make to get the correct password.   NOTE : The string A = A1...AN is called lexicographically smaller than the string B = B1...BN if there exists K from 1 to N, inclusive, such that Ai = Bi for i = 1, ..., K-1, and AK < BK. We compare small letters by their positions in the English alphabet. So 'a' is the smallest letter, 'b' is the second smallest letter, ..., 'z' is the largest letter.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains the maximum possible length of the password L and the second line contains the string S.  Output For every test case, print in a single line the answer for the corresponding input. Since the answer can be very large, print the answer modulo 1000000007.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ |S| ≤ 10000 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9   Example Input: 2 2 b 3 abc  Output: 27 8  Explanation Example case 1. Eon will need to enter "a","aa","ab","ac","ad",..."az". So answer is 27. Example case 2. Eon will need to enter "a","aa","aaa","aab","aac","ab","aba","abb". So the answer is 8. 
In the secret vault, Eon gets information about the existence of Codezilla's castle and he finds a map with its location. But on his way to the castle, Eon encounters a maze. Now this is no ordinary maze. The maze is in the form of a rectangle with n rows and m columns. Each cell of the maze is a room and a room in the ith row and jth column is addressed as room(i,j). Rows are numbered from 1 to n from bottom to top and columns are numbered from 1 to m from left to right. The maze has two types of rooms: type A and type B. In each room of type A, there is a monster who is very hungry and Eon must give him a candy otherwise the monster will eat him. The room also contains one gold coin. In each room of type B, there is a guard who is very greedy and Eon must give him a gold coin otherwise the guard will kill him. The room also contains a candy. Every room has a door to every adjacent room (Rooms that share an edge are adjacent rooms). Before entering the maze Eon has the choice of taking either a gold coin or a candy. Eon enters the maze from room(1,1) and he has to reach the room(n,m) to get out of the maze. Eon does not have much time. Tell Eon the minimum number of rooms he needs to visit to get out of the maze alive.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. First line of each test case consists of two integers n and m.Then follows n lines with m characters each describing the maze. '0' for room of type A and '1' for room of type B.  Output For every test case print the minimum number of rooms Eon needs to visit to get out of the maze. If it is not possible to cross the maze, print "-1" without the quotes.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000     Example Input: 2 3 3 011 001 000 2 2 11 00  Output: 5 -1 
After crossing the maze, Eon has finally reached Codezilla's castle. But entering the castle is not going to be so easy. In his early days, Codezilla used to be an ace competitive programmer. He knew such a day would come when someone like Eon will rise against him. So instead of a password, Codezilla has set a programming problem to enter the castle. The puzzle is as follows: You are given three integers N,X and M. Then there are M queries each containing two integers L and R. For each query you have to print the count of numbers Y such that L<=Y<=R and GCD(N,Y)=X. Eon has always been more into development rather than competitive programming. So help him solve the puzzle.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. First line of each test case consists of three integers N, X and M. Each of the next M lines contains two integers L and R.  Output Print the answer of each query in a separate line.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^9 1 ≤ X ≤ N ≤ 10^9 1 ≤ M ≤ 1000 1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ 10^9   Example Input: 1 10 2 2 1 10 5 5  Output: 4 0  Explanation Example case 1. From 1 to 10, there are 4 numbers 2, 4, 6 and 8 such that their GCD with 10 is 2. 
Now its time for the final battle between Eon and Codezilla. There are N weapons available numbered from 1 to N. The cost of weapon i is C[i] (1<=i<=N). There will be M attacks. In each attack Eon will choose K weapons from the range of weapons numbered between L and R (both inclusive). All weapons have the same damage power. Eon wants to spend the minimum amount possible for each attack .Tell Eon the amount that he will need to spend for each attack.  Input First line of the input contains an integer N. The next line contains N space separated integers representing the array C representing the cost of the weapons. Next line contains an integer M. Each of the next M lines contains three integers L, R and K.  Output Output should consists of M lines. The i'th line should contain the minimum amount that Eon needs to spend for the i'th attack. Since the answer can be large, output the answer modulo 10^9+7.  Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 20000 1 ≤ M ≤ 20000 1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ N 1 ≤ K ≤ R-L+1 1 ≤ C[i] ≤ 10^9   Example Input: 5 9 3 5 3 1 2 1 3 2 2 5 3  Output: 8 7  Explanation Example case 1. Eon will choose the weapons 2 and 3. So the answer is 3+5=8. Example case 2.  Eon will choose the weapons 2, 4 and 5. So the answer is 1+3+3=7 
Working from left-to-right if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its left it is called an increasing number; for example, 22344. Similarly if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its right it is called a decreasing number; for example, 774410 we shall call a positive integer that is neither increasing nor decreasing a “bouncy” number; for example, 155349.WAP to check whether a number is bouncy or not.  Input The input consists of one number given as input at a time,the program checks if the number is bouncy or not.The number of test cases have to be specified in the first input.

A Discrete Mathematics professor has a class of NN students. Frustrated with their lack of discipline, he decides to cancel class if fewer than KK students are present when class starts. Given the arrival time of each student, determine if the class is canceled. Input Format The first line of input contains TT, the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line has two space-separated integers, NN (students in the class) and KK (the cancelation threshold). The second line contains NN space-separated integers (a1,a2,…,aNa1,a2,…,aN) describing the arrival times for each student. Note: Non-positive arrival times (ai?0ai?0) indicate the student arrived early or on time; positive arrival times (ai>0ai>0) indicate the student arrived aiai minutes late. Output Format For each test case, print the word YES if the class is canceled or NO if it is not. Constraints 1?T?101?T?10 1?N?10001?N?1000 1?K?N1?K?N ?100?ai?100,where i?[1,N]?100?ai?100,where i?[1,N] Note If a student arrives exactly on time (ai=0)(ai=0), the student is considered to have entered before the class started. Sample Input 2 4 3 -1 -3 4 2 4 2 0 -1 2 1 Sample Output YES NO Explanation For the first test case, K=3K=3. The professor wants at least 33 students in attendance, but only 22 have arrived on time (?3?3 and ?1?1). Thus, the class is canceled. For the second test case, K=2K=2. The professor wants at least 22 students in attendance, and there are 22 who have arrived on time (00 and ?1?1). Thus, the class is not canceled 
Jasmine is a very lazy girl. She always sleeps in Maths class. One day her teacher catches her sleeping and tells her that he would mark her absent for the whole semester. While he pretends to be strict, he is actually very kind-hearted. So he wants to give Jasmine a chance to prove herself. He gives her a problem. If Jasmine can answer it correctly, he will forgive her. Can you help Jasmine find the answer to this problem? The problem: The teacher gives Jasmine a number N and asks her to find out the probability that any proper divisor of N would be an even perfect square. Note: Even perfect square means the number should be even and a perfect square. Input Format The first line of input contains an integer T, the number of test cases. T lines follow, each line containing N, the number that the teacher provides. Output Format For each test case, print in a newline the output in p/q format where p and q are positive coprime integers. If p is 0, you should simply output 0. Constraints 1<=T<=4×10^4 2<=N<=10^6 Sample Input  4 2 8 36 900 Sample Output  0 1/3 1/8 3/26 
A forward shifted alphabet code is a form of coding in which each letter has been shifted for a particular number. For example, if a message has been encrypted by shifting 2, then 'C' will be written in place of 'A' , 'B' in place of 'Z', 'A' in place of 'Y' and so on. Such integers are the keys to decode shifted alphabet codes. Thaton likes sending encoded messages(only alphabets) to Pravakar. So to decode those messages she gave him N alarm clocks, all set at 12 O' clock with batteries removed, placed sequentially in a box. The alarm clocks rings every  { x1,x2,x3,x4,..........,xn }  hours respectively. While sending the message, she tells Pravakar not to consider a continuous sequence of alarm clocks in the set from positions L to R i.e from XL to XR is not under consideration and ask him to insert the batteries in the rest of the alarm clocks (except alarm clocks from L to R) and informs him that the minimum number of hours after which all the clocks under consideration ring simultaneously is the key to her message. Help Pravakar!! Note :  Shifting of character occurs in a circular manner, i.e. if 'y' need to be shifted forward by 2, 	Then y+2='a' i.e in forward shifting, after z we starts with 'a' again, and in backward shifting , after 'a' we again starts with 'z' e.g back shift 'c' by 5 will be : 'x'.   Input   1st Line contains a single integer N denoting numbers of alarm clocks. 2nd line contains N space separated integers { x1,x2,x3,x4,..........,xn } as described in the statement. 3rd line contains a single integer Q denoting the number of Queries. 1st line for each query contains two space separated integers L and R. 2nd line for each query contains the encoded message.   Output For each Query, print the decoded message in a line.  Constraints  1 <=N,Xi,L,R <=20 1 <=Q <=200 1 <= Length of Encoded Message<=256   Sample Input: 3 1 2 3 1 3 3 YgneqogvqVgejnqp Output: WelcometoTechlon  Explanation One of the clock rings every hour while the other rings every 2 hours and since the value of L =3 and R=3, So third clock is not under consideration. So, the 1st and 2nd clock will ring together after two hours. In other words, all the letters in the given string has been shifted forward by 2. So to decode the message, we have to shift each character backward by 2 
 The Wonderking in Wonderland had a great friend called Wondermath a professor in mathematics. The king and the professor shared everything, they were same age, married same day, have same number of children etc. To represent this friendship  professor Wondermath introduced Amicable numbers, a pair who is friends like him and king.  Amicable numbers are a pair of numbers with the following property: the sum of all of the proper divisors of the first number (not including itself) exactly equals the second number while the sum of all of the proper divisors of the second number (not including itself) likewise equals the first number. The set of 220 and 284 was the first known set of amicable numbers. Pythagoras discovered the relationship and coined the term amicable because he considered the numbers to be a symbol of friendship. For example:  For example let's show that  220 & 284 are amicable numbers: First we find the proper divisors of 220:  1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, 110  If you add up all of these numbers you will see that they sum to 284.   Now find the proper divisors of 284:   1, 2, 4, 71, 142  These sum to 220, and therefore 220 & 284 are amicable numbers. To satisfy his friend Wonderking, professor wants to find many Amicable numbers before the tea time tomorrow. You must develop a program that declares a number is amicable or not in order to help professor WonderMath.    Input The first line of the input file contains the number cases (<10) followed by set of numbers ( < 100,000,000) one in each new line which you have to declare amicable or not.  Output If the number is not an amicable number it should print no, if it is an amicable number it should print yes and the amicable number of it.  Example Input: 4 1184 2620 3550 5020   Output: Yes, amicable with 1210 Yes, amicable with 2924 No Yes, amicable with 5564   Explanation Explained in the above section. 
 WonderKing himself is a very genius in mathematics. One day when he was thinking, king got a wonderful idea – circular prime. A circular prime is a prime number with the property that the number generated at each intermediate step when cyclically permuting its (base 10) digits will be a prime. Simply if all the rotational digits of a number are themselves primes, it is called a circular prime number. Let's see an example where numbers are generated by cyclically permuting the digits of 19937. The first digit is removed and readded at the right side of the remaining string of digits. This process is repeated until the starting number is reached again. Since all intermediate numbers generated by this process are prime, 19937 is a circular prime. 19937 is the first circular prime WonderKing encountered. 199379937193719371997199319937 Later he was managed get the first 10 circular primes, they will be 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 37, 79, 113. You have to help him to find more circular primes.  Input Input description. Tips:  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases, i.e. number of cases you are required to check. T is followed by the numbers you need to check whether they are circular primes or not   Output If a certain number is a circular prime print yes. If not a circular prime print no.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 Each and every test case would be less than 1,000,000   Example Input: 5 3 113 67 9311 19  Output: Yes Yes No Yes No  
Aliens are planning to attack on Earth. Scientists at ISRO got a breakthrough when they were able to intercept the message being transferred in between aliens, but the problem is that aliens are using a technique for encrypting the message. Codefest team of IT-BHU were able to hack into the systems of aliens and decipher the method, the aliens were using for encryption but a method for decryption has not been found yet. You are required to decrypt the message. The method used for encryption is explained below: Consider a string of N alphabets for example encrypt (N=7). The string is treated as if the last character wraps around back to the first. Next consider a set S of N different strings, in which each string is formed by cyclic rotation of the alphabets of the original string. So for the string encrypt, S = {encrypt, ncrypte, crypten, ryptenc, yptencr, ptencry, tencryp} The next step is to perform a lexicographical sort in decreasing order on the set of above strings. So S becomes {yptencr, tencryp, ryptenc, ptencry, ncrypte, encrypt, crypten} Now, the encyrpted string of N alphabets is formed taking the last character from the above sorted strings. For given example, the encrypted string is rpcyetn. They also send the position of the first character of the encrypted string so that the message can be decrypted i.e. 5 for the given example.  Input There is a single integer T<=200 on the first line of input which denotes the number of test cases to follow. Each of the next T lines, contains a string made up of k alphabets (a-z characters only) followed by an integer N, separated by a blankspace. 1<=N<=k<=3000.  Output Output consists of T lines, each containing the decrypted string.  Example  Input: 3 rpcyetn 5 rathe 5 aabb 2 Output: encrypt earth abab 
Run-length encoding(RLE) is a very simple and easy form of data compression in which consecutive occurrences of the same characters are replaced by a single character followed by its frequency. As an example, the string S  aabbbbdaa would be encoded to a2b4d1a2. Thus encoded string is described as an ordered sequence of pairs (a, i), each consisting of an alphabet symbol a and an integer i. Each pair corresponds to a run in S consisting of i consecutive occurrences of a. In this problem, we are interested in finding the minimum number of mutation(s) needed to transform first string given in encoded form into second string i.e. edit distance when only two operation are allowed  Add any character at any position(insertion) Remove any character from any position(deletion)  The cost of inserting a character is 1 and cost of deleting a character is 2.  Input The input file contains several test cases. The first line of the input denotes the number of test cases, T (1≤T≤100) to follow. Each test case begins on a new line and consists of an integer L1, a blankspace and a run length encoded string S1 and then on a new line, an integer L2, a blankspace and a run length encoded string S2. L1 and L2 denote the number of runs in strings S1 and S2 respectively. 1<=L1,L2<=100. S1 and S2 consists of alphabets [a-z] followed by number of consecutive occurrences of  that character. You can safely assume that the total length of any of the strings will not exceed 3000 characters.  Output For each test case, output the edit distance from S1 to S2 in a new line.   Example  Input: 2 2 a3b2 1 b3 3 a1b1a1 1 a2 Output: 7 2

For each test case there will be two lines – the first one representing the length of the sequence & second one representing the sequence itself.       Output For each test case, output one line containing the length of  the longest monotone subsequence for that test case..    Constraints  1 ≤ Length ≤ 20 1 ≤ N ≤ 10     Example Input:4 6 1 1 1 2 0 2 10 1 2 9 4 7 3 11 8 14 6 11 0 3 5 2 9 11 8 10 13 20 19 16 0  8  4  12  2  10  6  14  1  9  5  13  3  11  7  15  Output:2 6 7 6    
You are given two positive integers – A and B. You have to check whether A is divisible by all the prime divisors of B.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. For each test case, you are given two space separated integers – A and B.  Output For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if A contains all prime divisors of B, otherwise print "No".  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4 1 ≤ A, B ≤ 10^18   Example Input: 3 120 75 128 16 7 8  Output: Yes Yes No   Explanation Example case 1. In the first case 120 = 2^3*3*5 and 75 = 3*5^2. 120 is divisible by both 3 and 5. Hence, we will print "Yes" Example case 2. In the second case both 128 and 16 are powers of two. Hence, the answer is "Yes" Example case 3. In the third case 8 is power of two and 7 is not divisible by 2. So, the answer is "No" 
Chef is playing a game with his friend Misha. They have a pile containg N coins. Players take alternate turns, removing some coins from the pile. On each turn, a player can remove either one coin or coins equal to some prime power (i.e. p^x coins, where p - prime number and x - positive integer). Game ends when the pile becomes empty. The player who can not make a move in his turn loses.  Chef plays first. Your task is to find out who will win the game, provided that both of the player play optimally.  Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains one integer N.   Output  For each test case, output a single line containing one word - the name of the winner of the game. Print "Chef" (without quotes) if Chef wins the game, print "Misha" (without quotes) otherwise.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 1000 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^9   Example Input: 2 1 8  Output: Chef Chef  Explanation Example case 1. Chef will remove the only coin from the pile and will win the game. Example case 2. Chef will remove all 8 coins from the pile and win the game. Chef can remove 8 coins because 8 is a prime power, as 8 = 2^3. 
 The Head Chef is receiving a lot of orders for cooking the best of the problems lately. For this, he organized an hiring event to hire some talented Chefs. He gave the following problem to test the skills of the participating Chefs. Can you solve this problem and be eligible for getting hired by Head Chef.   A non-negative number n is said to be magical if it satisfies the following property. Let S denote the multi-set of numbers corresponding to the non-empty subsequences of the digits of the number n in decimal representation. Please note that the numbers in the set S can have leading zeros. Let us take an element s of the multi-set S, prod(s) denotes the product of all the digits of number s in decimal representation. The number n will be called magical if sum of prod(s) for all elements s in S, is even.  For example, consider a number 246, its all possible non-empty subsequence will be S = {2, 4, 6, 24, 46, 26, 246}. Products of digits of these subsequences will be {prod(2) = 2, prod(4) = 4, prod(6) = 6, prod(24) = 8, prod(46) = 24, prod(26) = 12, prod(246) = 48, i.e. {2, 4, 6, 8, 24, 12, 48}. Sum of all of these is 104, which is even. Hence 246 is a magical number.  Please note that multi-set S can contain repeated elements, e.g. if number is 55, then S = {5, 5, 55}. Products of digits of these subsequences will be {prod(5) = 5, prod(5) = 5, prod(55) = 25}, i.e. {5, 5, 25}. Sum of all of these is 35 which is odd. Hence 55 is not a magical number.  Consider a number 204, then S = {2, 0, 4, 20, 04, 24, 204}. Products of digits of these subsequences will be {2, 0, 4, 0, 0, 8, 0}. Sum of all these elements will be 14 which is even. So 204 is a magical number.   The task was to simply find the K^th magical number.   Input  First line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each of the next T lines contains a single integer K.   Output For each test case, print a single integer corresponding to the K^th magical number.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^12.   Example Input: 2 2 5  Output: 2 8  Explanation Example case 1. 2 is the 2^nd magical number, since it satisfies the property of the magical number. The first magical number will be of course 0.  
Chef has an array A consisting of N integers. He also has an intger K. Chef wants you to find out number of different arrays he can obtain from array A by applying the following operation exactly K times.  Pick some element in the array and multiply it by -1   As answer could be quite large, print it modulo 10^9 + 7.   Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers N, K as defined above. The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the elements of the array.   Output  For each test case, output a single line containing an integer corresponding to the number of different arrays Chef can get modulo 10^9 + 7.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ N, K ≤ 10^5 -10^6 ≤ Ai ≤ 10^6   Example Input: 3 1 3 100 3 1 1 2 1 3 2 1 2 1  Output: 1 3 4  Explanation Example case 1. Chef has only one element and must apply the operation 3 times to it. After applying the operations, he will end up with -100. That is the only array he will get.  Example case 2. Chef can apply operation to one of three elements. So, he can obtain three different arrays.  Example case 3. Note that other than applying operation to positions (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), Chef can also apply the operation twice on some element and get the original.  In summary, Chef can get following four arrays.  [1, 2, 1] [-1, -2, 1] [-1, 2, -1] [1, -2, -1] 
 Chef once wanted to count the number of vertex disjoint cycle covers of a directed graph. A cycle cover is a set of cycles covering the set of vertices (A set of cycles S is said to be covering set of vertices if each vertex lies in at least one of the cycles in S). A vertex disjoint cycle cover is a cycle cover in which no two cycles have any common vertex. A cycle is a sequence of t > 1 distinct vertices a1, a2, ..., at such that there is an edge from ai to ai+1 for 1 <= i < t and an edge from at to a1.  Chef has a directed graph G containing n vertices and m edges. You have to help the chef in finding out the number of vertex disjoint cycle covers in it. As the answer could be very large, please print it modulo 10^9 + 7.   Input  First line of the input contains a single integer T denoting number of test cases. Description of T test cases follows. First line of each test case will contain two integers: n, m denoting number of vertices and number of edges in the graph G. For next m lines, each line will contain two space separated integers: u, v denoting that there is an edge from u to v in the graph.   Output  For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting the answer to the problem.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 5 1 ≤ n ≤ 20 0 ≤ m ≤ n × (n - 1) 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n u != v It is guaranteed that no edge repeats in the input. So all ordered (u, v) pairs (represending edges in the graph) appearing in the input will be distinct.   Example Input: 4 3 3 1 2 2 3 3 1 4 4 1 2 2 1 3 4 4 3 2 1 1 2 4 8 1 2 2 1 2 4 4 2 1 3 3 1 3 4 4 3  Output: 1 1 0 4  Explanation Example case 1. There is exactly one vertex disjoint cycle cover. ie. (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1) Example case 2. There is exactly one vertex disjoint cycle cover in this graph too. Collection of cycles in that cycle cover will be (1 -> 2 -> 1) and (3 -> 4 -> 3) Example case 3. There is no vertex disjoint cycle cover in this case, as (1 -> 2) is not a cycle. 
 There are n trees on a road in Chef's garden. Each tree has one of the three colours out of red, green or blue. You are given information about the colours of the trees by a string s. if s[i] is 'R', it means that i^th tree is red. Similarly 'G' denotes green and 'B' denotes blue colored tree.  Chef likes to create a beautiful pattern out of the tree colours. A pattern is called beautiful if all the trees of the same colour are continuous. eg. "RRBGG" and "GGBBB" are beautiful patterns, but "RGRB" is not a beautiful pattern because trees of red color are not continuous.   For achieving beautiful pattern, chef is permitted to change the colours of the trees. For changing the colour of i^th tree from any colour to any other colour, he needs to pay a cost of c[i] rupees. Find out the minimum amount of rupees the chef requires, to create a beautiful pattern out of the colours of the n trees.   Input  First line of the input contains a single integer T denoting number of test cases. Description of T test cases follows. First line of each test case will contain a single integer n denoting number of trees on the road in chef's garden. Second line will contain a single line containing string s as defined in the problem. Third line will contain n space separated integers denoting the array c, i.e. c[1], c[2], .., c[n].   Output  For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting minimum amount of rupees needed to create a beautiful pattern.   Constraints  1 ≤ T, n ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ c[i] ≤ 10^9  Sum of n over all the test cases won't exceed 10^6   Example Input: 3 3 RGB 1 2 3 3 RRR 1 2 3 3 RBR 1 2 3  Output: 0 0 1  Explanation Example case 1. Pattern is already beautiful. There is no need to pay any cost. Example case 2. Pattern is already beautiful. There is no need to pay any cost. Example case 3. Change colour of the first tree to blue. Then the pattern will BBR, which is beautiful pattern. Cost required will be 1. There is no way to create a beautiful pattern by paying less than 1 rupee. Hence answer is 1. 
 Chef goes to the market to buy a laptop. He enters a shop which has n laptops on display. Cost of i^th laptop is c[i].   Chef wants to buy a single laptop by paying least amount of money. But there is an issue: when there are two or more laptops available at the same cost, he gets confused about which one he should buy, so in turn, he can't buy any of those.   Find the minimum amount of money he needs to pay to buy a single laptop. It is guaranteed that there is always a way to buy a laptop.   Input  First line of the input contains contains a single integer T denoting number of test cases. For each test case there will be two lines. First line of each test case will contain a single integer n denoting number of laptops available. Second line of each test case will contain n space separated integers denoting array c i.e. c[1], c[2], .., c[n] as defined in the problem.   Output  For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting minimum amount of money needed for Chef to buy a laptop.   Constraints  1 ≤ T, n ≤ 100 1 ≤ c[i] ≤ 100   Example Input: 3 2 1 2 3 1 1 2 6 3 5 4 4 3 3 Output: 1 2 5  Explanation Example case 1. He can buy the cheapest laptop i.e. cost = 1. Example case 2. He can't buy any laptop with cost 1 because there are more than 1 (i.e. 2) such laptops and Chef will be confused in choosing. So he will choose the unique laptop with cost = 2. Example case 3. He can't buy any of the laptops with cost 3 because there are more than 1 (i.e. 3) such laptops and Chef will be confused in choosing. Similarly, he also can't buy laptops with cost 4. So he will choose the unique laptop with cost = 5. 
Every great chef knows that lucky numbers are positive integers whose decimal representations contain only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not. Our chef has recently returned from the Lucky country. He observed that every restaurant in the Lucky country had a lucky number as its name. He believes that having a lucky number as a restaurant name can indeed turn out to be very lucky. Our chef believes that it is possible to make a lucky number having N digits even luckier. Any number following the rules below is called Lucky lucky number -  1. The number contains only digits 4 and 7.  2. Count of digit 4 in the number should be divisible by 7.  3. Count of digit 7 in the number should be divisible by 4. Help our chef to compute the count of digit 4 in the smallest Lucky lucky number having N digits.  Input  First line contains T, number of test cases. Each of the next T lines contains a number N, the number of digits in the Lucky lucky number to be formed. 1<=T<=1000 1<=N<=1000000000 (10^9)  Output  If it is not possible to form a Lucky lucky number having N digits, output -1. Otherwise, output the count of digit 4 in the smallest Lucky lucky number having N digits.  Example  Input: 5 7 4 11 1 15  Output: 7 0 7 -1 7  Explanation For the last test case, N = 15, the smallest lucky lucky number is 444444477777777. The count of digit 4 is 7.  
Chef is very fond of squares but he didn't like rectangles at all instead he fears from them. To make him comfortable with the rectangles his teacher gave him a simple task. His teacher gave him a 2D matrix of N X M size , where n is number of rows and m is number of columns. He has to print the elements of the matrix in Diagonal wise.     For the matrix shown in image traversal is: 3 7 9 98 88 7 90 2 34 2 2 7 NOTE: Due to large Input Output file it is preferred to use fast input output methods.  Input: The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting number of test cases.For each testcase:  First line contains two space separated integers N, M. Next N lines contains M space seprated Integers.    Output Output a single line containing N X M space separated numbers Diagonal wise of given Matrix.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ N, M ≤ 500 1 ≤ Elements of Matrix ≤ 10^9    Example Input: 12 33 1 68 6 4  Output: 3 1 8 6 6 4 
Tic-Tac-Toe used to be Chef's favourite game during his childhood. Reminiscing in his childhood memories, he decided to create his own "Tic-Tac-Toe", with rules being similar to the original Tic-Tac-Toe, other than the fact that it is played on an NxN board.   The game is played between two players taking turns. First player puts an 'X' in an empty cell of the board, then the second player puts an 'O' in some other free cell. If the first player has K continuous X's or the second player has K continuous O's in row, column or diagonal, then he wins.   Chef started playing this new "Tic-Tac-Toe" with his assistant, beginning as the first player himself (that is, Chef plays 'X's). Currently, the game is ongoign, and it's Chef's turn. However, he needs to leave soon to begin tonight's dinner preparations, and has time to play only one more move. If he can win in one move, output "YES", otherwise output "NO" (without quotes). It is guaranteed that no player has already completed the winning criterion before this turn, and that it's a valid "Tic-Tac-Toe" game.  Input The first line of input contains one integer T denoting the number of testcases. First line of each testcase contains two integers N and K, next N lines contains N characters each. Each character is either an 'X' denoting that the first player used this cell, an 'O' meaning that the second player used this cell, or a '.' (a period) representing a free cell.   Output For each testcase, output, in a single line, "YES" if Chef can win in one move, or "NO" otherwise.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 3 ≤ N ≤ 20 1 ≤ K ≤ N   Example Input: 3 3 3 XOX O.O XOX 3 1 ... ... ... 3 2 ... ... ...   Output: YES YES NO  Input: 1 4 4 XOXO OX.. XO.. OXOX  Output: YES   Subtasks  Subtask 1:  K  = 1. Points - 10 Subtask 2:  N  =  K  = 3. Points - 30 Subtask 3: Original constraints. Points - 60   Explanation  Test #1: In first testcase, put 'X' in (2, 2), in second we can put 'X' in any cell and win. Test #2: If you put an 'X' in (3, 3), there will be four 'X's on the main diagonal (1, 1) - (2, 2) - (3, 3) - (4, 4).  
The chef is fond of triangles. He has a task for you. You are given n point out of which only k are collinear. Find the number of triangles that can be formed from these n points. You have to perform the above task for a number of test cases.    Input The first line of input contains the number of test cases, t. Then t lines follow each containing 2 space separated integers n and k.  Output The output contains t lines each containing the answer for that particular test case. Each line contains the number triangles that can be formed for that particular test.  Constraints 1<=t<=1000 3<=n<=1000000 3<=k<=n  Example Input: 1 30 5 Output: 4050 
The chef has a book stand. He and his friend bought some books (say n). The book stand has only 2 empty shelves. The chef made an observation that the paper quality, the weight of a single paper and the dimensions of all the books are the same. The chef made a restriction, to the books that can be kept on the shelves. He said only m (an integer) books can be placed on the top shelf and rest of the books are to be placed on the bottom shelf. There is one more condition that has to be satisfied, that is, the difference between the sum of the weight of the books on the top shelf and the sum of weight of the books on the bottom shelf should be the most among all such arrangements possible. Your task is to calculate this maximum difference for a number of test cases.   Input 1.	The first line of input contains the number of test cases, t. 2.	Description of each test case:  The first line contains 2 space separated integer n and m, the  number of books and the number of books that can be kept on the top  shelf respectively.  	The next line contains n space separated integers P[0], p[1], p[2],.... p[n-1], here p[i] is the number of pages in the (i+1)th book.   NOTE: Assume the the weight of one page is 1 unit. Calculate the difference in this unit.  Output The output contains t lines, each contains an integer, denoting the maximum difference for that particular test case.  Constraints 1<=20<=t 1<=n<=10000 Assume 1<=m <= n / 2 1<=p[i] <= 1000000  Sample Test cases Input: 1 5 2 4 1 3 2 5  Output: 9 
You are given a string of lower case characters. You have to find the character with the most frequency. In case there are 2 such characters, consider the one with lower ASCII value. After this replace the character with the maximum frequency with '?' (without quotes). Then, print the resulting string. You have to do this for a number of test cases.   Input The first line of input contains the number of test cases. Then t lines follow, each containing a string s of lower case characters.  Output The output contains t lines, one for each test case, each containing the resultant string for that test case.  Constraints 1<=t<=100 1<=|S|<=1000, |S| is the length of the string S.  Example Input: 1 aba Output: ?b? 
 Problem description.  time given to them. The faculty has thus decided to encode the questions, which the students will then have to decode. They have decided to enlist your help in this - don’t get too happy, you won’t be told the questions which will be coming in your exam. Given the question and an integer N, you are supposed to find the encoded question, such that each letter of the alphabet in the question will be offset by that integer N.

Gru has not been in the limelight for a long time and is, therefore, planning something particularly nefarious. Frustrated by his minions' incapability which has kept him away from the limelight, he has built a transmogrifier — a machine which mutates minions.   Each minion has an intrinsic characteristic value (similar to our DNA), which is an integer. The transmogrifier adds an integer K to each of the minions' characteristic value.   Gru knows that if the new characteristic value of a minion is divisible by 7, then it will have Wolverine-like mutations.   Given the initial characteristic integers of N minions, all of which are then transmogrified, find out how many of them become Wolverine-like.   Input Format: The first line contains one integer, T, which is the number of test cases. Each test case is then described in two lines. The first line contains two integers N and K, as described in the statement. The next line contains N integers, which denote the initial characteristic values for the minions.  Output Format: For each testcase, output one integer in a new line, which is the number of Wolverine-like minions after the transmogrification.  Constraints:  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ N ≤ 100 1 ≤ K ≤ 100 All initial characteristic values lie between 1 and 10^5, both inclusive.   Example  Input: 1 5 10 2 4 1 35 1  Output: 1  Explanation: After transmogrification, the characteristic values become {12,14,11,45,11}, out of which only 14 is divisible by 7. So only the second minion becomes Wolverine-like. 
 Petr is organizing Petr Mitrichev Contest #11. The top N coders according to codechef ratings (excluding Petr himself) agreed to participate in the contest. The participants have been ranked from 0 to N-1 according to their ratings. Petr had asked each participant to choose a coder with rating higher than himself/ herself, whom he/she would like to be team-mates with, and the i^th ranked coder's choice is stored as choice[i]. As expected, programmers turned out to be lazy, and only a few of them actually filled in their choices. If choice[i] = -1, then it means the i^th coder was lazy and did not fill his/her choice. Of course, the top-ranked person (i.e., rank = 0),  Gennady Korotkevich  (obviously), despite clearly not being a lazy person, was not able to fill any choice, because he is the top ranked coder, so choice[0] is always equal to -1.   Petr, being the organizer, had to undertake the arduous task of filling in the choices for the lazy participants. Unfortunately, he also got lazy and adopted the following random strategy:   For each lazy person i (i.e., for all i > 0, such that choice[i] = -1), he flips an unbiased coin (i.e. with 1/2 probability it lands Heads, and with 1/2 probability it lands Tails). Notice that no coin is flipped for i If it lands Heads, he will not change the choice of this person. That is, he leaves choice[i] as -1.   Otherwise, if it lands Tails, he will uniformly at random select one of the top i ranked participants as choice of i^th person. That is, he sets choice[i] = j, where j is randomly and uniformly chosen from 0 to i-1, inclusive.   After this process of filling the choice array, Petr is wondering about the maximum number of teams he can have such that all the valid choices are respected (i.e. if choice[i] = j and j != -1, then i and j should be in the same team). Petr now has to arrange for computers. As each team will need a computer, he wants to know the expected value of maximum number of teams. As he is too busy in organizing this contest, can you please help him?   Input: The first line of input contains T, the number of test cases. Each test case contains 2 lines. The first line contains a single integer N. The second line contains N integers, which specify the choice array: choice[0], choice[1],..,choice[N-1].  Output: Each test case's output must be in a new line and must be 1 number which is the expected number of teams. Your answer should be within an absolute error of 10^-6 from the correct answer.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000 The sum of all the T Ns in one test file ≤ 5000 -1 ≤ choice[i] ≤ i-1 , for all 0 ≤ i < N choice[0] will be equal to -1, always   Example Input: 1 5 -1 -1 1 2 1  Output: 1.5  Explanation: choice[2] = 1 implies 1 and 2 should be in the same team. choice[3] = 2 implies that 2 and 3 have to be in the same team. Therefore, 1, 2 and 3 have to be in the same team. Also, choice[4] = 1 implies that 1 and 4 have to be in the same team, which means that 1, 2, 3 and 4 — all have to be in the same team. The only lazy person is 1. So with probability 1/2, Petr leaves his choice unchanged, or with the remaining 1/2 probability, he assigns choice[1] = 0, as 0 is the only higher ranked person for 1. In the first case, you can get 2 teams: {0} and {1, 2, 3 ,4}. In the second case, because choice[1] = 0, 0 and 1 are forced to be in the same team, and hence {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} is the only possible team. Therefore, with 1/2 probability, number of teams = 1 and with another 1/2 probability, it is 2. Hence, expected number of teams = (1/2 * 1) + (1/2 * 2) = 1.5. 
 Uncle Ben is a very kind man and is revered by the whole neighborhood. One halloween night a group of trick-or-treaters come by Ben's house. Uncle Ben has some treats with him but he sees that the children do not have equal number of treats. He feels that it would be unfair to give away the treats to just any of the kids. So he decides to line up all the kids and distribute the treats according to the number of treats that the respective child has, so that he may equalize the number of treats to the best extent. What is the maximum number of children that have equal number of treats. It is not necessary that Uncle Ben give all his treats.  Input  First line has two integers N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100000), number of children and K  (1 ≤ N ≤ 10^7), number of treats Uncle Ben has. The second line contains N integers sepearated by single space, c1, c2, .... ,cn (1 ≤ ci ≤ 10^6)  where ci is the number of treats i^th children has.  Output  Output  maximum number of children that have equal number of treats.  Example  Input: 4 5 5 5 3 1  Output: 3  Explanation: Uncle Ben gives two treats to 3rd child. So 3 children have five treats each. There is no way that more than 3 children can have equal treats.

Pakistan Team is obsessed with match fixing. Their bookie Asif is writing a letter to them and wants nobody else to be able to read it. They use a simple substitution cipher to encode his message. Each letter in the message is replaced with its corresponding letter in a substitution alphabet. A substitution alphabet is a permutation of all the letters in the original alphabet. In this problem, the alphabet will consist of only lowercase letters ('a'-'z'). For example, if  message is "hello" and his cipher maps 'h' to 'q', 'e' to 'w', 'l' to 'e' and 'o' to 'r', the encoded message will be "qweer". Given the original message, determine the cipher that will produce the encoded string that comes earliest alphabetically. Return this encoded string.    Input The first line consists of a number t representing the number of test case. Then, t lines follow each containing the message that will be less than 10,000 characters. It will contain only lowercase letters ('a'-'z').   Output Output the Cipher message for each message.   Example  Input: 2 hello sachin   Output: abccd abcdef

  Arush was not always poor at Mathematics but his recent performances had not been that good and he had lost his confidence. Now his elder brother was determined to bring back his confidence back in Mathematics. So he made a tricky question and made sure that Arush would be able to do solve it. The factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n! , is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ...... * 1  Arush’s elder brother so defined a function F(x) for positive integer x as the product of factorials of its constituting digits. For example, F(125) = 1! * 2! * 5!. You are given a number N that contains d digits and contains at least one digit larger than 1. The problem is to find maximum positive number M which should contain neither the digit 0 nor the digit 1 and also F(M) = F(N). The number N may possibly start with leading zeroes.

  After getting bored of the monotonous routine of college, Chahak wants go back to the golden days of her life ‘Her Childhood’ when she used to enjoy playing games and one such game is "Stapu" (Hopscotch). Chahak wants to play the game differently now. She plays the game on marble floor consisting of N parallelly placed rectangular tiles. She can jump to next one or jump over one or two tiles at a time. There are some tiles considered ‘unlucky’ and number of such tiles is known to her. She doesn’t want to step on them as she fears to lose the game. She will win only if she completes the game starting from first tile and ending at the last one. Help Chahak to find out if she can jump through all the tiles and win the game without stepping on the unlucky tiles.    Input  The first line contains T, number of test cases.

We know that there are so many calendar systems. For example, Bangla, Christ, Arabic, Chinese etc. This problem is about Decimal calendar. There are 3 months in this calendar. First month is "Hundreds". There are 300 days in this month. Second month is "Tens". There are 60 days in this month. And this followed by the last month "Ones" having 5 or 6 days depending on whether this is leap year or not. A Decimal year spans a full Christ calendar. That is 1st Hundreds in Decimal Calendar is 1st January in Christi Calendar. Similarly, 31st December of Christ Calendar is 5th or 6th day of Decimal calendar (depending on whether it is leap year or not).  A year in Decimal calendar is leap year if the corresponding Christ year is leap year. For example, the Decimal year corresponding to 2000 Christ year is leap year but 2001 is not, and again 1900 is not leap year too. A year in Christ calendar is leap year if the year is divisible by 400 or divisible by 4 but not by 100.  You are given a day in Christ calendar in DD-MMM-YYYY format (DD stands for day, MMM stands for first three letters (in CAPS) of the month and YYYY stands for the year). You are to give the date in Decimal Calendar format.   Input First line contains number of test case. Every test case consists of a date in Christ Calendar format in each line.   Output You are to output the case number and the date in Decimal Calendar format. Output the date and the month in the Decimal Calendar.   Example  Input: 3 01-JAN-1900 10-JAN-1900 16-DEC-1900  Output: Case 1: 1 Hundreds Case 2: 10 Hundreds Case 3: 50 Tens  Note First three letters for the months are: JAN, FEB, MAR, APR, MAY, JUN, JUL, AUG, SEP, OCT, NOV, DEC. 
Long ago during the Jurassic Park age, there was a company TopHunters, which used to conduct hunting competitions for the Dinosaurs around the world. Petrosaurus was believed to be the greatest hunter of that time and all other dinosaurs enjoyed watching the hunting videos posted by him in the forums ( yes, they had a website :) ). Many Indian dinosaurs used to post in sms language in the forums and annoy others. Vexosaurus was so annoyed reading the posts with numbers used in place of letters. He decided to correct all those posts, before the forums get Rusty. Could you please code for him and replace the following words in 1st column with their corresponding words in 2nd column     8ate w8wait gr8great 4for b4before           Lets not make this complex and just replace the words when they appear entirely as a word themselves, and not as a subpart of bigger words ( see examples for clarity ). A word is a continuous sequence of non-space characters. Disclaimer : This is just a fictional story. Any resemblance to real persons or company or dinosaurs is purely coincidental ;)   Input First line contains T [ number of test cases, around 50 ]. Each of the next T lines contains a sentence with not more than 100 characters [ 'a' - 'z' , '0' - '9' , space ]. There can be 2 or more continuous spaces and you have to preserve them, in the output. Input sentence will not begin or end with a space.   Output For each test case, output the corrected sentence, in a new line.   Example  Input: 3 i 8 food b4 gr8 2 see you w8ing 1234   5678   9  Output: i ate food before great 2 see you w8ing 1234   5678   9 
Alice and Bob are playing a game of moving coin on a N x N grid of 0s and 1s. Rows are numbered 1 to N from top to bottom and Columns are numbered 1 to N from left to right. Starting from a cell in the 1st row, they take turns alternately each time moving the coin to the next row. From a cell (i,j) they can move the coin to any of the cells (i+1,j-1), (i+1,j), (i+1,j+1) as long as it lies inside the grid. The game halts when the coin reaches the last row. Alice wants to collect as many 1s as possible along the path, while Bob wants to collect as many 0s as possible. The game starts with Alice placing the coin in a cell in the 1st row, then Bob moving it from the 1st row to the 2nd row and then Alice moving it to the 3rd row and so on. In how many cells in the 1st row can Alice place the coin initially, such that the number of 1s encountered along the path from top to bottom is at least K, if both play optimally. Note that such a path covers exactly N cells, including a cell in the 1st Row.  Input The first line contains the number of test cases T. T cases follow. Each test case consists of N K in the first line followed by the description of the grid in the next N lines. Each row of the grid is given as a string of 0s and 1s, without spaces in between. A blank line precedes each test case.  Output Output T lines, one for each case containing the required answer.

Rohit just started his 3rd semester classes in DMS. One of the interesting parts of DMS is set theory. He has just learnt about Power Set of any set, which is the number of ways in which you can create a unique subset from the existing set. Two subsets are said to be different if atleast one element in both the subsets are different. Given the number of elements in the set, you need to print out the size of power set that can be obtained from the main set. Since the answer can be pretty huge, you need to print the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each of the T lines that follow have the number N denoting the number of elements in the main set.  Output For each test case, print out the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.  Constraints  1 <= T <= 1000 0 <= N <= 10^15   Example Input: 2 1 3  Output: 2 8  Explanation Example case 2. For N = 3, if main set is { 1, 2, 3 }, the subsets are : { }, { 1 }, { 2 }, { 3 }, { 1,2 }, { 1,3 }, { 2,3 }, { 1,2,3 }.

  A guy named Cman attends the final grade of a high school. One day Cman decided to watch a match of his favorite football team. And, as the boy loves football very much, even more than linear algebra, he forgot to do the homework. Specifically, he forgot to complete his linear algebra tasks. Next day the teacher got very angry at Cman and decided to teach him a lesson. He gave the lazy student a seemingly easy task: You are given an idle body in space and the forces that affect it. The body can be considered as a material point with coordinates (0, 0, 0). Cman had only to answer whether it is in equilibrium. According to the teacher a body is considered to be in equilibrium if and only if the coordinates of the resulting vectors are prime numbers. So, Cman began to solve the problem. But later it turned out that there can be lots and lots of these forces, and Cman can not cope without your help. Help him. Write a program that determines whether a body is idle or is moving by the given vectors of forces. Note : The resulting vector acting on a body is the vector having x, y and z coordinate as sum of all x[i], y[i] and z[i] respectively.    Input First line of input will contain a single integer “T” representing number of test cases. First line of each test case will contain a single integer “N” denoting number of force vectors acting on the idle body. Next N lines will contain three space separated integer i.e. x[i] coordinate, y[i] coordinate and z[i] coordinate of force vector i..  Output For each test output the word "YES" if the body is in equilibrium, or the word "NO" if it is not  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000 0 ≤ x[i] ≤ 100 0 ≤ y[i] ≤ 100 0 ≤ z[i] ≤ 100     Example Input: 2 3 2 1 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 3 5 7 11 3 7 5 3 5 3  Output: NO YES     Explanation Example case 1.When we sum up the force vector i.e. sum up x[i], y[i] and z[i] we got 11, 14, 18 i.e. (2+4+3, 1+5+8, 3+6+9) so the y and z coordinate of the resulting vector are not prime so the body is not in equilibrium state. Hence, we print NO for first test-case. 
 Reversed number is a number written in arabic numerals but the order of digits is reversed.  The first digit becomes last and vice versa. For example, if the number is 1245,it will become  5421 .Note that all the leading zeros are omitted. That means if the number ends with a zero,  the zero is lost by reversing (e.g. 1200 gives 21). Also note that the reversed number never has  any trailing zeros. Your task is to add two reversed numbers and output their reversed sum. Of  course, the result is not unique because any particular number is a reversed form of several  numbers (e.g. 21 could be 12, 120 or 1200 before reversing). Thus we must assume that no zeros  were lost by reversing (e.g. assume that the original number was 12).    Input  The input consists of N cases (equal to about 10000). The first line of the input contains  only positive integer N. Then follow the cases. Each case consists of exactly one line with  two positive integers separated by space. These are the reversed numbers you are to add.     Output  For each case, print exactly one line containing only one integer - the reversed sum of  two reversed numbers. Omit any leading zeros in the output.    Example  Input: 1 24 1  Output: 34   
 A positive integer is called a palindrome if its representation in the  decimal system is the same when read from left to right and from right  to left. For a given positive integer K of not more than 5 digits,  write the value of the smallest palindrome larger than K to output.  Numbers are always displayed without leading zeros.   Input    The first line contains integer t, the number of test cases.  Integers K are given in the next t lines.     Output   For each K, output the smallest palindrome larger than K.

 Ramesh is contemplating putting a new flooring throughout his house, but he has an important constraint: no tiles must be cut in the process of tiling any room. The floor of every room must be completely tiled, and all tiles in a particular room must be orientated the same way. This will make it easier for him to count tiles in any room that he is in because he won't have to estimate, and subsequently, add fractions of tiles into the total. Of course Willard is quite happy to put different tiles in each room to make counting them more interesting. Fortunately, the dimensions of every room in Ramesh's house are integral(interger) number units on each side and every room is a perfect rectangle. As well, Willard has found a tile manufacture that offers a variety of tile sizes, all of which, by coincidence are also an integral(integer) number of units on each side. Of course, the tiles are rectangular. The manufacture, who offers the different sizes for aesthetic reasons, and not to satisfy the somewhat compulsive behaviors of the likes of Willard, is somewhat taken aback b y Ramesh's request that the manufacture guarantee that a particular size of tile will exactly cover a room (i.e., the whole floor is covered and no tile is cut).However, the manufacturer is business minded and asks you to write a simple computer program. This program will help them match tile sizes up for each room in Ramesh's house and thereby meet his request.   Input  The first line contains the number of test cases. Following lines represent a single room in the house and a possible tile to be used in that room. Each line contains 4 integer values. The first two values are the dimensions of a room and the last two values are that of a tile. No room is larger than 250 X 250, no tile is larger than 50 X 50 and Ramesh's house has no more rooms than 100.   Output  Each line represents the answer for a particular room(the first line for the first room, the second line for the second room etc.). If the room can be exactly tiled with the tiles of the given dimension then the line would consist of the word "yes" else "no".   Example  Input: 1 50 70 2 3  Output: no  
  So, you are bored and you think about playing a game. The game is like, if you win your money will be doubled and eleven dollars extra will be added to it. If you lose, your money will be halved (if the amount is odd, it will be halved to the upper integer). The inital amount of money you have is 'X'. A sequence of W and L are given as input, and 'X' is given initially. You have to find the amount of money remaining with you at the end of the game.    Input  The first line contains a single integer X denoting the amount of money you initially have.  The second line contains a sequence of characters of W and L representing Win and Loss respsectively.    Output output a single line containing the amount you have at the end of the game.    Constraints  Length of sequence ≤ 1000     Example Input #1: 51 L  Output #1: 26  Input #2: 23 LWLW  Output #2: 47     Explanation Example case 1. The game is a loss. So, the amount of money is to be halved.

The WiFis can be installed at locations 1,4 and 8 or 1,4 and 9 resulting in a minimum distance of 3. 
  Sheh ! You are bored again. :P You guys decide to play a game, this time based on your names. All of you write your name on a sheet of paper and the one whose name has the maximum number of distinct substrings of his name wins the game. But counting this is a tiresome task, isn't it ? So, you think about writing a clever piece of code for doing this and finding out the winner amongst you. The winner takes it all. You are given a string and you have to find the number of distinct substrings of that string.    Input The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T lines follow. Each line is a string of length <=100   Output For each test case, output the number of distinct substrings on a single line.  Constraints Length of strings<=100  Example Input: 2 CCCCC ABABA  Output: 5 9    Explanation Example case 2. Explanation for the testcase with string ABABA: len=1 : A,B len=2 : AB,BA len=3 : ABA,BAB len=4 : ABAB,BABA len=5 : ABABA Thus, total number of distinct substrings is 9. 
  In the country of Numberia, there is a city called Primeland. Sherry is one of the rich inhabitants of the city, who likes to collect coins of various denominations. Coins in primeland are little strange , they are only available in prime denominations (i.e as coins of value 2,3,5 etc.).Sherry is taking a tour of the country but as he visits people ask him for change, unfortunately Sherry took coins of only two kinds of denominations(the coins are of Primeland), he has already made a lot of such changes but then he wonders what is the maximum amount which he can't give change for using the coins he has.Remember he has coins of only two different denominations and has infinite number of them..    Input First line of input will contain number of testcases,T.Following T lines will contain two integers c and d separated by a space denoting the denominations which sherry has while he is on the tour, both c and d are guaranteed to be prime.    Output For each of the T testcases output one number per line the maximum amount which sherry can't afford to give change for.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 2 ≤ c,d ≤ 10^6     Example Input: 2 3 5 2 3  Output: 7 1    Explanation For Test Case 1 : We see that 2 cannot be paid using coins of value 3 and 5. In fact we can pay the following series of numbers using coins of value 3 and 5. 3,5,6,8,9,10.....and so on. Clearly we cannot make change for 1,2,4,7. Out of these numbers 7 is maximum therefore 7 is the correct answer. Basically find the list of numbers for which change can't be made using the two coins given in the input and print the maximum of those numbers as your answer.

Rohan and Digits Rohan is very fond of digits (0-9). He has a maths project at school and was asked to bring something cool. So he thought of cutting out digits in a piece of chart paper and coloring them with different colors.While he was doing this, he noticed that, for digit 0, he had one hole in the chart paper. A hole can be of any shape. So, 0,4,6,9 all has one hole. 8 has two holes. Rest of the digits don't have holes. Rohan was thinking of writing some computer program to enhance his programming skill. But he needs to verify his solution. Help him. Now, as a programmer what you have to do is pretty simple. Given a specific number of holes x, you have to print the smallest integer having x holes in it. Note that this number should not have any leading zeros.  INPUT The first line contains an integer x, which represents number of holes  CONTRAINTS :   0 <= x <= 510   OUTPUT : For each test case, print the smallest integer containing exactly x holes in it. Note: Output can be very very long.  SAMPLE TESTS: INPUT-1:  0  OUTPUT-1: 1 INPUT-2:  1  OUTPUT-2: 0 INPUT-3:  5  OUTPUT-3: 488  Explaination for sample test case 3 : 4 has one hole, 8 has two holes. So total holes = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. 
Nikhil loves to play FlappyBirds (who doesn't!). He plays it on his brother Nitin's mobile since he doesn't own one. One day, as usual, Nikhil comes to ask Nitin if he can play the game. Nitin challenges Nikhil to write code for a puzzle he's been trying to solve for last three days. If Nikhil solve's it, he can play. But alas! Nikhil is not an expert programmer like you. He needs your help. Help Nikhil play FlappyBirds! The puzzle is simple. You have a 4 x 4 grid. Some of the cells in the grid are black and some white. 'b' represents black and 'a' represents white. Eg.             babb            bbbb            aaaa            aabb  The task is to change the color of at-most one cell to the other color (ie. a -> b, b -> a) so that you can form a 2 x 2 grid, with all cells of the same color.  INPUT  Input has four lines, containing four characters each. If the j-th character of the i-th line is 'b', that cell is black, and so on.  OUTPUT Print "POSSIBLE" (without the quotes) if it's possible to complete the task and "NOT POSSIBLE" (without the quotes) otherwise.   Sample Test: Sample Test 1 Input    bbbb  abaa  bbbb  aaaa  Sample Test 1 Output POSSIBLE Sample Test 2 Input    bbbb  aaaa  bbbb  aaaa  Sample Test 2 Output NOT POSSIBLE  Explanation for Sample Test 1 : If we re-paint the 1st cell at 2nd row, we can get a 2 x 2 grid of all cells 'b'. 
 Lazy Puzzle Aashish was sitting in a park with Chirag. Aashish wanted to prove Chirag about his puzzle solving skills and asks Chirag to give him a puzzle.

Cersei And Her Energy Game Cersei Lannister likes to play difficult games but this Energy Game is little too difficult for her ,so you have to help her out. There is a one-dimensional road. The road is separated into N consecutive parts. The parts are numbered 0 through N-1, in order. Cersei is going to walk from part 0 to part N-1. Cersei also noticed that each part of the road has a color: either red, green, or blue. Part 0 is red. Cersei is going to perform a sequence of steps. Each step must lead in the positive direction. That is, if her current part is i, the next step will take her to one of the parts i+1 through N-1, inclusive. Her steps can be arbitrarily long. However, longer steps are harder: a step of length j costs j*j energy. Additionally, Cersei wants to step on colors in a specific order: red, green, blue, red, green, blue, ... That is, she starts on the red part 0, makes a step to a green part, from there to a blue part, and so on, always repeating red, green, and blue in a cycle. Note that the final part N-1 also has some color and thus Cersei must reach it in a corresponding step.  INPUT: First line consist of 't' number of test cases. The next  't' lines, each line has a string representing the road (each string has 'N' elements) . For each i, element i of string is the color of part i: 'R' represents red, 'G' green, and 'B' blue.  CONSTRAINTS: Following holds for each string in input:  string will contain between 2 and 15 characters, inclusive. each character of string will be either 'R' or 'G' or 'B'. The first character of string will be 'R'.  1<= t <=30   OUTPUT: If Cersei can reach part N-1 in the way described above, print the smallest possible total cost of doing so. Otherwise, print -1.  SAMPLE TEST CASES: Input:  6 RGGGB RGBRGBRGB RBBGGGRR RBRRBGGGBBBBR RG RBRGBGBGGBGRGGG Output:  8 8 -1 50 1 52

Also the number on the left depicts a particular character in the ASCII chart i.e the number 109 10 means that 109 is a decimal number(base 10) and it is equivalent to the character 'm' in ASCII chart  Similarly the number 401 5 means that 401 is a number in base 5 (equal to 101 in decimal) and is equivalent to 'e' in ASCII chart.  thus the above sequence of numbers are decoded into the string 'method'  Keen to know more information you decide to create a program that will decode the numbers obtained into the character string.    Input Line 1 number of characters N you want to decode Next N lines containing the number and its radix by a space   Output the decoded string   Example  Input: 6 109 10 401 5 164 8 10212 3 216 7 121 9  Output: method

Aman loves solving English puzzles. His teacher taught him a new topic today called Contiguous Words. A contiguous word is a word in which all the occurrences of each letter of the word is together (i.e. no same letter should be separated by one or more other letters). For example, "aaabb" and "abc" are contiguous word. "bitotsav" is not a contiguous word since the 't's don't occur together. For the weekends the teacher gave Aman a homework on contiguous word. The homework is as follows: The teacher divided contiguous word into several parts. Aman has to form the original contiguous word and print it. If more than one contiguous word can be formed print "MORE THAN ONE". If a contiguous word cannot be formed from the given parts print "NOT POSSIBLE" (all quotes for clarity). Input Specification  First line will contain the no. of test cases T. Each test case contains two lines of input. The first line contains the no. of parts K. The second line contains K strings separated by a single space, denoting parts.   Output Specification  If only one contiguous word can be formed print the word. If many such words can be formed print "MORE THAN ONE". If no such contiguous word can be formed print "NOT POSSIBLE".   Constraints  1<=T<=300 1<=K<=50 Each part will contain between 1 to 20 characters, inclusive. Each character of the parts will contain only lowercase letters (a-z).   Sample Input   4 3 zzzz zz z 2 ro ar 3 ro a r 2 ac cca   Sample Output   zzzzzzz arro MORE THAN ONE NOT POSSIBLE  
The chef has just finished baking several pies, and it's time to place them on cooling racks. The chef has exactly as many cooling racks as pies.  Each cooling rack can only hold one pie, and each pie may only be held by one cooling rack, but the chef isn't confident that the cooling racks can support the weight of the pies. The chef knows the weight of each pie, and has assigned each cooling rack a maximum weight limit. What is the maximum number of pies the chef can cool on the racks?  Input: Input begins with an integer T≤30, the number of test cases. Each test case consists of 3 lines. The first line of each test case contains a positive integer N≤30, the number of pies (and also the number of racks). The second and third lines each contain exactly positive N integers not exceeding 100. The integers on the second line are the weights of the pies, and the integers on the third line are the weight limits of the cooling racks.  Output: For each test case, output on a line the maximum number of pies the chef can place on the racks.  Sample input: 2 3 10 30 20 30 10 20 5 9 7 16 4 8 8 3 14 10 10   Sample output: 3 4  
Bala's room is in a mess. He's been so busy doing research that he hasn't bothered to clean out his room for months. Now he has decided to sort out all the items in his room and keep only the essential ones. He knows the usefulness of each of the 'N' items that he has, and wants to keep only the 'K' most useful items. Bala is also very forgetful, so he wants a procedure that doesn't require him to remember too many things at once.   Input The first line of input contains 'T', the number of test cases (1 ≤ T ≤ 100). This is followed by T test cases. Each test case begins with a blank line followed by one line containing two numbers 'N' (number of items), and 'K' (number of essential items) (1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 100000000). This is followed by one line containing the usefulness of all the 'N' items, seperated by spaces.    Output The output should consist of 'T' lines corresponding to the 'T' test cases. Each line should contain one number, which is the sum of the usefulness of the 'K' most useful items.   Example  Input: 2  5 2 10 23 47 3 17  10 4 87 45 99 27 58 100 38 50 31 62   Output: 70 348

Input First line contains T, the number of test cases. Each test case consists of N and K in single line.   Output For each test case print the required answer in one line.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ N ≤ 15 0 ≤ K ≤ N   Example Input: 2 2 1 3 1  Output: 2 2   Explanation Example case 1. All permutations are valid. Example case 2. Permutations [1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 1] are counted.  
A sea contains a number of continents. From a sea, we have randomly picked up an area of Dimensions  M * N. Each continent is represend by  1 or group of 1's (joined either horizontally or vertically) in this area. And  0's  represent the water that surrounds those continents. Each unit of this area can contain either 0 or 1 representing continent/part of continent or water surrounding the continent respectively. For this given area of Dimension  M*N Find the Number of continents present in it. Note: A group of 1's joined either horizontally or vertically is considered as a single continent.   Input The first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases are follow.  The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers  M, N described in the statement. Then it follows  M lines each of which contains N space seperated elements(either 0 or 1).  Output For each test case output a line consisting a single integer denoting the number of continents present in the given sea.  Constraints  1 <=T <=10^3 1 <=M,N <=300   Sub tasks   Example case 1. The elements present at location ((0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(1,1),(2,1),(2,2) form a single continent. The element at location (1,2) is another continent. Hence, No Of Continents = 2. Example case 2. The element at location (0,0) is a continent. The element at location (1,1) is a continent. The rest of the 1's except at (0,0) and (1,1) form a single continent. Hence, No of Continents = 3. 
Given two times when seen on a digital clock, count the number of moments between these two times (both start and end time included) when the time was a palindrome. A digital clock shows time in the format HH:MM:SS (hours:minutes:seconds). For example, 2:40:38 pm is represented as 14:40:38.   Input The first line contains q queries. This is followed by q lines each containing two time strings, t1 and t2, which are 6 digit integers that represent times shown by a digital clock. It is ensured that t1 and t2 are valid times.   Output  Each output on a new line.     Constraints  1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5 t1 and t2 are of the form HH:MM:SS t1 occurs on or before t2     Example Input: 4 00:00:01 00:00:01 09:09:09 13:34:57 11:11:11 11:11:11 02:38:15 03:01:16  Output: 0 22 1 3    Explanation Case 1: Only 1 moment is considered in this case, i.e., 00:00:01. We can clearly see that 00:00:01 is not a palindromic string. Case 4: Between 02:38:15 and 03:01:16, there are 3 moments that are palindromic strings. They are 02:44:20, 02:55:20 and 03:00:30.   Note that the time as seen on a digital clock should appear as a palindrome. 1 is a palindrome, but 00:00:01 on a digital clock is not.

Aman has a hardware store in Una. One day when he went down to the store room to fetch a box of nails. He found that the price tag had faded out. The first and the last digits of the price were not readable. Although, the number of nails in the box could be read clearly. The box read, 72 nails, Rs. _679_  What were the two faded digits, and what was the price of one nail?  Aman’s friend Arnab has great knowledge of computer programming. So Aman approached him.  He wants him write a program that solves the general version of the above problem:  N nails, Rs. _XYZ_  The total number of nails, N, is between 1 and 99, including both. The total price originally consisted of five digits, but we can see only the three digits in the middle. We assume that the first digit is nonzero, that the price of one nail is an integer number of rupees, and that all the nails cost the same price. Given N, X, Y, and Z, write a program that guesses the two faded digits and the original price. In case that there is more than one candidate for the original price, the output should be the most expensive one. That is, the program is to report the two faded digits and the maximum price per nail for the nails    Input The input consists of T test cases. The number of test cases ( T ) is given on the first line of the input file. The first line of each test case contains an integer N (0 < N < 100), which represents the number of nails. In the following line, there are the three decimal digits X, Y, and Z, separated by a space, of the original price $_XYZ_.  Output For each test case, your program has to do the following. For a test case, there may be more than one candidate for the original price or there is none. In the latter case your program is to report 0. therwise, if there is more than one candidate for the original price, the program is to report the two faded digits and the maximum price per turkey for the turkeys. The following shows sample input and output for three test cases.   Example  Input: 3 72 6 7 9 5 2 3 7 78 0 0 5   Output: 3 2 511 9 5 18475 0

 Congratulations!!! You have been selected as a contestant on the show, Programmer's Jackpot tonight. For one of the rounds in the show, you face a problem as defined below :  "For any positive integer 'X' , the sum of digits called as digit-sum of 'X', is defined as the sum of 'X' itself and its digits. When 'Y' is the digitsum of 'X' , we call 'X' a encore of 'Y'. For example, the digit-sum of 245 is 256 (= 245 + 2 + 4 + 5). Therefore, 245 is a encore of 256. But there are some numbers which do not have any encores, and some numbers have more than one encore. For example, the encores of 216 are 198 and 207."  Your task for this round is to write a program to find the smallest encore of the given integer.   Input  Your first line of input consists of 'K' (1 ≤ K ≤ 50) test cases. The number of test cases 'K' is given in the first line of the input followed by a blank line. Each test case takes one line containing an integer N , (20 ≤ N ≤ 100,000).   Output  The output of your program will print exactly one line for each test case. The line is to contain a encore of N for each test case. If X has multiple encores, print the smallest. If X does not have any encores, print "NONE". The following shows sample input and output for three test cases.   Sample Input: 3  216 121 2005  Sample Output: 198 NONE 1979 
 Everyone knows that electricity travels faster than anything. But we can delay an electric signal if we can make it pass through a grid of dense and resistive wires. So, this is your objective in this problem. You are given a square grid consisting of numbers. The numbers in the grid are the seconds by which an electric signal can be delayed if it is made to pass through that particular block in the grid (Be careful...Some blocks can actually increase the speed of the grid!!). You can reflect the electric signal from one block to only 3 other blocks as follows:1. to the block immediately below.2. to the block diagonally below left. (i.e. one down and one left)3. to the block diagonally below right. (i.e. one down and one right) What you need to do is to find the maximum delay that can be introduced in the electric signal. The constraints are that the signal can start at any block belonging only to the top row. And can end at any block only at the bottom row.   Input  The first line contains the number of test-cases followed by a blank line. The test cases won't exceed 50 neither would be less than 1. The first line of each input begins with the dimension of the grid. From the next line, the actual grid is provided as an input, the blocks in a row separated by a space and the new row on the new-line. There is a blank line between two consecutive inputs. Consider all the inputs as Integers (in accordance with the "int" in C language on a 32-bit system).   Output  The delays introduced in the electric signal for each input should be printed on a new-line.   Sample Input: 1  3 2 3 1 4 5 6 -1 -2 5  Sample Output: 14

 Two employees of a multinational company plan a conspiracy against the management . The major problem in their plans to take place is regular and secret communication. One of them comes up with a common but insecure method of encrypting text .What he does is to permute the letters of the alphabet. In other words, each letter of the alphabet is consistently replaced in the text by some other letter. To ensure that the encryption is reversible, no two letters are replaced by the same letter.You have been appointed by management to decrypt several encoded lines of text, assuming that each line uses a different set of replacements, and that all words in the decrypted text are from a dictionary of known words.   Input  The first line of the input consists of the number of test cases (within 1 and 50) followed by a blank line. The test case consists of a line containing an integer 'n', followed by 'n' UPPERCASE words, one per line, in alphabetical order. These 'n' words compose the dictionary of words which may appear in the decrypted text. Following the dictionary is the input text. There are no more than 1,000 words in the dictionary. No word exceeds 16 letters. The encrypted lines contain only UPPERCASE letters and spaces and do not exceed 80 characters in length. Finally every test case is separated by a blank line.   Output  Decrypt each line and print it to standard output. If there are multiple solutions, any one will do. If there is no solution, replace every letter of the alphabet by an asterisk.

 Crick and Watson was the duo who discovered the Double Helix model of the DNA with its "AT GC" pairing. Now while they were working on their project, they came across an intriguiging problem. The problem was that they found many combinations of the "AT"s and "GC"s in the DNA of the same organism. To their relief, this list was exhaustive. And now, they are stuck with the problem to construct the complete DNA of the organism from the combinations that they found. The problem is that, the combinations that they found ARE be a proper subset of the master DNA Model. So now, your job is to help the legendary duo in constructing the master DNA of the organism from the given combinations. The constraint being that the length of the master DNA model should be minimum.   Input  The first line of the input would consist of the number of test cases (within 1 and 20) followed by a blank line. The first line of each test case would consist of the number of "ATGC" Combination strings (not exceeding 20 and atleast 2) followed by the combination strings on each newline. Finally, there is a blank line between each two consecutive test cases. Consider that all the string input is in UPPERCASE. The input is in the priority order i.e. the importance order of the combination strings. Consider the order of importance of the combination string input ONLY if you get two master DNA strings of the same length.    Output  For the output, the master DNA model for each test case is expected on a newline. The output is also expected in UPPERCASE only.   Sample Input: 1  3 TAGCAT CATGGC GGTAG  Sample Output: GGTAGCATGGC 
   The Network Treasure Hunt (NTH) is an online treasure hunt. There are hundreds of participants, decrypting messages and taking the help of clues to solve riddles. Participants can go to the next level only after solving the question on their current level. The NTH team had logs of participants who solved a level and moved to the next level, ordered by increasing time of submission from the start of the contest. The NTH Team decided to pick winners for every level. The first person who reached a level was the winner of that level. Given the chronological ordering of correct answers, find the winners of each level.    Input First line contains an integer N, representing the number of entries in the logs. N lines follow. Each line contains a string, representing the username of a player who has moved one level up. Note: The list is sorted by the time at which the users submitted a right answer.  Output  Print the username of winners of each level, in increasing order of level number. Each line should contain an integer representing the level followed by a string representing the username of the winner of that level. The level number and username should be separated by a space  Constraints 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ Length of username of participant ≤ 50     Example Input: 6 Ankit Akshay Ankit Tarun Akshay Akshay  Output: 1 Ankit 2 Ankit 3 Akshay

  There is a mountain on Planet Credenz which can be represented by a 2D matrix X of size MxN. Each element of the matrix represents the altitude (height) of the mountain at that location. The mountain has an active volcano which can erupt at any time. The volcano will erupt from a location ( i , j ) which will be specified in the input. The Lava will then flow from that position to other positions such that Lava will flow from a higher altitude to a lower (or equal) altitude towards its 8 neighbors. In case there is no way for the lava to flow, it will accumulate within it’s boundaries and it will overflow to neighboring positions as soon as its height becomes greater than or equal to the height of any of the neighbors on the boundary. If lava reaches the boundaries of the mountain, it will stop accumulating and will flow out of the mountain.  Note that lava will not accumulate unless and until it has a path to flow or it can flow out of the mountain. Also, while accumulating the altitude of the lava at each position where it is present will be equal. For better understanding of these conditions, consider the flow of lava as the flow of a real world fluid/liquid. For example if the mountain matrix is like:   12 12 12 12  8 12 12 10 12  and the lava originates from the position ( 2 ,  2 ) with altitude 8 then the lava cannot flow to any neighbor as there is no neighbor which has a lower altitude than or equal to 8. Thus lava will go on accumulating within the boundary and fill up until it reaches an altitude of 10 and then flow out to the location ( 3 , 2 ). This is an edge location and thus the the lava will flow out of the mountain from here. Your task is to find out which locations of the mountain will be covered with lava. Output a matrix A of size ( M * N ) where :  Aij = 1 if the location ( i , j ) is covered with lava. Aij = 0 if the location ( i , j ) is not covered with lava.    Input First line contains two space separated integers, M and N. M lines follow, each containing N spaced integers representing the altitude of each part of the mountain. Next line contains two space separated integers i and j denoting the position of eruption of volcano. (The matrix is 1-indexed)    Output Output M lines, each containing N spaced integers, that is the matrix A.    Constraints 1 ≤ M, N ≤ 200 1 ≤ i ≤ M 1 ≤ j ≤ N 1 ≤ Xij ≤ 10^6    Example Input: 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 3 5 6 6 6 3 3 5 5 6 6 3 4 4 6 5 6 5 6 6 6 5 6 5 6 6 6 2 3  Output: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0   
I guess the most visited site of the past 3 months is www.cricinfo.com. First World Cup Cricket, then Australia tour to Bangladesh and now IPL T20. I believe there are lots of cricket fans among you. So I do not need to describe the game rule. But for the purpose of this problem here is short description of scoring. Any rule out of this problem description is not applicable for this problem. For this problem we will use only the following outcomes in a ball:   .cricinfotable td {    border: 1px solid #000;    padding:3px; }   Possible Outcome in a Ball Runs Is the Ball valid?   . (dot) 0 Yes   1 1 Yes   2 2 Yes   3 3 Yes   4 4 Yes   6 6 Yes   Wd 1 No   1Wd 2 No   2Wd 3 No   4Wd 5 No   Nb 1 No   1Nb 2 No   4Nb 5 No   6Nb 7 No   W 0 Yes    (Wd stands for Wide, Nb for No Ball and W for Wicket)  In cricinfo we always watch the score card. In cricket an over consists of 6 valid balls. A score card of an over may look like below:   1 . W . Wd Nb . 6   In this over there were 1 wicket and 9 runs. In the last over of second innings of a match, a team requires N runs to win. You are to output number of ways of the outcome of the over. Note that, as you are watching second innings of the match, so it may be possible that he can score N runs in first 4 balls and win the match. That means, it is not necessary to play an entire over to score N runs. Also suppose you do not know how many wickets are already gone. So it may also be possible that after a few wicket falls they are all out. Also note that, if a team scores greater or equal to N runs the team wins and does not play any ball.  Input First line contains number of test case T (T <= 10000). For each test a line contains N (1 <= N <= 10000).  Output For every test case, output the case number and number of ways of outcome of the last over where the team needs N runs to win. As the answer can be very big, so output in mod 10000007.  Example  Input: 1 1  Output: Case 1: 946 
It was Valentine's last week and as usual Sunny was alone without a girlfriend. Sad isn't it? He proposed to Isha though. Isha was a maths freak and she wanted her boyfriend to be a maths geek as well!  So she planned something. She has given him a mathematical problem to solve. For a given value of N and K he needs to find  Modulo 10000000000283. Sunny truly loves Isha and so he has been trying to solve the problem from past few days even though he is very weak in maths since childhood! Can you help Sunny so that she accepts him as her boyfriend? Note: totient(x) is defined as the count of those numbers below “x” which are co-prime to “x”. Assume that totient(1)=1.   Input First line contains T, the number of test cases. Each of the next T lines consists of two integers N and K.    Output Output T lines each containing a single integer which represents  Modulo 10000000000283.   Constraints  1<=N<=10^7 1<=K<=1000 1<=T<=1000  Example  Input: 3 2 2 10 2 5 3  Output: 3 44 124 
Sak and Pre are the two little sisters :) They love to play games with each other. Yesterday, Pre was stumbling online and she came across a new game called “Stone-Queen”. She immediately told about it to Sak, so she could play it with her. Stone-Queen is a two player game. The game starts with a pile of stones. Each player on his turn can subtract a “queen” number of stones from the pile and the subtracted stones are discarded from the game. A queen number is defined as a number which is either a prime or it has exactly two distinct prime factors. The loser is the player who cannot make a move. Sak is very intelligent, she figured out the winning strategy after a number of plays. But Pre is not able to figure out the winning strategy and so she is losing every time. Can you help Pre find out who wins the game given the initial number of stones N in the pile? Assume that both players play optimally    Input First line contains T, the number of test cases. Next T lines contains T test cases, each of which is in the form of first_player N”, where first_player stands for the player who starts the game and N represents the number of stones in pile initially.    Output Output T lines, each containing the name of player who wins the game.   Constraints 1 ≤ N ≤ 100000 1 ≤ T ≤ 10000    Example  Input: 3 Sak 3 Pre 1 Pre 4   Output: Sak Sak Pre  
 Turtur has started preparation for All Champions Mathematics Contest going to be held in Feb. this year. Although he is very good at mathematics, but his weakest among all topics is Number Theory. So he has been studying various Number Theory problems from past few days. He came across one of the problems called Excessivity of a number problem. Excessivity of a number is defined as the product of Summation excess function of every prime below or equal to that number. Summation excess function for a prime number is defined as sum of Excess function of all positive powers till power K of that prime number. Excess function of a number is defined as the sum of all divisors of that number (including 1 and itself) minus that number itself.  Excess(x) = sum of divisors of "x" – x. SummationExcess(P,K) = Excessivity(N,K) =  Turtur has found a very nice solution for this problem for some values of N & K. But since he is weak in Number Theory, he is unsure of his results and he wants to crosscheck his answers for given values of N & K. Since this result can be pretty large, just tell him the Excessivity(N,K) modulo 10^9+7.    Input First line consists of T the number of test cases. Each of the next T lines contains two integers N and K.    Output Output T lines each containing the Excessivity(N,K) modulo 10^9+7.   Constraints  1<=N<=10^6 1<=K<=10^9 1<=T<=10  Example  Input: 2 2 3 5 2  Output: 11 140 
City of Romini is one of the well planned cities of the world. Why? Because road network at Romini is great. The roads in Romini are built in a grid like fashion. Some roads in Romini have stall-walls from which people cannot pass through. One such arrangement of Romini grid road network is given in a figure below   The above network has 5 east to west roads and 3 north to south roads. “#” represents stall-walls. Stall-walls are only present at the intersection point of any two roads.  Nooji is spending her holiday in City of Romini. She was amazed by the transport system of Romini. They have a very weird rule of charging fare from commuters. For a travelling distance of any units in either a horizontal direction or a vertical direction, without a stall-wall in between source and destination, they charge 1 Rupa. So suppose Nooji wants to travel from S to D2 in above grid network system, she will only have to pay 1 Rupa. But if she wants to travel between S and D1, she will be charged 3 Rupa because she cannot commute through stall-wall and so she will have to go south first one unit (and pay 1 Rupa for it), then travel 3 units east (and pay 1 Rupa for it) and then finally travel 1 unit north to reach D1 (and pay 1 Rupa for it). So in total she will have to pay 3 Rupa.  She is so confused with this system! Being a travel planner for her, can you plan her travel between given source and destination so that she has to pay minimum?    Note  If Nooji cannot reach destination from source, print 0 as answer.   Input First line contains T, the no. of test cases. Each test case starts with two integers M and N in the first line, the dimensions of grid road network. Next line contains the integer coordinates of source for Nooji. Next line contains integer coordinates of destination for Nooji. Next M lines contain N characters in each line, the description of Grid road network. Note that all coordinates are 0 indexed based.   Output Output T lines each containing the minimum amount Nooji will have to pay for travelling.   Constraints  N<=100 M<=100 T<=100  Example  Input: 2 4 4 1 1 2 2 .... ..#. .#.. .... 3 5 1 2 0 4 ..##. ...#. .....   Output: 4 3 
 Silly is the chief of the secret department that works on Encryption techniques. YooTi works under Silly in that department. Silly is working on a new project. The project often requires the Exclusive-OR maximum to be found out on a set of integers with respect to another given integer called the query integer. So every time a query integer comes up to Silly, he asks YooTi to find out the Max (Ai xor B) where Ai is an integer from the set A and B is the query integer. YooTi is frustrated now because Silly gives too many query integers and she has to search out the whole set to find the answer. Can you help YooTi with this?   Input  First line contains N, the number of integers the set A. Next line contains N space separated positive integers. The value of each integer will not exceed 1000000. Next line contains Q, the number of query integers. Next Q lines contain the query integers B, one per line.    Output Output  Q lines 'corresponding to each query containing a single integer, the max(B xor A1, B xor A2,.......,B xor An).  Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 100000 1 ≤ Q ≤ 10000 1 ≤ Ai ,B ≤ 1000000    Example  Input: 5 5 8 12 20 18 4 1 10 20 16  Output: 21 30 28 28

 Bruce the miner works as a slave in a diamond mine, and now the mine is starting to fall apart. After helping his friends evacuate the mine, he thinks it is the perfect time to make some profit and escape from his oppressive masters.  His plan is to re-enter the mine with the excuse of helping more people, take as much diamonds as he can and exit the mine before it falls apart without being seen. Then, he will escape far away and live peacefully in a Caribbean island with all his diamonds. However, the mine will fall apart in L minutes, so he needs help in determining the maximum number of diamonds he can take and return to the entrance before the mine falls apart.  The mine is structured as N chambers connected by N-1 corridors. Each corridor connects two different chambers and takes a specific number of minutes to be traversed. Also, it is known that there is exactly one path between each pair of chambers in the mine. The chamber 0 represents the entrance to the mine. Miner Bruce can take as much diamonds as he wants from the chamber where he is instantly.  Input  The first line contains an integer T, which specifies the number of test cases. Then, T test case descriptions will follow.  Each test case will start with a line with two positive integers, N and L, whose meanings were described previously. The next line will contain N integers Di, specifying the number of diamonds on each chamber. The next N - 1 lines will contain three integers Ai, Bi and Ci each, which indicates that the chambers Ai and Bi are connected by a corridor that takes Ci minutes to be traversed.  Output  For each input case you must print the string "Case #i: ", where i is the test case number, starting from 1, followed by the maximum number that Bruce the miner can recover without being trapped inside the mine.   Example  Input 2 5 7 7 3 7 8 6 0 1 1 0 2 1 0 3 1 0 4 1 6 25 5 8 3 3 10 7 0 1 4 3 0 3 2 3 2 5 2 3 4 5 4  Output Case #1: 28 Case #2: 28   Constraints   1 ≤ T ≤100  2 ≤ N ≤100  1 ≤ L ≤200 Ci will be between 1 and 100, inclusive, for each i between 1 and N-1, inclusive. Di will be between 0 and 1000, inclusive, for each i between 1 and N, inclusive Ai will be between 0 and N-1, inclusive, for each i between 1 and N-1, inclusive. Bi will be between 0 and N-1, inclusive, for each i between 1 and N-1, inclusive. There will be exactly one path between each pair of different chambers.

Problem text... Many persons are familiar with the Roman numerals for relatively small numbers. The symbols i, v, x, l and c represent the decimal values 1, 5, 10, 50 and 100 respectively. To represent other values, these symbols, and multiples where necessary, are concatenated, with the smaller valued symbols written further to the right. For example, the number 3 is represented as "iii", and the value 73 is represented as "lxxiii". The exceptions to this rule occur for numbers having units values of 4 to 9, and for tens values of 40 or 90. For these cases, the Roman numerals representations are "iv" (4), "ix" (9), "xl" (40) and "xc" (90). So the Roman numeral representations for 24,39,44,49 and 94 are xxiv, xxxix, xliv, xlix and xciv respectively. The preface of many books have pages numbered with Roman numerals, starting with "i" for the first page of the preface, and continuing in sequence. Assume books with pages having 100 or fewer pages of preface. How many i, v, x, l and c characters are required to number the pages in the preface? For example, in a five page preface we'll use the Roman numerals i, ii, iii, iv and v, meaning we need 7 i characters and 2 v characters.  Input Input description... The input will consists of a sequence of integers in the range 1 to 100, terminated by a zero. For each integer, excepts the final zero, determine the number of different types of characters needed to number the prefix pages with Roman numerals  Output Output description... For each integer in the input, write one line containing the five counts in the order i, v, x, l, c.  Example  Input: 2 20 99 0  Output: 3 0 0 0 0 28 10 14 0 0 140 50 150 50 10  
For the purposes of this problem, we will assume that every page in an book is numbered sequentially, and that the first page is numbered 1. How many digits would you need to use to number the pages of a 10 page book? Pages 1 to 9 would require 1 digit each (total 9), and page 10 would require 2 digits. This makes 11 digits. Similarly, a book of 34 pages would require 59 digits. Can we work backwards? If you are told that a book requires 13 digits to number its pages, can you work out how many pages the book has? I hope so, because that is all you have to do for this problem. Each line in the input file represents the number of digits used in numbering a book. Your answer will be the number of pages the book has. If the number supplied cannot possibly be valid, your answer should be "Impossible!" Beware that books can be quite large, and the number of digits required for a given book can reach 2,000,000,000.    Input Each line in the input file contains a single integer, between 1 and 2,000,000,000, representing a number of digits used in numbering the pages of a book. A single # on a line indicates the end of input.   Output Output for each input number must be on a single line. If the input value is valid, output the number of pages in the book. Otherwise, output "Impossible!"   Example  Input: 11 13 59 60 1999999998 #   Output: 10 11 34 Impossible! 234567900

  Now a days it is possible to access particular website without typing it's full name. This helps in reducing the typing time. So in this you are given a website name as input and you have to cut short it's name and print the shoretd length of the website. The shortened version of the website name will be such that a user   won't have to type 'www.' to open a website anymore. You don't need to type vowels Though, you still need to type '.com' to open a website. Obviously, this means you can type the name of a website faster and save some time.     Input The first line contains T, the number of test cases. The second line contains the name of websites, as a string.  Output You have to print the ratio of characters you would have typed in shortest form to it's full form. Constraints: 1 <= T <= 100 1 <= Length of the website <= 200   Example Input: 2 www.google.com www.yahoo.com  Output: 7/14 6/13 
Shinchan is new to COUNTER STRIKE and he cannot differentiate between players of Terrorist and Counter Terrorist. Since he is new to COUNTER STRIKE so he used to kill his team members as he couldn't recognize them. Everyone got frustrated with him. One day he came up with a formula to recognize players by their user names.  This is his method: if the number of distinct characters in one's user name is odd, then he is a Counter Terrorist, otherwise he is a Terrorist. You are given the string that denotes the user name, please help Shinchan to recognize the players by his method.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Next T lines will contains a non-empty string, that contains only lowercase English letters(i.e. 'a' to 'z') — the user name.  Output  For each test case, output a single line containing "Terrorist" or "Counter Terrorist".     Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 400 1 ≤ length of user name ≤ 10^5     Example Input: 4 ace shars blizzard sak  Output: Counter Terrorist Terrorist Counter Terrorist Counter Terrorist    Explanation Example case 1. There are 3 different characters {a, c, e} which is Odd. Therefore, player is Counter Terrorist. Example case 2. There are 4 different characters {a, h, r, s} which is Even. Therefore, player is Terrorist.

  The chef wants to play chess and is trained by his coach. The chef knows all the rules of playing chess. To test the chef, coach gives him an assignment. Coach arranges 8 Queens on a chess board and asks chef to check and tell him whether any of the 8 queens is threatening any of the 7 other Queens. The chef is facing difficulty to find out. Your job is to help chef find whether all Queens are safe at their places and finally say whether the arrangement is valid or not. A chess board is an 8 x 8 matrix of squares and Queens may move any direction along a row, column or diagonal.     Input The first line consist of T, which denotes the number of test cases. Following T lines consist of 8 space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., A8 which denote 8 columns of the Queens on the rows of a chess board, with 1 being the first column and 8 being the last, e.g. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 means the Queens are along the diagonal.    Output Print "Yes" if all the Queens are safe, otherwise print "No" (without quotes) for every test case Tips:  If there are T test cases, the output will contain T lines, with each line containing either Yes or No     Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ Ai ≤ 8     Example Input: 3 1 8 2 5 3 7 4 6 3 5 2 8 1 7 4 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  Output: No Yes No    Explanation Example case 1. Here Queen A4 with position (4,5) can kill Queen A6 with position (6,7) diagonally. Same is the case with Queen A5 and Queen A8. Hence this arrangement is not valid. Example case 2. Here all the Queens are safe, hence this arrangement is valid. Example case 2. Here all the Queens are arranged diagonally, hence this arrangement is valid. 
  In ancient India, a mathematician, Virahanka described a sequence of numbers, called "Virahanka Sequence". The sequence consisted of numbers like -  1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55,...In this sequence, each number is the sum of two consecutive numbers occurring exactly before it. The Chef has also learned mathematics. He is asked to count the number of trailing zeros Z, i.e. the total number of zeros at the end of the number (Eg : 154000 has 3 trailing zeros) in the factorial of a Virahanka number. Your job is to help Chef find the number of trailing zeros in the n^th Virahanka number.    Input The first line contains a number N denoting the total number of test cases. Following N lines will have numbers n. Tips:   Each n may or may not be different     Output Output will contain N lines each containing Z, i.e. the total number of zeros in the end of the factorial of n^th Virahanka Number. Tips:  The output will contain N lines and each line will contain a single number.     Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6^ 1 ≤ n ≤ 38     Example Input: 3 2 5 7  Output: 0 1 2     Explanation Test case 1. The 2^nd Virahanka Number in Virahanka sequence is 1, and the factorial of 1 is 1. There is no zero at the end of 1. Hence, output is 0. Test case 2. The 5^th Virahanka Number in Virahanka sequence is 5, and the factorial of 5 is  120 = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1. There is 1 zero at the end of 120 hence, output is 1. Test case 3. The 7^th Virahanka Number in Virahanka sequence is 13, and the factorial of 13 is 6227020800 = 13 * 12 * 11 *...* 2 * 1. There are 2 zeros at the end of 6227020800. Hence, output is 2. 
  In a morning assembly line in Hogwarts, N students of house Slytherin stood in an unordered line in a random manner (in terms of their heights)  with each student having unique positive height. There is a boy named "Longbottom" who is very mischievious. Professor McGonagall assigned Harry a task to keep an eye on "Longbottom". All students were then arranged in the increasing order of their heights, with the shortest ones first and longest ones at the last. For example, if the heigths of the students in unordered assembly line was {1, 3, 5, 2, 4} after arranging them in increasing order, it becomes {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Before arranging students, "Longbottom" was on K^th position (indexing starts from 1) in the unordered assembly line. Harry lost his view on "Longbottom", while students were being arranged. Your job is to tell Harry, what is the position of "Longbottom" in the ordered assembly line.    Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains one integer N denoting the number of students in the assembly line of house Slytherin. The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the heights of students standing in the unordered assembly line of Slytherin. The third line contains the only integer K, indicating the position of "Longbottom" in the initial unordered assembly line.    Output For each test case, output a single line containing an integer, denoting the position of "Longbottom" in the final assembly line.    Constraints 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000 1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 100 1 ≤ Ai ≤ 10^9    Example Input: 3 4 1 3 4 2 2 5 1 2 3 9 4 5 5 1 2 3 9 4 1  Output: 3 4 1    Explanation In the example test there are T = 3 test cases. Test case 1. In the first test case N equals to 4, K equals to 2, A equals to {1, 3, 4, 2}. The answer is 3, because {1, 3, 4, 2} ->(after arranging according to height of students) {1, 2, 3, 4}. A2 now is on the 3^rd position. Test case 2. In the second test case N equals to 5, K equals to 5, A equals to {1, 2, 3, 9, 4}. The answer is 4, because {1, 2, 3, 9, 4} ->(after arranging according to height of students) {1, 2, 3, 4, 9}. A5 now is on the 4^th position. Test case 2. In the third test case N equals to 5, K equals to 1, A equals to {1, 2, 3, 9, 4}. The answer is 1, because {1, 2, 3, 9, 4} ->(after arranging according to height of students) {1, 2, 3, 4, 9}. A1 now is on the 1^st position. 
  A town in Death Valley has a water tank that contains 100,000 litres of water. Water is consumed by the town at the rate of X litres per week. If it is assumed that there is no rain, your job is to find the total number of weeks water will last. Do not include the last week if the water remaining for that week is less than the weekly usage amount.     Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. Each test case contains a single number X denoting the usage of water by town in litres/week.    Output For each test case, output a single line with format - "X litres will last for Y weeks", where X is water usage and Y is the number of weeks water will last.    Constraints 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ X ≤ 10^5    Example Input: 3 3960 1024 8425  Output: 3960 litres will last for 25 weeks 1024 litres will last for 97 weeks 8425 litres will last for 11 weeks     Explanation In the example test there are T = 3 test cases. Test case 1. In the first test case, X = 3960. At the rate of 3960 Litres/week, after 25 weeks only 1000 litres of water will be left, which is not sufficient for a week. Hence, no more week, the water can last and the remaining 1000 litres are ignored. Finally Y = 25. Test case 2. In the second test case, X = 1024. At the rate of 1024 Litres/week, after 97 weeks only 672 litres of water will be left, which is not sufficient for a week. Hence, no more week, the water can last and the remaining 672 litres are ignored. Finally Y = 97. Test case 3. In the third test case, X = 8425. At the rate of 8425 Litres/week, after 11 weeks only 7325 litres of water will be left, which is not sufficient for a week. Hence, no more week, the water can last and the remaining 7325 litres are ignored. Finally Y = 11. 
Here's a challenge that's a bit more mathematical in nature. Write a program that determines the number of trailing zeros at the end of X! (X factorial), where X is an arbitrary number. For instance, 5! is 120, so it has one trailing zero. (How can you handle extremely values, such as 100!?)    Example  Input:  An integer e.g 5!  Output:  No of trailing zeros in answer, 5! Is 120 so it has one trailing zero  
While Tom Cruise(Cage) fighting in the movie "Edge of Tomorrow", he finds himself in a modern lab, where he needs to kill the brain of a mutant species Omega. The DNA of the Omega is made up of characters of A, T, G and C like ours. He has certain enzymes which will cut and remove certain parts of this DNA. The mutant being an intelligent species, is able to reform its DNA, even after a piece of DNA is removed.  You will be given a DNA sequence, and few enzymes. Suppose, a DNA sequence goes like this : ATGCTGCTATGCATGCAGTGACT, and you are given enzymes which can remove AT and GC sequences. Thereby, you need to remove all occurrences of AT from the DNA first and then reform the DNA and apply the next enzyme to remove all occurrences of GC. The output of the problem would be the string you get at last reforming the pieces which are not removed by these enzymes. Input The first line of input consists of an integer n that denotes the number of enzymes. The second line has the DNA sequence. The next n lines has the input B1, B2, B3... Bn. Output For given input DNA sequence, output a single line containing the final reformed DNA that is formed by repeatedly removing all the occurrences of B1, B2, B3... Bn from A. In case the DNA is completely consumed print 0 to indicate that there is no DNA left.  Constraints  1 <= n <= 10  Example  Input: 2 ATACGCATGACGATGCATGCAGCAT ATA GC   Output: CATGACGATATAAT  Input: 3 ATGCATGCATCGACTCAGCATCAGCATCGACTA TG GC AT  Output: ACACCGACTCACACGACTA 
 With her new hair-style, Penny has to listen to all the comments of Sheldon Cooper. She (God knows why) challenged Sheldon Cooper for a match of Chess. Penny wants to defeat Dr. Sheldon Cooper in the game of chess. Although, she tried very hard, she is in a situation and wants your help. It is your duty to help Penny. The situation goes like this. Penny has only "King" left with her, while Sheldon has a King, a Queen, a Rook and a Bishop. You are given a situation of a chess board as input. Sheldon has given Penny a CHECK, you need to tell Penny, whether this is the end of the game or she still has a chance. In case, she still has a choice, ensure she is safe in the next step too.  P.S. All rules of chess apply here. The death of a King is considered as end of the game. You can also refer to  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess for the rules. Input A description of the 8X8 chessboard grid is given. Empty boxes are shown as "_", Penny's King is shown by P, Sheldon's king is shown by S, and the queen, rook and bishop are shown by Q, R and B respectively. Output Print CHECKMATE! if its a checkmate, else print NOT YET!. Consider each and every possible ways, and remember ALL rules of Chess applies here. Example  Input: ____B___ ________ __Q_____ ________ ____P_S_ _R______ ________ ________  Output: NOT YET!  Input:  ________ ________ ___S____ ______B_ Q__P___ _R______ ________ ________  Output: CHECKMATE! Explanation Example case 1. Penny can still move her King to either one step Up or one step to left. So, this isn't a checkmate. 
  Ayan's favourite musical instrument is the keyboard. He practices regularly as well, you can hear him playing even at 3 or 4 in the night. Unfortunately, he got into a fight in his room and his keyboard was damaged beyond repair. However, being a rich fellow he quickly ordered another one. But this time he felt a bit adventurous. He decided to buy a circular keyboard i.e keys are arranged in a circle. This funky keyboard has only 12 keys though - C,C#,D,D#,E,F,F#,G,G#,A,B and S. Since the layout is quite different to what he is used to, he needs to relearn basics of music theory again. Firstly, a semitone is the distance between any two keys. So there are 3 semitones between D and F, and 2 semitones between S and C# (remember it is circular!) He knows a chord is an unordered set of three or more than three keys. However, Ayan wants to start slow and considers only triads - chords of size 3. Triads come in two varieties - major and minor. In a major triad the number of semitones between the first and second key is 4, and between the second and third - 3. Minor triads on the other hand have 3 semitones between the first and second keys, 4 semitones between the second and third one. For example, D F# A is a major triad, while D F A is minor. Ayan needs your help classifying some basic triads. Kindly help him.   Input  The first line of input is the number of test cases T (1<=T<=25).  The next T lines contain three characters corresponding to the musical keys on the circular keyboard.  Note that # keys will be given as small letters and normal keys as capital letters. So C# will be given as c, while D will remain D.  It is guaranteed that the triads will be either major or minor.  Output  For each test case, print "Major" or "Minor" in a separate line, depending on whether the given triad is major or minor. Example  Input:  2 E G S S d f    Output: Minor Major   Explanation Example case 1. E and G have a 3 semitone gap, while G and S have a 4 semitone gap. So Minor.  S and D# have a 4 semitone gap (remember circular) and D# and F# have a 3 semitone gap. So Major.  
  Problem 1 Antidote. Two students from Amrita named Dos and Dex are trying to do a research on human ageing. Dos prepares an Antidote to stop skin from aging. Dex prepares an antidote for stopping hair fall. Dos and Dex combined their experiments and came out with a single antidote, which stops the human ageing. A Researcher now wants to preserve their antidote in Amrita Research Storage Refrigerators (ARSR). But ARSR can only store N liters in a container. Prepared antidote is with research lab assistant, when asked; she fills the beaker with the antidote and gives antidote. Now researcher wants exactly N liters of antidote and researcher is left with two unused faded beaker with capacity A and B litres. Researcher now needs your help to find whether they can exactly measure N liters from their unused beaker. Allowed Operation to any beaker 1. 1) Fill the beaker fully, by asking lab assistant. 2. 2) Empty it entirely. 3. 3) Transfer as much antidote from Beaker 1 to Beaker 2, till Beaker 1 gets empty or Beaker 2 is completely filled. *Beakers measuring marks are completely faded.     Input Test Case (T <= 20). A B N in a separate line (1<= A, B, N 1<= 10^7).   Output “YES”, If Researcher can fill one of beaker with n liters and give to the ARSR or else “NO”.   Example Input: 2  5 4 3  6 2 13   etc.  Output: YES  NO  etc.    Explanation Test­case 1 : Fill beaker 4 and pour it to beaker 5. Again fill beaker 4 and pour it to beaker 5. beaker 4 will contain 3 litres of antidote. Test­case 2: we cannot have 13 litres of antidote in any beaker  ... 
  You have a N x M matrix of cells. The cell (i, j) represents the cell at row i and column j. You can go from one cell (i, j) only down or right, that is to cells (i + 1, j) or (i, j + 1). But K cells are blocked in the matrix(you can’t visit a blocked cell). You are given coordinates of all these cells. You have to count number of ways to reach cell (N, M) if you begin at cell (1, 1). Two ways are same if and only if path taken is exactly same in both ways.   Input First line consists of T, denoting the number of test cases. Each test case consists of N, M and K in single line. Each of the next K lines contains two space separated integers (xi, yi), denoting the blocked cell’s coordinates.    Output For each test case print the required answer modulo 10^9+7 in one line.    Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ N, M ≤ 10^5 0 ≤ K ≤ 10^3 1 ≤ xi ≤ N 1 ≤ yi ≤ M     Example Input: 2 3 2 0 2 3 1 1 2   Output: 3 1    Explanation Example test case 1. No cell is blocked. 3 distinct paths are: (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (3,2). (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (3,2). (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (3,2). Example test case 2. Only one valid path (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (2,3). 
A cyclist, bored of congested roads, decides that she no longer wants to go the shortest route from her hostel to the college. She has decided that it is safer to follow routes with bicycle lanes. Roads have cycle lanes in both directions - however, they have gaps in their cycle-lane coverage. For this question, you are given a network of roads. With each road, there is a score, of the percentage of its length supporting a bicycle lane. You can assume that the percentages are unique floating-point values. The "safety-factor" of a path from hostel to college is the least score of a road on that path. You have to compute the path from hostel to college, with the largest safety-factor.  Input The input consists of several lines. The first line is a number saying how many networks are present in the input. This is followed by lines describing each network. The first line of each network has a single number (let’s call it v) -- the number of vertices in the network. This is followed by a number of lines, each describing a road. Each road is  given as three numbers separated by spaces - the first two being the nodes connected by the edge, and the third a floating-point number representing the percentage of cycle-lane coverage (between 0 and 100, inclusive). The end of the list of roads for a network is denoted by three "-1"s in a line. The college is always assumed to be node 1 and the hostel is always assumed to be the node with the highest index. There is at most one road between any pair of vertices. There is certainly at least one path that connects the hostel and the college.  Output The output should have several lines. The i-th line describes the safety factor of the i-th network in the input. The output should be within 10^-6 of the answer.  Sample Input  2 4 1 2 4.0 1 3 7.0 1 4 1.0 2 3 5.0 2 4 3.0 3 4 2.0 -1 -1 -1 4 1 2 40.0 1 3 8.0 1 4 11.0 2 3 21.0 3 4 30.0 -1 -1 -1   Sample Output  3 21  
  Since the finance department of MAKAUT has lots of bills to pass and funds to allocate for puja and freshers so there is a mess in Finance Officer's office. Although he has numbered all type of files from 0-9, all his files got jumbled up. Aaroti Di however arranged all of them to form a big integer n and presented it to Finance Office's office. But Finance officer wants to know how many files of a particular type q is there. Help Aaroti Di to find out the count of a particular type.   Input  First line contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases. Next 2t lines follow. Where first line shows the integer n of that test case and second line has the integer q, the file type queried for.   Output Print the total number of files of the queried type in a new line.

Keyboard typing is the main source of our input to the computer. We use keyboard for textual inputs. But to err is human. Suppose that in typing a document the user makes a mistake. He types a letter to the right of the actual character letter on the keyboard. Write a program to take the user string as input and display the actual correct string. Note: Apply the required constraint.   Example  Input: Sdfghj Output: Asdfgh  
Magic matrix is a square matrix of odd number of rows and columns. The noticeable thing in this is that the sum of all the numbers either row wise, column wise or diagonally equals to the same digit and each number can be used just once in this matrix. Write a program to develop a magic matrix of resultant sum 57.   Example   Output: 22  15  20 17  19  21 18  23  16   
GUI matters greatly to the user but another major concern is the security of the information. There are a lot of ways to implement security of data. Of these one method is the replacement cipher text generation method. In this each character is replaced by a particular other character and the text is modified. Write a program to display a text box on the screen and every input character given by the user should be displayed as ‘*’ mark. The program should meet the following constraint The working of enter, backspace should be as usual. After pressing enter, the password is encrypted using replacement cipher text generating and saved in the file named “pass.txt”. *********   Example  Input abcdefghi  Output: bcdefghij 
Obtaining the mirror image of a string or a number has been few basic examples we did in our childhood. Lets extend this to the a new level. Write a program to obtain the mirror image of a 2D string array about two perpendicular lines passing from the mid point divides the lines into two equal halves. Note: Apply the required constraint.   Example  Input  Abcde Bcdef Cdefg   Output: Fgecd Efdbc Decab  
The reverse and add function starts with a number, reverses its digits, and adds the reverse to the original. If the sum is not a palindrome (meaning it does not give the same number read from left to right and right to left), we repeat this procedure until it does. For example, if we start with 195 as the initial number, we get 9,339 as the resulting palindrome after the fourth addition: 195 786 1,473 5,214 591 687 3,741 4,125 + —– +—— + —— +—— 786 1,473 5,214 9,339 This method leads to palindromes in a few steps for almost all of the integers. But there are interesting exceptions. 196 is the first number for which no palindrome has been found. It has never been proven, however, that no such palindrome exists. You must write a program that takes a given number and gives the resulting palindrome (if one exists) and the number of iterations/additions it took to find it. You may assume that all the numbers used as test data will terminate in an answer with less than 1,000 iterations (additions), and yield a palindrome that is not greater than 4,294,967,295.    Input The first line will contain an integer N (0 < N ≤ 100), giving the number of test cases, while the next N lines each contain a single integer P whose palindrome you are to compute. 
  These days a lot of new coders are emerging at RJIT. One of the  many programmers in RJIT thought of making a program to find the weekday for any given date. He successfully builds it but there is one problem, his program prints the day of yesterday's date. Now he wonders whether he can find the next date given him the output date.    Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T lines follow, each containing the present date in following format dd/mm/yyyy.   Output  You need to output a single line for each test case printing the next date in following format dd/mm/yyyy or d/m/yyyy according to the case if it exists or else print "Invalid Date"(without quotes).     Constraints  2 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ dd ≤ 35 1 ≤ mm ≤ 15 1000 ≤ yyyy ≤ 3000     Example Input: 3 16/09/2014 17/09/2014 5/02/2004  Output: 17/9/2014 18/9/2014 6/2/2004   
 Problem description.  up with a new method for the registration process. For this, an arena has been built in the form of an N x M matrix. A student starts the registration process at the cell in the top left corner, and the process completes at the cell in the bottom right corner. All other cells have an intermediate registration stage which take up some time t. A student can advance from the current cell to either the cell to the right, or to the cell to the bottom of the matrix. You want to minimise the time required for the registration process, since you prefer to have it completed before lunch time.

NoOne recently became head of auckDunia. auckDunia has N cities. auckDunia is connected by M roads such that you can visit from any city to another and each road has some cost which had to paid to use that road. To travel between city A and city B people have to pay money corresponding to the roads that they used to travel. Now, people don't want to waste money. They want to reach from city A and city B by paying as less as they can. This way there will be many roads which won't be used by anyone so maintaining them doesn't make much sense. NoOne wants to destroy these roads.  As you are elected to handle this stuff, help him to know which all roads needs to be destroyed.  Note: There can be multiple roads between two cities.  Note1: If there are two roads between two cities having same weight, a person may choose any of the road.    Input: First line of input contains a single integer T denoting the no. of test cases. First line of each test case consists of two space separated integers N and M denoting the no. of cities and no. of roads. Next M lines of each test case consists of 3 space separated integers X, Y and W denoting that there is a bidirectional road between city X and city Y having cost W.    Output: For each test output the result as follows: First line contains a single integer denoting the no. of roads which can be destroyed. Suppose this integer is A then in next A lines print a single integer denoting the index of the road to be destroyed. Indices need to be printed in increasing order. Consider 0-based indexing    Sample Input: 2 3 3 0 1 10 1 2 3 2 0 3 3 3 0 1 10 1 2 3 2 1 3   Sample Output: 1 0 0  Sample Explanation: In first case you can destroy 0th road and in 2nd case you can't destroy a single road. A person can choose road 1 2 or 2 1. As we are not sure which road will be used so we won't destroy any road.   Constraints: 1 <= T <= 10 1 <= N <= 100 1 <= M <= 10000 1 <= W[i] <= 1000000

 Problem description. Utkarsh found an array A of size N. He needs to report the number of pairs (i,j) where i < j such that LCM (A[i], A[j]) > min (A[i], A[j])  CONSTRAINTS  1 <= N <= 10^6 1 <= A[i] <= 10^6   INPUT First line contains N. Next line contains N integers of A.  OUTPUT output a single integer, the answer to the problem  EXAMPLE  INPUT 4 1 1 2 3  OUTPUT 5 
 Problem Description Utkarsh is on his way to Q shrines on the X axis. The ith Shrine is present at X=Li. For each shrine, Utkarsh will start at X=0 and move forward with the help of an array A of size N which will help him to reach the shrines. To move forward he must choose an index 1<=i<=N which allows him to jump A[i] units forward in the positive X axis. Utkarsh hates forgetting the past so he has an initially empty stack S to help him remember which indices of the array he chose. More specifically whenever he chooses index i of A, he pushes i at the top of the stack S. Utkarsh will only be able to enter the ith shrine if he is at X=Li and  |S|>0 . However, the converse is not true, i.e., Utkarsh may choose to not enter the shrine even if the above conditions are satisfied. Since Utkarsh is getting thinner nowadays, he would be able to carry stacks of size at most K. Utkarsh wonders how many different stacks can he have when he enters the ith shrine. (Two stacks are considered different iff they have different sizes or they contain different index value at some position) Output the answer modulo 10^9+7 for each shrine. Output 0 if he cannot enter the ith shrine.   INPUT First line contains N and K. Next line contains the array A. Next line contains Q. Next line contains all the Li.

Devu has an array A consisting of N positive integers. He would like to perform following operation on array.  Pick some two elements a, b in the array (a could be same as b, but their corresponding indices in the array should not be same). Remove both the elements a and b and instead add a number x such that x lies between min(a, b) and max(a, b), both inclusive, (i.e. min(a, b) ≤ x ≤ max(a, b)).   Now, as you know after applying the above operation N - 1 times, Devu will end up with a single number in the array. He is wondering whether it is possible to do the operations in such a way that he ends up a number t.   He asks your help in answering Q such queries, each of them will contain an integer t and you have to tell whether it is possible to end up t.   Input There is only one test case per test file. First line of the input contains two space separated integers N, Q denoting number of elements in A and number of queries for which Devu asks your help, respectively Second line contains N space separated integers denoting the content of array A. Each of the next Q lines, will contain a single integer t corresponding to the query.  Output Output Q lines, each containing "Yes" or "No" (both without quotes) corresponding to the answer of corresponding query.  Constraints  1 ≤ N, Q ≤ 10^5 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^9   Example Input 1: 1 2 1 1 2  Output: Yes No  Input 2: 2 4 1 3 1 2 3 4  Output: Yes Yes Yes No  Explanation In the first example, Devu can't apply any operation. So the final element in the array will be 1 itself.  In the second example, Devu can replace 1 and 3 with any of the numbers among 1, 2, 3. Hence final element of the array could be 1, 2 or 3.  
  Dhoni loves prime numbers and prefers his scores to be prime numbers. He played n tournaments last year and m matches in each of them. He prepares a n*m  matrix A[ ][ ]-(one indexed matrix) in which A[i][j] represents the runs scored by Dhoni in jth match of ith tournament and wonders if there is at least one column or row in that matrix that consists of prime numbers only. If the above condition doesn’t satisfy, then Dhoni reserves the special powers of increasing his score of any match by 1  by paying 1 buck.

For any positive integer, we define a digit rotation as either moving the first digit to the end of the number (left digit rotation), or the last digit to the front of the number (right digit rotation). For example, the number 12345 could be left digit rotated to 23451, or right digit rotated to 51234. If there are any leading zeros after digit rotation, they must be removed. So 10203 could be left digit rotated to 2031, then left digit rotated again to 312. Given an integer N, determine the largest integer that can result from performing a series of one or more digit rotations on N.  Input Input will begin with an integer T (at most 1000), the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a positive integer N<100000000 (10^8) on a line by itself.  Output For each test case, print the largest integer that can result from performing one or more digit rotations on N.

Papa Smurf is trying his hands on a new type of dish named IngrediMix. The process of preparation of this dish requires N ingredients (namely a0, a1, a2,... aN-1) to be mixed together in one bowl. Every ingredients has a nutritional value (v0, v1, ..., vN-1) associated with it. The process of creation of dish continues until we have all ingredients mixed in one single bowl. In each step, we follow any one of the following steps a) Select one of the unselected ingredient, ar, and put it in a new bowl. The nutritional value of this bowl will be vr. b) Select one of the unselected ingredient, ar, and put it in a bowl already containing ingredient ar-1 (or ar+1). If the ingredient ar and ar-1 (or ar+1) has additive binding, then the nutritional value of the bowl is increased by vr. If they have multiplicative binding, then the nutritional value of the bowl is increased by the factor of vr. c) Select any two bowls A and B, such that if Bowl A has ingredient ar, then Bowl B must have ingredient ar-1 (or ar+1). Merge Bowl B into Bowl A. If the ingredient ar and ar-1 (or ar+1) has additive binding, then the nutritional value of the bowl A is increased by the nutritional value of bowl B. If they have multiplicative binding relation, then the nutritional value of the bowl A is increased by the factor of nutritional value of bowl B. Papa Smurf wants to mix the ingredients in such a manner such that the final dish has maximum nutritional value. Help him.  Input The first line of input contains a single number, T, number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains an integer N, total number of ingredients. Then in second line, we have N space separated integers (v0, v1,..., vN-1) representing the nutritional value of ingredients. In third line we have a string S containing N-1 characters, representing the binding relation between ingredients. If S[i] = 'a' then, there is an additive binding relation between ingredient ai and ai+1. If S[i] = 'm', then we have a multiplicative binding relation between ingredients ai and ai+1.  Output For each test case, find the maximum nutritional value Papa Smurf can get for his dish. As this number can be very large, print the answer modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7).  Constraints 1 ≤ T ≤ 10 2 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^5  Example  Input: 1 5 1 2 3 4 5 amam  Output: 105   Explanation The following procedure describes the mixing process to be adopted by the Papa Smurf. 1. Ingredient a0 (v0 = 1) is taken in bowl A. Ingredient a1 (v1 = 2) is added to it to yield a mixture having nutritional value 3 since the binding is additive in nature. 2. Ingredient a2 (v2 = 3) is taken in bowl B. Ingredient a3 (v3 = 4) is added to it to yield a mixture having nutritional value 7 since the binding is additive in nature. 3. Now ingredient a4 (v4 = 5) is added to bowl B and the nutritional value of this bowl changes to 35 as a3 and a4 has multiplicative binding relation. 4. Now the mixture in bowl B is added to the mixture in bowl A to get a final mixture, having nutritional value of 105. As bowl B has ingredient a2 and bowl A has ingredient a1, and they have a multiplicative biding, the nutritional values of both bowls are multiplied. 5. Dish preparation process stops as bowl A has all ingredient and it can be easily verified that this is the highest nutritional value possible with the given order of ingredients.

 There are N doors of a palace, all of which are operated by a set of buttons. One day, Alice, who is just 8 years old, gets access to these buttons. Having recently learnt the multiplication tables, she decides to press buttons in a particular order. First, she presses all the buttons that are multiples of 1. Next, she presses all buttons that are multiples of 2, then 3 and so on until N; after which she leaves.  Each press of button toggles the state of the door, i.e. a door that is open will be closed by the button press and opened if closed initially.  Given that all doors were closed initially, give the number of doors that are open after she leaves.   Input  The input contains several lines. First line contains the number 't', which represents the number of test cases that follow. This is followed by 't' lines of numbers which represent 'N'.  0 < t < 1000000 0 < N < 100000000    Output  For each input, output the number of doors that are open at the end.   Example  Input: 4 4 10 16 27  Output: 2 3 4 5  
Problem Statement One of the most popular games played in bitotsav gaming events is DOTA. Ezalor, Keeper of the Light is a great dota hero, but playing this hero needs good codediction and he needs you to help him with this. Ezalor has a powerful spell called illuminate, which attacks all the hero dealing them a lot damage in a straight line. The guy playing this hero has decided to cast illuminate only in direction parallel to axes of the rectangular dota map. Think of dota map as a rectangular gird of rows and columns(1<=R<=40, 1<=C<=40).Each cell in the map consists either an ally or an enemy. The spell of ezalor is 1 unit wide and he can control the length of the spell. Each 'illuminate' spell can be cast only alligned parallel to one of the sides of the map. Ezalor doesnt want to affect the game of other ally heros so he would always make sure that his spell is not casted on the cell of any ally. Ezalor wishes to minimize the number of spells he has to cast, so that every enemy is hit atleast once, an enemy can be hit with the spell more than once. You have to compute the minimum no of spells required. Input Specification  t number of the test cases. Each test case begins with a line containing two space separated intergers R and C, then R lines follows. each line has a string of C characters with '*' recodesenting an enemy and '.' recodesenting an ally.   Output Specification  For each test case output a single line containing an integer recodesenting the number of spells Ezalor needs.   Sample Input  2 3 4 **** *.*. *.** 4 2 *. *. .* .*   Sample Output  4 2  
The palindrome is a string that can be read the same way from left to right and from right to left. For example, strings "aaaaa", "1221", "bbaabb" are palindromes, however the string "chef" is not a palindrome because if we read it from right to left, we will obtain "fehc" that is not the same as "chef".  We call a string a "double string" if it has an even length and the first half of this string is equal to the second half of this string, for example "abab" is a double string because the first half "ab" is equal to the second half "ab", however the string "abba" is not a double string because the first half "ab" is not equal to the second half "ba". The empty string "" is a double string, and its length is 0.  Chef doesn't like palindromes, however he likes "double strings". He often likes to change the order of letters in some palindrome and sometimes to remove some symbols from it. Now he wonders: if a palindrome of length N is given, what is the maximal possible number of characters in a "double string" that can be obtained by removing and changing the order of symbols in it?   Input Several test cases are given. The first line of the sample input contains an integer T - the number of test cases. Then, T lines follow. Each line consists of a single integer N - the length of a palindrome.  Output For each test case output a single integer - answer to the problem.   Constraints 1<=T<=10000 1<=N<=1000000000   Example  Input: 2 2 4  Output: 2 4 
     Children         are taught to add multi-digit numbers from right-to-left one digit at a time.         Many find the "carry" operation - in which 1 is carried from one digit position         to be added to the next - to be a significant challenge.  Your job is to         count the number of carry operations         for each of addition problem so that educators may assess their difficulty.       Input   Each line of input contains two unsigned         integers less than 10 digits.   The last line of input contains 0 0.       Output   For each line of input except the last         output the number of carry operations that would result from adding the two         numbers, in the format shown below.       Sample Input   123 456   555 555   123 594   0 0       Sample Output   No carry operation.   3 carry operations.   1 carry operation.     
 Ali knows how to count, but he is now learning how to             write numbers. As he is a very good student, he already learned 1, 2, 3 and 4.             But he did not realize yet that 4 is different from 1, so he thinks that 4 is             another way to write 1. Besides that, he is having fun with a little game he             created himself: he make numbers (with those four digits) and sum their values.             For instance:   132 = 1 + 3 + 2 = 6   112314 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 9   (Remember that Ali thinks that 4 = 1)       After making a lot of numbers in this way, Ali now             wants to know how much numbers he can create such that their sum is a number n.             For instance, for n=2 he noticed that he can make 5 numbers: 11, 14, 41, 44 and             2 (he knows how to count them up, but he does not know how to write five).             However, he cannot figure it out for n greater that 2. So, he asked you to help             him.       Input:   Input will consist on an arbitrary number of sets.             Each set will consist on an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 1000. You must read             until you reach the end of file.       Output:   For each number read, you must output another number             (on a line alone) stating how much numbers Ali can make such that the sum of             their digits is equal to the given number.       Sample Input   2    4      Sample Output   5    13 
 Have you ever played Minesweeper? It’s a cute little             game which comes within a certain Operating System which name we can’t really             remember. Well, the goal of the game is to find where are all the mines within a             MxN field. To help you, the game shows a number in a square which tells you how             many mines there are adjacent to that square. For instance, suppose the             following 4x4 field with 2 mines (which are represented by an * character):   *…   ….   .*..   ….       If we would represent the same field placing the hint             numbers described above, we would end up with:   *100   2210   1*10   1110       As you may have already notice, each square may have             at most 8 adjacent squares.       Input:   The input will consist of an arbitrary number of             fields. The first line of each field contains two integers n and m (0<n, m<=100)             which stands for the number of lines and columns of the field. Each safe square             is represented by an “.” Character (without the quotes) and each mine is             represented by an “*” character (without the quotes). The first field line where             n=m=0 represents the end of input and should not be processed.       Output:   For each field, you must print the following message             in a line alone:   Field #x:   Where x stands for the number of the field (starting             from 1). The next n lines should contain the field with the “.” Characters             replaced by the number of adjacent mines to that square. There must be an empty             line between field outputs.       Sample Input   4 4   *…   ….   .*..   ….   0 0       Sample Output   Field #1:   *100   2210   1*10   1110 
 A paper cube can be made up from six paper squares.             Given an projection (map) of the cube, you are to determine its correctness. A             projection is correct, if a cube can be made up from it.        Input:   First line contains the number of test cases. Each             test case contains a projection represented as 6*6 grid containing 6 ones and 30             zeros, separated by spaces. 1s represent the paper squares. All squares are             placed immediately to each other, so that each square is connected with at least             one other square. Each test case is separated by an empty line.       Output:   For each test case, your program should print             “correct” if cube can be made up from the given projection, or “incorrect”             otherwise.       Sample Input   1   0 0 0 0 0 0   0 0 0 1 0 0   0 0 0 1 0 0   0 0 1 1 1 0   0 0 0 1 0 0   0 0 0 0 0 0           Sample Output   correct     
 Given a M by N grid of letters, (1<=M,N<=50), and a             list of words, find the location in the grid at which the word can be found. A             word matches a straight, uninterrupted line of letters in the grid. A word can             match the letters in the grid in the grid regardless of case (i.e. upper and             lower case letters are to be treated as the same). The matching can be done in             any of the eight directions either horizontally, vertically or diagonally             through the grid.       Input   The input will contain one or more test cases. The             first line of each test case begins with a pair of integers, M followed by N,             1<=M,N<=50 on a single line. The next M lines contain N letters each; this is             the grid of letters in which the words of the list must be found. The letters in             the grid may be in upper or lower case. Following the grid of letters, another             integer K appears on a line by itself (1<=K<=20). The next K lines of input             contain the list of words to search for, one word per line. These words may             contain upper and lower case letters only (no spaces, hyphens or other             non-alphabetic characters).The input will end with two zeroes for M and N.        Output                             For each word in the word list, output a pair of integers representing the             location of the corresponding word in the grid must be output. The integers must             be separated by a single space. The first integer is the line in the grid where             the first letter of the given word can be found (1 represents the topmost line             in the grid, and m represents the bottommost line). The second integer is the             column in the grid where the first letter of the given word can be found (1             represents the leftmost column in the grid, and n represents the rightmost             column in the grid). If a word can be found more than once in the grid, then the             location which is the output should correspond to the uppermost occurrence of             the word (i.e. the occurrence which places the first letter of the word closest             to the top of the grid). If two or more words are uppermost, the output should             correspond to the leftmost of these occurrences. All words can be found at least             once in the grid. Separate the output of each test case with a blank line.       Sample Input   8 11   abcDEFGhigg   hEbkWalDork   FtyAwaldoRm   FtsimrLqsrc   byoArBeDeyv   Klcbqwikomk   strEBGadhrb   yUiqlxcnBjf   4   Waldorf   Bambi   Betty   Dagbert   4 4   xbcd   xbcd   xbcd   abce   1   dcba   0 0       Sample Output   2 5   2 3   1 2   7 8       1 4     
      When displaying a collection of rectangular windows, a             critical step is determining whether two windows overlap, and, if so, where on             the screen the overlapping region lies. Write a program to perform this             function. Your program will accept as input the coordinates of two rectangular             windows. If the windows do not overlap, your program should produce a message to             the effect. If they do overlap, you should compute the coordinates of the             overlapping region (which must itself be a rectangle).          All coordinates are expressed in "pixel numbers",             integer values ranging from 0 to 9999. A rectangle will be described by two             pairs of (X, Y) coordinates. The first pair gives the coordinates of the lower             left hand corner (XLL, YLL). The second pair gives the coordinates of the upper             right hand coordinates (XUR, YUR). You are guaranteed that XLL<XUR and YLL<YUR.       Input                                The             first line will have a number N (0<N<=100) with the number of test cases. Each             test case will consists of two lines each containing four numbers. The first             line contains the integer numbers XLL, YLL, XUR and YUR for the first window.             The second contains the same numbers for the second window.        Output   For each test case, if the two window do no overlap,             print the   Message "No Overlap". If the two windows do overlap, print 4             integer numbers giving the XLL, YLL, XUR and YUR for the region of overlap.              Note that two windows that share a common edge but have no other point in common             are considered to have "No Overlap".       Sample Input   2   0 20 100 120   80 0 500 60   10 10 20 20   30 30 40 40       Sample Output   80 20 100 60   No Overlap      
           Alphabets                       You are provided a set of characters forming an alphabet, arranged in increasing         order of their weight. Write a program to sort a set of strings in ascending         order using the provided alphabet. The sorted output is to be displayed on the         screen.               Input:           First line contains the number of test cases. Each test case is separated by an         empty line. Each test case contains the following inputs:   Size of alphabet  Characters in alphabet  Strings to be sorted                Output:           For each test case, display the input strings in ascending order. Output of each         test should be separated by an empty line.               Sample Input           2           26           ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ           ABCD           ABCFX           ABCE                       26           ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA           ABCD           ABCFX           ABCE               Sample Output           ABCD           ABCE           ABCFX                       ABCFX           ABCE           ABCD 
           Fibonacci                       Recall the definition of the Fibonacci numbers:                       f1           f2           fnn-1+fn-2        (n>=3)                       Given two numbers a and b, calculate how many Fibonacci numbers are in the range         [a,b].               Input:           The input contains several test cases. Each test case consists of two         non-negative integer numbers a and b. Input is terminated by a=b=0. Otherwise,         a<=b<=10^100. The numbers a and b are given with no superfluous         leading zeros.               Output:           For each test case output on a single line the number of Fibonacci numbers fi         with a<=fi<=b.               Sample Input           10 100           1234567890 9876543210           0 0               Sample Output           5           4 
           Palindrome                               A simple recursive method to generate a numeric palindrome from any         number is to reverse its digits and add it to the original. If the sum is not a         palindrome (which means, it is not the same number from left to right and right         to left), repeat this procedure. For example for 195:       195 + 951 = 786       786 + 687 = 1473       1473 + 3741 = 5214       5214 + 4125 = 9339         Resulting palindrome      In         this particular case the palindrome 9339 appeared after 4th addition. This         method leads to palindromes in a few step for almost all of the integers. But         there are interesting exceptions. 196 is the first number for which no         palindrome has been found. It is not proven though, that there is no such a         palindrome.               Your         task is to write a program that gives the resulting palindrome and the number of         iterations (additions) to compute it. All tests data in this problem will have         an answer, will be computable with less than 1000 iterations (additions), which         will yield a palindrome that is not greater than 4,294,967,295.       Input                                 The first line will have a number N (0<N<=100) with the number of test         cases, the next N lines will each have a number P to compute its palindrome.               Output                    For each of the N numbers you will have to write a line with the minimum         number of iterations (additions) to get to the palindrome and the resulting         palindrome separated by one space.     Sample Input  3  195  265  750     Sample Output  4 9339  5         45254  3 6666       
When         displaying a collection of rectangular windows, a critical step is determining         whether two windows overlap, and, if so, where on the screen the overlapping         region lies. Write a program to perform this function. Your program will accept         as input the coordinates of two rectangular windows. If the windows do not         overlap, your program should produce a message to the effect. If they do         overlap, you should compute the coordinates of the overlapping region (which         must itself be a rectangle).                       All coordinates are expressed in "pixel numbers", integer values ranging         from 0 to 9999. A rectangle will be described by two pairs of (X, Y)         coordinates. The first pair gives the coordinates of the lower left hand corner         (XLL, YLL). The second pair gives the coordinates of the upper right hand         coordinates (XUR, YUR). You are guaranteed that XLL<XUR and YLL<YUR.       Input                          The first line will have a         number N (0<N<=100) with the number of test cases. Each test case will consists         of two lines each containing four numbers. The first line contains the integer         numbers XLL, YLL, XUR and YUR for the first window. The second contains the same         numbers for the second window.               Output           For each test case, if the two window do no overlap, print the             Message "No Overlap". If the two windows do overlap, print 4 integer numbers         giving the XLL, YLL, XUR and YUR for the region of overlap.  Note that two windows that share a         common edge but have no other point in common are considered to have "No         Overlap".     Sample Input  2  0 20         100 120  80 0         500 60  10 10         20 20  30 30         40 40     Sample Output  80 20         100 60  No         Overlap          
 Problem description. Sumit is enjoying his vacations alone in a 2D world (yes, he knows magic), until his GPS tracker stopped working. The great thing about his GPS tracker is that it sends the direction of his traveled path from the starting of his adventure to his best friend. Being his best friend, find Sumit's direction with respect to his starting position. It is sure that Sumit's final position doesn't coincides with his initial position.  Input  First line of input will contain an integer T , implying the number of testcases in the subtask.  Following T lines will contain distinct string S containing only following letters 'N' , 'S' , 'E' and  'W' , implying the four directions.   one of the example of the input string S is "NEWNEWS", which means that Sumit first moved one unit north and after moving one unit north he moved one unit to the east and after moving one unit to the east he moved one unit to the west ....so on and so forth....       Note:The directions are according to the geographical North , means if he moves EAST by one unit and after that again moves EAST by one unit, his final direction will be EAST (2 units) and  not  SOUTHEAST.  Output  For each test case, output a single line containing the final direction of Sumit. Output directions can be : "NORTH" , "SOUTH" , "EAST" , "WEST" , "NORTHEAST" , "NORTHWEST" , "SOUTHEAST" and "SOUTHWEST" .  Note:Only these 8 directions should be printed(without " ") and all letters should be uppercase.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ length of S ≤ 50   Example Input: 3 NEW NNSSE NE  Output: NORTH EAST NORTHEAST   Explanation move       Direction after move Testcase 1: N               NORTH E               NORTHEAST W              WEST  Testcase 2: N               NORTH N               NORTH(2 unit) S               NORTH(1 unit) S               NORTH(0 unit) , or, same as initial position.

 Problem Statement Bruce being very fond of Rachel, asks her out for 28th Feb, National Science Day. (Yeah! What a nerd :p) Not sure of her plan for the weekend, she asks him to do something extra-ordinary to prove his love. Rachel says "Bruce, today I want the Batman to be the Spiderman!".  Now given a vertical wall of NxM blocks, each block having some difficulty level. Batman has to climb the wall up from (0,0) to any block in the topmost layer. Not being as efficient as Spiderman, Bruce tries the greedy way out, from each block he can go up in any of the 3 available blocks (For any block the maximum possible blocks can be 3, diagonally left, just above and diagonally right), so he will always choose the block with the least difficulty. In case of two blocks with same difficulty, he always chooses the Leftmost one.   Batman can face a max difficulty of K units. Now your task is tell whether Bruce will get a date with Rachel or not.   Input   First line T, the number of test cases. Each test case consists of:  First line N M K, the dimensions of wall W and the Maximum difficulty Bruce can bear. Then a NxM matrix showing the difficulty levels of all the blocks.

   Background  Given a natural number n, find the summation of all its proper divisors. Definition: A proper divisor of a natural number is the divisor that is strictly less than the number. e.g. number 20 has 5 proper divisors: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, and the divisor summation is: 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 = 22.   Input:  An integer stating the number of test cases T and that many lines follow, each containing natural number n for which output will be summation of all its proper divisors.  Output:  One integer each line: the divisor summation of the integer given respectively.   Constraints  1<=T <=200000 1 <= n <= 500000   Sample Input  3 2 10 20   Sample Output  1 8 22    
 Problem You are living in 2050, People do not work any more. Only surrogates (clone having same features & DNA characteristics)  work for every individual. Government is substituting man labor by surrogates. Every person can control his own surrogate from his home and paid for his services one of the criminal master mind hacked into Government system and started producing multiple surrogates for a single person in Dolgeville, a small town in Texas. These multiple surrogates released in Dolgeville by that criminal. So now it might happen that there are 6 identical person named Hugh F. Bumblebee: the original person and its 5 copies. The Federal Bureau of Unauthorized Surrogates (FBUS) charged you with the task of determining how many copies were made from each person To help you in your task, FBUS have collected a DNA sample from each person. All surrogates of the same person have the same DNA sequence, and different people have different sequences (we know that there are no identical twins in the town, this is not an issue).  Sample Input The input contains several blocks of test cases. Each case begins with a line containing two integers: the number of people(n) and the length of the DNA sequences(m). The next n lines contain the DNA sequences: each line contains a sequence of m characters, where each character is either 'A', 'C', 'G' or 'T'. The input is terminated by a block with n = m = 0 .  Output For each test case, you have to output n lines, each line containing a single integer. The first line contains the number of different people that were not copied for surrogate. The second line contains the number of people that were copied only once (i.e., there are two identical copies for each such person.) The third line contains the number of people that are present in three identical copies, and so on: the i -th line contains the number of persons that are present in i identical copies. For example, if there are 11 samples, one of them is from John Smith, and all the others are from copies of Joe Foobar, then you have to print '1' in the first and the tenth lines, and '0' in all the other lines.  Constraints Number of people(n) in input must be 1 &lt n &lt 20000 Length of the DNA sequences(m) 1 &lt m &lt 20  Example Input:  9 6 AAAAAA ACACAC GTTTTG ACACAC GTTTTG ACACAC ACACAC TCCCCC TCCCCC 0 0 Output:  1 2 0 1 0 0 0 0 0  
 Problem Michal Scofield  and Lincon burrow are two brothers. By a murder allegation Lincon Burrow  was sentenced to  jail. Michal Scofield  some how came to know that his brother is not guilty and he don’t have time to file case against the allegations as his brother is going to sit on death chair soon enough. So he made a plan for Prison break before handing himself over to police in a robbery allegation he made tattoos on his whole body a way of encrypting messages. He decided secretly on the number of columns and write the message (letters only) down the columns, padding with extra random letters so as to make a rectangular array of letters. For example, if the message is “There’s no place like home on a snowy night” and there are five columns, Michal would write down  t o i o y h p k n n e l e a i r a h s g e c o n h s e m o t n l e w x  Note that Michal Scofield  includes only letters in between the tattoos and writes them all in lower case. In this example, Michael used the character ‘x’ to pad the message out to make a rectangle, although he could have used any letter. Michael then tattooed them by writing the letters in each row, alternating left-to-right and right-to-left. So, the above would be encrypted as  toioynnkpheleaigshareconhtomesnlewx  At the time of the break he forget  something about encryption .Your job is to recover for Michal the original message (along with any extra padding letters) from the encrypted one.  Input The first line have a integer T number of test cases. Input for each test case will consist of two lines. The first line will contain an integer c indicating the number of columns used. The next line is a string of up to 200 lower case letters.  Output Each input set should generate one line of output, giving the original plaintext message, with no spaces.

One of the most fundamental concepts learnt by a novice programmer is generation of Fibonacci Series. The Fibonacci Series is known to be of the form 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13... etc. Usually a recursive approach to solve the problems is applied. The problem with the usual recursive approach is that multiple calls are made to calculate the same number, which makes it time in-efficient. This algorithm runs in time theta(n). However, if you use either a Dynamic Programming approach or Memoization Technique, we can develop an algorithm that computes the nth Fibonacci number using at most O(log n) arithmetic operations. Your task is to write a program, using Dynamic Programming or Memoization or otherwise that computes the nth Fibonacci Number in  O(log n). The series need not begin from 0 1. Problem Setter:  Input The input will contain the number of test cases 'T' an integer. The next 'T' line contain 3 unsigned integers A, B and N (in each line) where A and B are respectively the first and the second term of the Modified Fibonacci series and N is the Nth term to be calculated.  Limits are as follows - 0 < A, B, T     Output You have to print the Nth Fibonacci term for each test case in the new line.  Example  Input: 7 0 1 10 2 3 5 67 101 9 23 46 35 45 37 24 45 27 1 45 46 2   Output: 34 13 2992 343398096 1857304 45 46   
 If a positional numeral system is used, a natural way of multiplying numbers is taught in schools as long multiplication, sometimes called grade-school  multiplication: multiply the multiplicand by each digit of the multiplier and then add up all the properly shifted results. It requires memorization of the  multiplication table for single digits.  This is the usual algorithm for multiplying by hand in base 10. Computers normally use a very similar shift and add algorithm in base 2. A person doing long  multiplication on paper will write down all the products and then add them together; an abacus-user will sum the products as soon as each one is computed.  Your task is to write a program that multiplies two arbitrary precision signed integers.  Note that for this particular problem the only allowed languages are C &  C++.  p> Problem Setter:  Input First line contains number of test cases, integer n < 20.Each test contains two signed integers on two lines of arbitrary length. Number of digits of the arbitrary  precision integers may extend upto 1000000.  Output: You need to print the sum of the two arbitrary precision signed numbers.   Sample Input: 3 -123456789987654 -9876543210 -7894561230123 1234567890 42134134710293471092734 812374198273491872435034  Sample Output: 1219326320880960097529340 -9746371800348756550470 34228683905221964318944087115419517161404442956   
You are given a matrix with N rows and M columns. Cell (x, y) indicates the cell at the intersection of x^th row and y^th column. Each cell of matrix contains some assigned value (say H). Visiting this cell, you will get H dollars (if H ≥ 0) else you have to pay |H| dollars. You start from cell (1, 1) and you have to reach cell (N, M). From a given cell, you can only move right or down. Formally, from cell (x, y), you can go to cell (x + 1, y) i.e down or cell (x, y + 1) i.e. right. In your way you have to collect maximum amount of money. However, there is a trick to mend the rule. You can pay P dollars and change the direction of at most 1 move i.e. instead of going down or right, you can pay P dollars and go to left or up. [cell (x - 1, y) or cell (x, y - 1) from cell (x, y).] After you use this trick once, you will again have to start moving from one cell to another cell in your old way (right or down). Visiting a cell previously visited will cause no more gain or loss in money since you already have collected or paid for this cell before. Given the amount present on each cell of matrix and the value of P, find the maximum money you can get while travelling from (1, 1) to (N, M). You cannot move out of grid during any of your moves.  Input The first line of each test file contains three space separated integers N, M and P denoting rows and columns of the matrix respectively. Next N lines follow, each contains M integers. The j^th integer on the i^th line indicates the amount of money in cell (i, j).  Output Output in a single line, an integer that represents the maximum amount of money you can collect. In case you are in loss (negative collection of money), print the minimum amount of loss (with negative sign to indicate loss).  Constraints  1 ≤ N, M ≤ 10^3 -10^6 ≤ Amount in each cell ≤ 10^6 1 ≤ P ≤ 10^5     Example Input: 3 3 1 1 3 1 5 3 5 2 1 1  Output: 18  Explanation Example case.We will choose the path (1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 2) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (3, 3). Total money gained during the path is 1 + 5 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 5 + 1 = 19. Since you went up on cell (2, 2), you pay 1 dollar. So final total profit is 18 dollars. 
You just purchased a general store and now you would like to stock up with some goods. You have N companies from which you can purchase. Also your store has M shelves, where the i^th shelf can accommodate Ai units of goods (of any company). Any two goods from the same company has to be put in the same shelf. Also, a shelf cannot have goods from any two different companies. The companies have two consignments from which they can supply goods to your store. Both of them have same type of goods. But the goods of first consignment are free (trial basis supply) and the second one has a charge. Formally, the i^th company can provide at most Xi units of goods for free and then will provide additional at most Yi units of goods at charge of Pi dollars per good. Your task is to stock up your store with as many goods as possible. Since you are there to make profit (obviously!), your would like to pay as little as possible. Find this minimum possible cost you need to pay to stock up as much as possible.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case has two space separated integers N and M. Next N lines follow, the i^th of which has three space separated integers, Xi, Yi and Pi. The next line has M integers A1, A2...AM denoting the storage capacity of shelves.  Output For each test case, output a single line containing two space separated integers, the first being maximum number of goods you can stock in store and the second being the minimum cost incurred to purchase them.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤  10 1 ≤ N ≤  300 1 ≤ M ≤  10^4 1 ≤ Xi, Yi, Ai, P ≤  10^3     Example Input: 1 3 1 5 3 1 1 2 4 2 1 1 6  Output: 6 1  Explanation Example case 1.We will choose the first company which gives 5 goods free and an additional 1 unit we will purchase at cost of 1 dollar. Hence we get our shelf fully filled with cost of 1 dollar. 
At the ACME University, as part of the Graduate course work, each student is required to undergo project work. The authorities always make an effort to find a match among the students’ interests and the interests of the faculty members. First, they take a list of topics from the students' and a list of topics from the faculty. In order to avoid identifying students and faculties, all they preserve is simply, two consolidated lists of topics – one from the students and one from the faculties. No personal identification exists within these lists. The lists are sorted in ascending order of the indices of project topics in the repository. No topic appears twice in the same list. To make the process simple, ACME University maintains a repository of 100 project topics - numbered from 1 to 100, inclusive. The students and faculty members must choose among those topics only. Their lists may have different number of topics; since more than one student (or faculty) may choose to work work on the same topic or some may like to work on multiple topics etc. Once these two lists have been obtained, the university tries to make them identical. The student’s list is modified to match with the faculty’s list. The modification may be via  inserting a new topic in the list deleting a topic from the list substituting a topic by another one  The university wants to do this with minimal number of modifications to the list as each modification needs one full day to be communicated and accepted by the students. It is assumed that the students do not disagree to any such modification. Write a program that accepts the lists from students and faculties and computes the minimum number of modifications that will require to be made to make the student's list identical to the faculty's list.  Input The input contains several test cases. The first line of the input contains the number T, the number of test cases. The first line in each test case contains the number M, the number of topics in the students' list. The second line contains M integers A1, A2 .., AM separated by single space characters. The third line in each test case contains the number N, the number of topics in the faculty's list. The fourth line contains N integers B1, B2 .., BN separated by single space characters.  Output Output T numbers, each on a line by itself, without any leading spaces or zeros. The number should be the minimum number of modifications that can be made to the students' list to make it identical to the faculty's list, for each respective test case.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ M, N ≤ 100 1 ≤ Ai, Bi ≤ 100 The list { A1 .. AM } has no duplicates. The list { A1 .. AM } is sorted in ascending order. The list { B1 .. BN } has no duplicates. The list { B1 .. BN } is sorted in ascending order.  Sample Input  2 4 1 3 5 7 2 4 6 3 1 2 3 2 2 3   Sample Output  4 1   Explanation In the first test case 1, 3, 5 and 7 should be deleted from the list and 4 and 6 should be inserted. But this can take 6 modifications. Instead, we can delete either two of the 4 topics from the students' list and substitute the remaining two by 4 and 6 respectively. This takes 4 modifications. 4 modifications is optimal for this test case. 
 A fraction a/b is called in its lowest form if gcd(a, b) = 1. It is possible to express a/b using the sum of a finite number of reciprocals of natural numbers. For example, 2/7 can be written as 1/4 + 1/28. Such a representation is called an Egyptian fraction representation of a/b. For each fraction, there could be multiple Egyptian fraction representations.  Let two sets of reciprocals be (p1, p2, ..., pn) and (q1, q2, ..., qk). We say, the first is lexicographically lesser than the second if there is some m, 1 ≤ m ≤ min(n,k) such that,  p1 = q1, p2 = q2, ..., pm-1 = qm-1 and pm ≤ qm.  Given a set of fractions in the lowest form, the problem is to generate the lexicographically least Egyptian fraction for each input fraction.  Input  The input consists of several lines, each line consisting of a pair of numbers separated by a blank space. The end of the input is signaled by a line containing the pair of numbers 1 and 1. Each pair on a single line will be positive numbers, co-prime to each other (except for the last line). The first number on any line is always less than or equal to the second number on the line.  Output  For each pair of numbers a and b on a line, output a sequence of numbers, representing the denominators of the lexicographically least Egyptian Fraction of a/b. The denominators should be sorted in ascending order. There should be a blank space separating one denominator from the next. You should NOT output the Egyptian Fraction representation of the last line, representing 1/1 = 1.  Sample Input  1 4 2 7 5 9 1 1   Sample Output  4 4 28 2 18  
Recently, Aparna and Surya were extremely excited by use of linear algebra in natural language processing. They realized that linear algebra was the key to many information retrieval algorithms as mentioned by their professor or otherwise. So one night, they went to the library to explore further.   Surya suddenly posed a seemingly random question. He asked Aparna, assume I have a graph of n vertices and m edges. Now if I construct a symmetric matrix; he flirtatiously adds (as he always does), I like symmetry cause knowing one half you can get the other, just like the two of us. He continues, "I will define the (i,j) entry as follows: M(i,j) = 1 if degree(i)!=0 and i=j M(i,j) = -1/sqrt(degree(i)*degree(j)) if i vertex i is adjacent to j in graph I give M(i,j) = 0 otherwise.  He then says, I will now calculate the eigenvalues of this matrix. Can you tell me if the difference between the largest eigenvalue and the second smallest eigenvalue is at-least 2.  Surya quickly realized he has to get out an eigenvalue decomposer. Both sit and started to code, while Siddhartha approaches them with his MATLAB code. Your task is to answer Surya's question before Siddhartha does so that you can score some brownie points ;)   Input Input description.  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers N, M denoting the number of vertices and edges. Then M lines follow. the ith line describes the ith edge. It contains two space separated integers u and v. Note the vertices are 0-indexed.     Output Output description.  For each test case, output a single line containing "YES" if the difference in largest eigenvalue and second smallest eigenvalue is at-least 2. "NO" otherwise. (Quotes for clarity. Do not print them)     Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 20 3 ≤ N ≤ 500 1 ≤ M ≤ N*(N+1)/2  For floating point calculations, ignore decimal point rounding upto 10^-6     Example Input: 1 3 3 0 1 0 2 1 2  Output: NO    Explanation Example case 1. The matrix as per the specifications is 1 -0.5 -0.5 -0.5 1 -0.5 -0.5 -0.5 1 The eigenvalues are 0,1.5,1.5 . Hence the difference between largest eigenvalue and second smallest eigenvalue is 1.5 - 1.5 = 0. which is strictly less than 2. Warning Input text files contains large I/O. Consider using faster I/O techniques. 
There are N cities in the country and some of them are connected by bidirectional roads. To handle any emergency situation, they need a emergency cell to be set up at some cities such that, in case of any emergency in a city, the fire engine, the ambulance etc., can reach that city. Setting up a emergency cell is expensive and as occurrence of a emergency situation is very rare, its just enough to have each city connected ( possibly through other cities, by a path ) to a city which has an emergency cell. Given the cost to setup emergency cell in each of the cities and the map of the country, find the minimum amount of money government needs to spend. In other words, the Government needs to select a set of cities S to set up emergency cells such that, every city in the country is connected to at least one city in S.  Input  The first line contains the number of test cases T. T cases follow. Each test case starts with a line containing N M, N is the number of cities numbered 1 to N and M is the number of bidirectional roads. Next line contains N integers, the ith integer is the cost of setting up emergency cell in the ith city. Each of the next M lines contains, x y , meaning x and y are directly connected by a bidirectional road. There can be multiple roads between a pair of cities and some roads may even connect a city with itself.  Output Output T lines, one for each case containing the required answer.  Constraints  1 <= T <= 5 1 <= N <= 100000 0 <= M <= 100000 0 <= cost_i <= 10000 0 <= x,y < N  Example  Input: 1 4 3 2 4 1 5 1 2 2 3 4 4  Output: 6   Explanation: Minimum cost is 6, by selecting city 3 and city 4 
On New Year's Eve, in a quiet air traffic monitor's tower, the poor controller realised that he was going to be working at midnight as well. Being a superstitious person, he believes that wishing at least k people at midnight will bring him good luck for the rest of the year. He decides to broadcast a happy new year message to the planes passing by, but wants to broadcast this message only once, and only for the minimum possible radius that will accomodate k planes. Please help this eccentric man. All planes travel at uniform speed in a straight line.  Input  The first line of the input contains two integers N and K separated by a space character.( 0 < N < 10000 , 0 < K < 10000) ) N is the total number of planes. K is the number of planes the controller wants to wish. Each of the next N lines contain four integers x1, y1, x2, y2 separated by a space character. ( -2000 < x,y < 2000) x1 and y1 represent the initial coordinates of a plane (at time zero), while x2 and y2 represent the co-ordinates of the plane after 1 second.   Output  On the first line, output the minimum radius required to reach k planes, accurate to two decimal places. On one line, output a single integer, which shows the number of seconds after which the message is to be broadcasted.  Example  Input: 5 3 0 1 2 3 1 0 0 1 1 2 2 0 1 2 3 2 1 3 4 2  Output: 2.24 0

  The Restaurant was starting to fill up as Debra Morgan walked in. She scanned the crowd for her sister, brother-in-law, and nephew. Seeing her sister waving from the far end of the restaurant, she made her way back to their booth. “Hi, Debra”, her sister and brother-inlaw, Astor and Quinn Chapman, greeted her.  “Hi, guys”, she replied. “What are you doing, John?” she asked her nephew. He was busy working on one of the restaurant's activity sheets with a crayon.  “I'm doing a word search game,” John explained. “I have to find all of these words in this big mess of letters. This is really hard.” John looked intently at the paper in front of him.  “Can I help?” asked Debra, looking across the table at the activity sheet.  “Sure. These are the words we're looking for. They're the names of different kinds of Planes, Trains, and Automobiles.”  Input The first line of input will specify the length of the sides of the letter matrix (the matrix of letters will be square). The length, l, will be in the range 1 ≤ l ≤ 100. The next l lines of input will be the matrix itself, each line will contain l uppercase letters. A list of words will follow. Each word will be on a line by itself; there will be 100 or fewer words. Each word will be 100 or fewer characters long, and will only contain uppercase letters.  The final line of input will contain a single zero character.  Output Your program should attempt to find each word from the word list in the puzzle. A word is “found” if all the characters in the word can be traced in a single (unidirectional) horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line in the letter matrix. Words may not “wrap around” rows, columns or diagonals.  -Horizontal words may proceed from right to left (''backwards'') and vice versa.  -Vertical words may proceed upwards and downwards.  -Diagonal words may proceed from left to right (both upward and downward) but not in right to left direction.  For each word that is found, your program should print the coordinates of its first and last letters in the matrix on a single line, separated by a single space. Coordinates are pairs of comma-separated integers (indexed from 1), where the first integer specifies the row number and the second integer specifies the column number.  If a word is not found, the string “Not found” should be output instead of a pair of coordinates.  Each word from the input can be “found” at most once in the puzzle.  Sample Input 5 EDEEE DISKE ESEEE ECEEE EEEEE DISC DISK IEEE DISP 0  Sample Output 1,2 4,2 2,1 2,4 2,2 5,5 Not found  
 In the “Dancing Words” problem, we are concerned with words constructed using the lowercase letters  of the English alphabet - that is, a,b,c,...,z. These words need not necessarily be meaningful, any sequence  of letters forms a word. For example, abbcada is a word.  We say that we can "hop" from the word word1 to the word word2 if they are "sufficiently close". We define  word2 to be sufficiently close to word1 if one of the following holds:   - word2 is obtained from word1 by deleting one letter.  - word2 is obtained from word1 by replacing one of the letters in word1 by some letter that appears  to its right in word1 and which is also to its right in alphabetical order.  For example, we can hop from abbca to abca by deleting the second (or third letter). We can hop from aabca to abbca by replacing the a in the second position by the letter b that appears  to the right of the a in aabca and which is also to its right in alphabetical order.  On the other hand we cannot hop from abbca to aabca since we would need to replace the b  in the second position by a, but a is to the left of b in alphabetical order.  You will be given a collection of words W. Your task is to find the length of the longest sequence  w1,w2,w3…… of distinct words from W such that we may hop from w1 to w2, w2 to w3 and so on.  We call this the hopping number for this set.  For example, if W = {abacd, bcdada, dd, abcd,bcdd, adcd, addd, aa, ccd, add, ad}, then  the hopping number is 7 corresponding to the sequence abacd, abcd, adcd, addd, add, ad, dd  Input format The first line of the input contains one integer N indicating the number of words in the input.  This is followed by N lines of input, lines 2, 3,..., N+1, each containing one word over the letters {a,b,..., z}.  Output format The output should be a single integer, indicating the hopping number of the given set of words.  Test Data: You may assume N ≤ 100. You may assume that each word has at most 10 letters.  Example: Here is the sample input and output corresponding to the example discussed above.  Sample Input 11 abacd bcdada dd abcd bcdd adcd addd aa ccd add ad  Sample Output 7 
Having flexed his grey cells a bit, Little Neumann craves for more. Having been taught the basics of English and Latin, he now sees the golden thread connecting the English language and his primary fascination, mathematics.  Having seen long words in his study, Little Neumann wants to know the maximum number of words a given word can be split into, such that the resulting words all form legitimate words contained in a given dictionary.  For example, the string AMANGO can be split as {A, MANGO}, {A, MAN, GO} and {AM, AN, GO}, wherein, each of the resulting words is contained within the dictionary {A, AM, AN, GO, MAN}, here the final set of split up words does not produce any word that is not contained in the dictionary.   Input  First line contains the number of test cases to follow, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10, Next line contains the String, n that has to be divided into words. The size of the string is between [1,1500], both inclusive. Next line contains, l the number of words in the dictionary, 1 ≤ l ≤ 100 Next l line contains l words.  Note: There is one line gap between two test cases.   Output For each test case output the maximum number of words that can be generated from the string.  Example  Input: 2 amantentononewitheel 19 a an am ant ent tent man ten on one ton no none new with the he heel wit  amango 5 a am an man go  Output: 7 3   ExplanationFor case 1: the split for this string is: a, man, ten, ton, one, wit, new  
 Claude Shannon has just begun designing his electronic mouse experiment. In this experiment of his, he's trying to build an intelligent mechanical mouse which can find the quickest way to reach the centre of a maze it's put in. But before getting on with his design, Shannon wants to have an idea of the shortest path his mouse would take for a given maze. He needs such data for testing his system. Being involved in matters of greater importance, he's hired you as his project intern. Your task is to list out the shortest path his mouse can take, given the dimensions of a two dimensional maze and the expected start and end points of the mouse. If there are multiple such shortest paths, just mention one of them.   Input  First line contains, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10, the number of test cases, and then t test cases follow The first line of each test case starts with two integers, n m, which is the size of the field. The first cell is addressed as '0 0' In the maze inaccessible cells are represented as '#' and the accessible cells are represented as '.' The next line contains two pair of integers; first pair corresponds to the starting point and the second pair corresponding to the end point. Then the maze of n x m size follows (see example).   Output  If there exists a path between the given starting and the end point, then output the address of each cell starting from the starting cell, in order to be followed to reach the end cell (see example). In case more than one path exists than output any of them. In case no such path exists, output -1.   Example  Input: 2 5 5 0 0 4 4 ..... ####. ..... .#### ..... 4 4 0 0 3 3 .... #### .... ....  Output: 0 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 1 4 2 4 2 3 2 2 2 1 2 0 3 0 4 0 4 1 4 2 4 3 4 4 -1

It is high time now, IT companies are hiring in huge numbers. Now that they have hired they need to form teams each containing exactly 2 members. No two members in the team have the same age. In any team, older is given the position of a Developer (D) and younger is given the position of a Tester (T). They have sorted all the members to form a list according to their ages (such that youngest in the list is the first). However even before forming teams they have assigned designations (D or T) to all the members in the list. Now it is your duty to tell whether it is still possible to form teams with the requirements stated above and also maintain the assigned designation of each of the persons.    Input 1st line: An Integer T denoting the number of test cases Each test Case Contains: A single line representing the list consists of only 'T '& / or  'D'    Output T lines each containing  'YES'  (if possible to form group) or  'NO'  (if not possible).   Example  Input: Input 2 TTDD DDDDDD   Output: YES NO  CONSTRAINTS  1 ≤ T  ≤ 20 1 ≤ length(list)  ≤ 1,00,000

The palindrome is a string that can be read the same way from left to right and from right to left. For example, strings "level", "5665" are palindromes, however the string "coder" is not a palindrome.  We define "Lucky String" if it has an even length and the first half of this string is equal to the second half of this string. Like "papa" is an easy string because the first half "pa" is equal to the second half "pa", however the string "adda" is not an easy string because the first half "ad" is not equal to the second half "da".  If you are given N length of palindrome string, what is the maximal possible number of characters/symbols in an "easy string" that can be obtained by removing and changing the order of characters/symbols in the palindrome?  Input:    The first line of the sample input contains an integer T - the number of test cases. Then, T lines follow.   Each line consists of a single integer N - the length of a palindrome.   Output:   For each test case output a single integer - answer to the problem.    Constraints:   • 1<=T<=10000   • 1<=N<=1000000000   Sample Input: 2 5 4  Sample Output: 4 4 
Least Distance Mr. John has a habit of implementing new programming methods. This time he needs your help to solve a problem. He needs a method such that it accepts a series of numbers (all in single digits) and returns a typical answer. The answer must be the least distance between any two ADJACENT numbers.   For Example: If the series of numbers submitted is :4 8 6 1 2 9 4 The output must yield '1'  since the least difference between 2 neighbouring numbers is 1 i.e between 1 and 2.   Note that order of numbers do not matter. In above example, 2 may have appeared before 1. Neglect if the difference is a negative number.  Input First line of input must contain a series of numbers. All numbers must be between 0 and 9 i.e. single digits.  Output Second Line is the output of the given input.  Example  Input: 4 8 6 1 2 9 4  Output: 1   Input: 5 7 4 9 7 2  Output: 2

 Pratyush, a six year old kid has just learnt how to write 1 through 1000 in decimal number system(DNS). Being a very curious kid, he made some modifications in DNS and removed the digits 0 through 3 and 7 through 9. So the only digits remaining to be used are 4, 5 and 6. He started enumerating numbers with these digits in increasing order viz. 4, 5, 6, 44, 45, 46, 54, 55, 56, 64, 65, 66, 444 ... and so on. Ecstatic with his discovery he named it Pratyush Number System(PNS). Then he had an idea. He called his 10 year old brother Keshav and put forward a problem for him. Given a number n in DNS, give the nth number that appears in PNS. For example for n=3, answer is 6. For n=13, answer is 444.   Input  First line of input is a single integer T, after which T test cases follow. Each test case is a line with a single integer n in decimal number system.   Output  For each test case output the corresponding number in PNS followed by a new line character.

 Problem Description An online quiz is going to be held at NIT Hamirpur. Each student will be given a system which is connected to internet. Although all the systems are connected to same network, there is still varying data transfer speed among them. This can cause pages to load slower on one system than the other. The organizers do not want a participant to have an advantage over others due to this. The organizers can't increase transfer speed on a system but they can cap it. Also they want to provide maximum speed to each system. Suppose there are n systems and m participants and speed of each of the n systems is known. Your task is to tell them the maximum speed they should keep on each system, so that atleast m of n systems have the same speed.  Input First line containing two space separated inputs (n and m) - the number of computer and participants respectively. The next line contains a space separated sequence of n integers: a1, a2, ..., an - where ai denotes the speed of i^th computer in KB/s.

 Problem description In the climax of an upcoming Bollywood movie "BHAI HO!", Bhai is standing at the centre of a large battlefield. Bhai is sorrounded by the army of Bacchha Singh from all sides. Each soldier of Bacchha's army is at some distance from Bhai. They all are heading towards Bhai with swords in their hands. At the centre, Bhai has a gun with unlimited Bullets. And you know, Bhai never misses a shot!. But a hurdle to Bhai is that he has to reload the gun after he has fired 6 bullets.  Bhai is killing soldiers at one soldier per second. By this time, every other soldier moves a step towards Bhai. Also, the reloading of the gun takes one second.  Now, you have to tell whether Bhai will be able to survive or not. And if Bhai fails in killing them all, tell the Number of soldiers killed by Bhai before falling.   Input The first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. T test cases follow. In each test case, the first line contains an integer N, denoting the number of soldiers. In the next line, there are N integers representing the distance of each soldier from Bhai.   Output For each test case Print the result as: If Bhai survives: Bhai Ho! if Bhai fails: Killed M Here M is the number of soldiers Bhai killed before dying.   Constraints   1 <= T <=100 1 <= N <=50000 1 <= D[i] <= 50000  Example Input: 2 5 3 4 3 7 9 5 3 3 3 3 3  Output: Bhai Ho! Killed 3

  Indian Institute of Technology, Banaras Hindu University is organizing an annual cultural festival. An organizing committee has been formed to get all the preprations done for the fest. The convener of the fest has decided to invite the American Band, Linkin Park to the institute. which in turn gets disadvantageous as the cost incurred in organizing a show increases with each day.   On day 1, today, the committee has to pay ‘A’ dollars in order to organize the show. After each passing day, the cost in organizing the show becomes A times the price on the previous day. Any normal person would invite them on the 1st day itself as the price will be the lowest but the problem with the committee is that it needs some time to get all the approvals for inviting the band. Therefore it needs ‘B’ days to get the approvals before making the band an offer.   You, being a part of the financial team of the fest have the responsibility to calculate the cost of organizing the show. Your task is to ask the Linkin Park team on the Bth day. Since, the price can be a very large number, please tell them the price modulo (10^9 + 7).   Input The first line contains an integer T, the number of testcases. It’s followed by T lines. Each testcase will contain two integers A & B separated by a space.   Output Output T lines, each corresponding to the answer of the testcase.  Note: Both integers will have a maximum of 100000 digits.    Constraints 1 <= T <= 10   1 <= A,B <= 10^100000     Example Input: 5 3 2 4 5 7 4 34534985349875439875439875349875 93475349759384754395743975349573495 34543987529435983745230948023948 3498573497543987543985743989120393097595572309482304  Output: 9 1024 2401 735851262 985546465    Explanation As value of 32 = 9, So output for first case will be 9.   Similarly 45 modulo (10^9 + 7) = 1024.   Similarly 74 modulo (10^9 + 7) = 2401.   Similarly we can do for others.

People have been judging Flippy, the fish, by his ability to climb trees and thus making Flippy feel stupid. As a result Flippy has started to get depressed. Concerned about her son, Flippy's mother, Petunia, has brought him a flying boat to cheer him up. The boat can not only fly as high as the tall trees, but it can also move in any of the 2*K directions of the K-dimensional world Flippy lives in.   The position of the boat is denoted by its coordinates and is given by a sequence of K integers {C1, C2...CK}. At the beginning the boat is at the position where each of the K coordinates are 0. Moving one step in a direction will either increment or decrement one of the K coordinates. The boat has 2*K+2 buttons which are labeled from 1 to 2*K+2. Two of the buttons are 'start' and 'stop'. The other 2*K buttons become active once the start button is pressed and they become inactive as soon as stop is pressed. Each of these 2*K buttons correspond to one of the 2*K directions and move the boat one step in that direction if pressed when active. For instance, a button corresponding to the positive direction of the j^th coordinate will change Cj to Cj+1. No two buttons move the boat in the same directions. Pressing the start button when the boat has already been started has not effect and similarly, pressing the stop button when the boat has not been started has not effect.  Flippy has spent most of his life under the sea, eating seaweed and blowing bubbles with his friends. So he is terrified at the thought of flying in a boat all alone. Moreover, he has no clue what operations each of the buttons perform! When he sits in the boat for the first time, he panics so much that he shuts his eyes tightly and goes berserk pressing buttons arbitrarily. After Flippy opens his eyes, the poor fish finds himself stranded in an unknown place with no way of going back home! But all is not lost. The boat has a navigation screen which shows the coordinates of its current position. It also shows the exact sequence of buttons Flippy pressed in the order they were pressed. Flippy will give you the information showed on the screen. Please help Flippy figure out the roles each of the 2*K+2 buttons.  Note that the coordinates can be negative - The magnificent boat can go under water too!   Input Input description.  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers N denoting the number of buttons pressed by flippy and K The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the the labels of the buttons Flippy pressed with A1 being the first button pressed and AN being the last. The third line contains K space-separated integers C1, C2, ..., CK, the coordinates shown on the screen.   Output Output description.  For each test case, print 2*K+2 space separated integers denoting a permutation of the 2*K+2 labels of the buttons, such that the first button in the permutation is the start button, the second button is the stop button and the 2*(j+1)-1^th button is the one which increases the j^th coordinate of the boat by one, and the 2*(j+1)^th button decreases the j^th coordinate of the boat by 1. If there are multiple such permutations possible find the lexicographically smallest one and hope that Flippy reaches home safely.  If it is not possible to reach the coordinates showed on the screen with the sequence of buttons Flippy pressed then Flippy is indeed a stupid fish! So, output "Stupid Fish" (without quotes) instead.    Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 20 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ K ≤ 6 1 ≤ Ai ≤ 2*K+2 -10^5 ≤ Ci ≤ 10^5   Example Input: 2 10 2 5 4 2 1 5 3 2 5 1 3 -2 2 4 3 2 2 2 2 0 0 -1  Output: 2 3 4 1 5 6 Stupid Fish  Explanation In the first test case, Flippy lives in a 2-dimensional world, and the boat ends up at (-2,2). Suppose the start button has label 2 and the stop button has label 3, then, only the presses A[4],A[5],A[8] and A[9] affect the position of the boat. Notice that the boat can be started multiple times.One of button 5  and button 1 has to be the button which decreases the first coordinate and the other one has to be the button which increases the second coordinate. Taking button 1 as the button for decreasing the first coordinate gives a lexicographically smaller solution. In the second test case, if we take 2 to be the start button, then no other buttons are pressed and the position of boat cannot change. If 2 is not the start button then the button 2 will not have any effect because the boat has never been started. So, there's no solution.

 Chef likes to travel a lot. Every day Chef tries to visit as much cities as possible. Recently he had a quite a few trips of great Chefland for learning various recipes. Chefland had N cities numbered from 1 to N. People in Chefland are very friendly, friendliness of i-th city is given by Fi.  Before starting of each trip, Chef's initial enjoyment is 1 unit. Whenever he visits a city with friendliness Fi, his enjoyment gets multiplied by Fi units.   City 1 is the home city of Chef. He starts each trip from his home city. Before starting a trip, he chooses a parameter R which denotes that he will start from city 1, and go to city 1 + R, then to 1 + 2 * R, then to 1 + 3 * R, till 1 + i * R such that i is largest integer satisfying 1 + i * R ≤ N.   Now, Chef wants you to help him recreate his visit of the cities. Specifically, he will ask you Q queries, each of which can be of following two types.  1 p f : friendliness of p-th city changes to f, i.e. Fp = f 2 R   : Find out the total enjoyment Chef will have during this trip. As Chef does not like big numbers, he just asks you to output two things, first digit of the enjoyment and value of enjoyment modulo 10^9 + 7.   Input There is a single test case. First line of input contains a single integer N, denoting number of cities in Chefland. Second line of the input contains N space separated integer - F1, F2, ..., FN, denoting the friendliness of the cities in order from 1 to N. Next line contains an integer Q, denoting number of queries. For each of the next Q queries, each line corresponds to one of the two types of the query. First there will be an integer denoting the type of the query, followed by the actual query. For query of type 1, there will be three space separated integers "1 p f" as defined above. For query of type 2, there will be two space separated integers "2 R ", as defined above.  Output For each query of type 2, output two space separated integers, first digit of Chef's enjoyment in this trip followed by the value of enjoyment modulo 10^9 + 7.  Constraints   1 ≤ N, Q ≤ 10^5  1 ≤ Fi ≤ 10^9  1 ≤ f ≤ 10^9  1 ≤ p ≤ N  1 ≤ R ≤ N   Example Input: 5 1 2 3 4 5 3 2 1 1 3 10 2 2  Output: 1 120 5 50  Explanation In the first query, Chef is going to visit cities 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 in order. At the end of the trip, his total enjoyment will be 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120. First digit of enjoyment is 1 and 120 modulo 10^9 + 7 is 120. In the third query, Chef is going to visit cities 1, 3, 5 in order. At the end of the trip, his total enjoyment will be 1 * 10 * 5 = 50.

  All of us must have played the game of jumping monkeys in our childhood. It was a simple game where one had to put a monkey on a tree using a catapult. The catapult threw the monkey into a specific height in the air such that it may landed on an artificial tree. This summer one of your cousin visited you during your vacation, with a newer version of the game. This time instead of a single tree the monkey had to be taken up gradually along different levels. The height of these levels could be adjusted manually. The one to take the monkey up first would win the game. One day while playing your mischievous cousin set the height of one of the platform higher than the height to which the catapult could actually throw the monkey. You were unaware of this fact and started playing the game but could never complete it as you got stuck on that level. The next day your cousin left for his place. You were still embarrassed by you stupid defeat and thus you decided to make a program that would tell you in advance if there was even the possibility of you completing the game or not.     Input  The first line of input would contain the number of test cases.T The next line would contain the height to which the catapult could throw the monkey(H) and the number of platform present in that case(N). This would then be followed by the height of various platforms, all separated by single space. The height of all the platforms would be randomly arranged.  Assume that you are always at height zero (0) in the beginning.     Output For each of the test case you have to tell if it would be possible for you to complete the game or not. If possible give output as ‘Yes’ and otherwise give ‘No’.    Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 1000 1 ≤ H,N ≤ 10000     Example Input: 2 3 7 10 12 15 4 7 1 3 4 9 12 15 2 14 21 18 4 25 7  Output: Yes No   
 Young Matt and Jeff loved playing with numbers. One fine day, when Matt's little brother Paul, was at his math lesson with plastic number toys i.e. plastic toys in shape of digits 0 to 9, Matt and Jeff decided to play a game. Paul had left the plastic numbers arranged to form a number N. The rules of the game were as follows:  The first player has to rearrange the digits to form a larger number than the current number, after that the game will be played turn-wise. After the first turn, each player has to rearrange the digits so that it is smaller than the current number in that turn and greater than the original number N.  The player loses if he cannot arrange a number.   What number should the first player form, so that he always wins?  Input An integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 100) denoting number of test cases followed by T lines each containing an  integer N, the number Paul has formed. The number of digit in N is D(1 ≤ D ≤ 100000).  Output  For each test case, output a number which first player should form so that he wins, in a separate line.If there is no winning strategy for first player, then output -1.  Example  Input: 3 17 81 123  Output: 71 -1 132

 The Government of Greedistan has just found out that there is a lot of gold beneath some land area in their country. They quickly surveyed the land area and found that some people are living there, and surprisingly the houses are organized in a M x N grid, each cell having exactly one house. To acquire all the gold beneath this area, the government has planned to make up a rumor ( a volcano is about to erupt near by ) and let the people vacate their houses themselves. They start the rumor at only one house on day 1. It takes exactly one day for the rumor to spread from a house to any of its neighbors ( top, left, bottom, right ). They all vacate their houses as soon as they know about the volcano.  The government wants to choose the starting house for the rumor in such a way that it takes minimum number of days for all the people to vacate their houses. Find this minimum time.  Input The first line contains T, the number of test cases. Each of the next T lines contain two integers M and N. If one of M or N is zero, other one will also be zero, and this means, there are no houses at all.  T ≤ 1,000 0 ≤ M ≤ 1,000,000 0 ≤ N ≤ 1,000,000   Output  The minimum number of days it takes to spread the rumor to all houses.   Example  Input: 2 1 5 3 4  Output: 3 4  Explanation: Case 1 : Starting cell (1,3) Case 2 : See the following table with a possible answer, each cell has the first day in which they hear the rumor.   3234  2123  3234  
Presti Digitator, the world-famous magician, is highly dissatisfied with his way of shuffling cards. Just yesterday, a perky guy in the audience demanded that he shuffle the cards once again, and he was aghast to see that the bottom card had not changed. Even though Mr. Digitator pacified the crowd with a few excellent tricks, the whole experience left him sad. He thinks that his shuffling leaves too many cards unchanged. He has decided to return to the drawing board, and retrain himself. He thinks that a "good" shuffle should leave no card in its old position. Assume that cards are numbered sequentially starting from 1. For example, if there are 4 cards initially arranged in the order 1,2,3,4, a shuffle of 2,3,4,1 would be considered good, while 3,2,1,4 would be bad since 2 and 4 are unchanged in the shuffled order. Digitator wonders whether good shuffles are rare - he would like to know, how many good shuffles of a given deck of cards there are.  Input For this question, you are given a series of numbers on distinct lines. The first line contains a number (let’s call it n) denotes how many decks there are to shuffle. This is followed by n lines, each containing a positive number less than or equal to 20. Each such number denotes the number of cards in that deck.  Output The output should have several lines. The i-th line is the number of good shuffles for the number of cards described in the i-th line. The output will fit inside a 64-bit integer.  Example  Input: 2 2 4  Output: 1 9  
 Tarun and Varun are learning game theory. Today they came up with a new game.  The rules are as follows:  Initially they have a string consisting of lowercase english alphabets only. Each of them take turn. In each turn, a player removes some alphabets from the string (at least one). But the condition is all the alphabets removed must be same (see explanation of the test cases). The player who is unable to make a move loses.   You are given the string and the player who makes the first move. You have to print the name of the winner.  Input  The first line of the input will contain a single integer T, the number of test cases. Each of next T lines will contain two strings separated by a space. First is the name of the player who starts the game (“Tarun” or “Varun” without quotes ), second is the input string with which the game is to be played.   Output  Print “Tarun”, if Tarun wins, else print “Varun” without the quotes.   Constraints 1 <= T <= 100  Input string will contain lower case alphabets only. Length of input string will not exceed 100.  Sample Cases Input 3 Tarun aaa Varun ababa Tarun abacd Output Tarun Varun Tarun  Explanation  Tarun can remove all three 'a' and win. Varun can remove a single 'a' in his turn. Tarun will be left with two 'b' and two 'a'. If he removes both 'b' Varun can remove both 'a' and win, else if he removes a single 'a', Varun will be left with 'a', 'b' and 'b'. Varun can remove a single 'b', then Tarun will be left with 'a' and 'b'. Whatever he removes, Varun will remove the last letter and win.  Note: Remember neither of them can remove letters like {'a','a','b'}, {'a','b','a','b'} etc as the condition says all the letters removed must be same. 
Alice and Bob, both have to drink water. But they both don't want to go, so they will play a game to decide who will fetch water for both of them. Alice will choose a number randomly between 1 and N (both inclusive) and Bob will choose a number randomly between 1 and M (both inclusive). Both will write their numbers on a slip of paper. If sum of numbers choosen by both is odd, then Alice will go, else Bob will go. What is probability that Alice will go?   Input First line contains, T, the number of testcases. Each testcase consists of N and M in one line, separated by a space.  Output For each test case, output a single line containing probability as an irreducible fraction.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ N,M ≤ 10^9   Example Input: 3 1 1 1 2 2 3 Output: 0/1 1/2 1/2  Explanation #test1: The only way is when Alice and Bob both choose 1. So, Alice won't have to go because sum is even. #test2: The different ways are (1,1) and (1,2), where first term denotes the number choosen by Alice. So of all possible cases (ie. 2) in only 1 case Alice has to go. Therefore, probability is 1/2. #test3: The different ways are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3) where first term denotes the number choosen by Alice. So of all possible cases (ie. 6) in only 3 cases Alice has to go. Therefore, probability is 1/2.

  In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer N, denoted by N!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to N. The factorial operation is encountered in many areas of mathematics, notably in combinatorics, algebra, and mathematical analysis. Its most basic occurrence is the fact that there are N! ways to arrange N distinct objects into a sequence (i.e., permutations of the set of objects). Today, Ross is working on a complicated combinatorial problem and he needs to find out factorials of some small integers. Help him!!    Input  First line contains an integer T. Each of next T lines contain an integer N   Output  For  every integer N, print value of N! in new line.     Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 0 ≤ N ≤ 100     Example Input: 3 5 6 7  Output: 120 720 5040

  Problem description. Garg in recent past has seen a lot of nightmares – basically Numerical Nightmares.  The evil entity in his dreams seemed to show Garg a particular function as follows :-  int troll(N) { 	r=0 	for (i = 1 ,i<=N ,i++) 	{       		if N%i==0          	     r += foo(i) 	} 	return r }   int foo(N) {     r = 0     for (i = 1 ,i<=N ,i++)     {        if gcd(N,i) == 1              r++     }     return r }   Here gcd(a,b) denotes Greatest Common Divisor between a and b. Garg woke up all on a sudden. He eventually realised that troll(N) will only lead him to his ultimate goal.   Now, he has N gems with each gem having power denoted by troll(i) where 1<=i<=N. Now Garg decided to multiply the powers of all the N gems. Let this value be M.   Garg chooses any particular prime factor of M and removes it. He keeps on doing it unless there are no prime factors of M left. The number of such removal operations is the secret number which will lead him to his ultimate goal.   Input First line contains T- the number of test cases. Thereafter , T lines follow . Each line contains a number N – the number of gems   Output For each test case , print the number of removal operations as mentioned above .    Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 25*10^5 1 ≤ N ≤ 3*10^7     Example Input: 1 6 Output: 7 
  The Agrawals have a habit of having repeated characters consecutively in their surnames. For example, you can find various people with surnames Aggrawal, Agrrawal, Agrawaal, etc. Mr. Abhishek Agrawal is given some strings. He tries to make the strings resemble his surname and likes it when strings have characters that repeat more than once consecutively.  More formally, given a string S of length N. He can choose a set T(possibly empty) containing indices of the string S. An index i can belong to the set T if character at the i^th index is not equal to all of its adjacent characters. Help Mr. Agrawal to find the total number of such distinct sets possible.   Input  First line of the input contains T denoting number of test cases. Each test case has exactly one line consisting of the input string S.   Output For each test case, output the answer in a separate line.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 1000 1 ≤ N ≤ 50 S consists of lowercase english alphabets     Example Input:  4 xy aaa xxyx a  Output:  4 1 4 2    Explanation  We will consider a 0-based indexed string here. Example case 1: He can choose various sets of indices including {0, 1} , {0}, {1}, {} since each position i in the set does not have they same neighboring character as itself. In total, we can form 4 distinct sets. Example case 2: He can not choose any set besides the {} (empty) set. Each index i has the same neighboring character as itself. Hence, it is not possible to include any of the index in any of the set. Hence, answer is 1.  
Three friends were going on a trip to Thailand. During their journey in flight, they were reading about a special type of function called Panda function. Panda function P(X) of a number X gives the count of positive integers less than than equal to X which divide it. Now, the air hostess saw what they were doing and decided to pose a problem to them.  She gives them two square free positive integers n and k, and she asks them to  compute  Since, the three friends are always greedy for speed, they sought out your help. You are required to give the answer to the question and help them impress the air hostess.   Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two space separated  integers n and  k    Output  For each test case, output a single line containing the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.     Constraints   1 ≤ T ≤ 130 1 ≤ n,k ≤ 10^17     Example Input: 1 2 2  Output: 3    Explanation P(2) = 2 (1,2 divide 2, therefore number of numbers which divide 2 is 2). so P(2^P(2)) is P(4) which is 3. (1,2,4 divide 4) 
 Pankaj, the right arm fast bowler bowls B regular balls and at most N free-hit balls due to his inconsistent line and length. Now, If a batsman scores 0 runs of a ball, then the ball is considered to be  a 'dot ball'. The batsman can either play a single ball bowled as a dot ball, or may score 1, 2, 4 or 6 runs from it. This scoring principle is same for both the regular balls as well as for the free-hit balls. The cricket match can end due to one of the following reasons.  Either there are no regular balls remaining (irrespective of the number of free-hit balls remaining). Or the batsman scores 100 or more runs(irrespective of the number of regular balls or 'no-balls' remaining).    The batting side wins the game if the batsman scores 100 or more runs. Also, since the batsman is a power hitter, he never plays three continuous regular balls as dot balls. Three regular balls are considered continuous even if there are free-hit balls bowled in between them. The free-hit balls although offer a good opportunity to the batsman to score runs but they are actually served as penalty on the part of bowler and hence, not taken into consideration of counting them as a regular ball. For example, if the bowler delivers the following sequence of balls i.e [regular ball][regular ball][free-hit ball][regular ball]. Then, it is not possible to score zero runs of all the three regular balls, irrespective of the runs scored from the free-hit balls between them. Find the number of ways in which the batting side wins the game. Since the answer can be too large, print it modulo 10^9 + 7.  Note  Do not confuse with actual rules of cricket like extra runs for no ball. Only the rules stated in the problem statement are valid.   Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers i.e B and N denoting the number of regular balls and free-hit balls respectively.   Output  For each test case, print the number of ways in which he can win the game modulo 10^9 + 7     Constraints   1 ≤ T ≤ 30 1 ≤ B ≤ 200 0 ≤ N ≤ 100      Example Input: 1 17 0 Output: 18    Explanation For the test case, the possible ways of winning are either scoring 6 runs out of all the 17 balls, or scoring 4 runs of 1 of the balls, and 6 runs out of the rest of them. 
Panda loves strings a lot. He has a kind of strange affinity with strings. He has been trying to solve several problems of strings for quite a while, and got stuck at one of them. The problem requires Panda to input two strings A and B each of length N and he needs to make set-A for all substrings of string A, and similarly set-B for all substrings of string B His dilemma doesn’t end here. To add the twist to the problem, a value K is also provided to Panda such that he needs to find the answer to four types of queries:- Type 1: The number of substrings of length K which are both in set-A and in set-B Type 2: The number of substrings of length K which are in set-A but not in set-B Type 3: The number of substrings of length K which are in set-B but not in set-A Type 4: The number of substrings of length K which are in either set-A or set-B but not in both  Since, Panda is a weak coder and he needs to solve large number of such queries,   help him to solve this problem.  Note The set will always have distinct substrings.  Input The first and second lines of the input contain string A and string B respectively. The third line contains an integer Q denoting the number of queries. Thereafter, Q lines follow where each line is having two values as input in the form of query. Each query can be represented as X K Where X denotes the type of query and K denotes the length of the substrings.  Output For each of the Q queries, you need to output answer on a separate line.  Constraints 1 <= |A|,|B| <= 5 * 10^4 1 <= Q <= 10^5 1 <= X <= 4 1 <= K <= min(|A|,|B|)   Example Input:  abab baba 4 1  2 2  4 3  2 4  4  Output:  2 1 0 2    Explanation You are provided with strings abab and baba. All possible substrings of A in set 1 are  { a, b, ab,  ba , aba, bab , abab }. All possible substrings of B in set 2 are  { a, b , ab , ba , aba , bab , baba }. We have four queries.  First one requires to output the number of substrings of length 2 which are in both set-A and set-B.  We have {ab,ba} as required substrings . The answer is 2.  Second one requires to output the number of substrings of length 4 which are in set-A but not in set-B. We have {abab} as required substring. The answer is 1.  Third one requires to output the number of substrings of length 2 which are in set-B but not in set-A.  As, all of 2 length substrings in both the sets are same, the answer is 0.  Fourth one requires to output the number of substrings of length 4 which are in set-A or in set-B but not in both.  We have {abab, baba} as required substrings. The answer is 2.  
 Dhoni got tired of playing cricket and thought of playing a board game involving pandas for relaxation. You are given a N * N square grid where panda pieces are placed on the borders of the board. The borders consist of only the first row, the last row, the first column and the last column. In the following figure, the border cells are the ones which are marked with X. Each of the panda piece has a unique id which is a non negative 32 bit integer.  A panda piece can move in the following way. It can move N - 1 positions either up, left, right or down and then take a 90 degree turn and moves one step further. This counts for a single move.But the move is possible only when the panda never goes out of the grid during the above mentioned process. Also, it can end up on a particular cell only if the cell is empty. Note that the movement of a panda is similar to a chess knight when N is 3. Panda pieces are placed on all the boundary cells of the square grid except one grid which is left empty. Now, Dhoni is given an initial arrangement of the board, and he is required to find whether he can attain a particular arrangement or not.  Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. "The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the dimension of the board.  The second line of the test case contains 4*N - 4 integers describing each boundary cells's panda id. ("-1" denotes the cell is empty and there is no panda piece placed at that particular cell position) The third line of the test case contains 4*N - 4 integers describing the final board configuration in the same manner. The order in which the boundary cells are described is the following. Starting from the top-most left cell, we describe the id of i^th piece of each cell situated at boundary in clockwise order ("-1" is given when that particular cell is empty).    For the above example, boundary cells are described in the order (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (2,0), (1,0).   Output For each test case, if it is possible to go from initial to final configuration, print “YES” (without quotes), else print “NO” (without quotes) in a separate line.   Constraints   1 ≤ T ≤ 100 3 ≤ N ≤ 500      Example Input: 1 3 1 2 3 4 7 6 5 -1 1 2 3 4 -1 6 5 7  Output: YES   Explanation The initial and final configurations of the grid are as follows   He moves the piece with id 7 to the empty square to achieve the required configuration.

 Chef wrote some text on a piece of paper and now he wants to know how many holes are in the text. What is a hole? If you think of the paper as the plane and a letter as a curve on the plane, then each letter divides the plane into regions. For example letters "A", "D", "O", "P", "R" divide the plane into two regions so we say these letters each have one hole. Similarly, letter "B" has two holes and letters such as "C", "E", "F", "K" have no holes. We say that the number of holes in the text is equal to the total number of holes in the letters of the text. Help Chef to determine how many holes are in the text.   Input  The first line contains a single integer T ≤ 40, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The only line of each test case contains a non-empty text composed only of uppercase letters of English alphabet. The length of the text is less then 100. There are no any spaces in the input.   Output  For each test case, output a single line containing the number of holes in the corresponding text.   Example  Input: 2 CODECHEF DRINKEATCODE  Output: 2 5

  Zucky has a frog Abby. Abby is very hungry and Zucky decides to feed it by playing a little game. Abby is a special frog which can jump as far as it wants but has a special pattern: He starts at the point 0. In his first turn, he can make a jump of 1 unit. Now for all consequent turns, if the frog is currently at a distance x (from the start), his jump will take him x units forward. Given a leaf at a distance  N , you have to find if the frog can reach that leaf or not.     Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each test case is in a separate line and contains a non-negative integer  N .   Output  For each test case, output a single line containing  True  if the frog can reach that pillar and print False  otherwise.

  There is a fest arranged in Banasthali University by Wappers. Yasha has come to the arranged stalls to eat. There are numbers assigned to each stall. Yasha visits only the magical stalls. Description of Magical stalls: Calculate the sum of squares of each digit of stall number. Continue the process while checking if this sum is 1 at any iteration, then it is a magical stall. If the sum never turns up as 1 , it is unmagical stall.     INPUT The first line contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. In each test case, first line have an integer M, denoting number of Stalls. Second line have space separated M integers such that each integer denotes the stall number.     Output For each test case output "YES" if the number is magical and "NO" if it is not in different lines.  Constraints 1<=T<=1800  1<=M<=50     Example Input:  1 3 1 2 7   Output:  YES NO YES     Explanation Example case 1. 1 is a magical number as 12=1.  2 is not a magical number as 22 =4. 7 is a magical number as 72=49  , so 42+92 =97 , so 92+72 =130  , so 12+32+02 =10 , so 12+02 =1.  
  Bhavya is here in Banasthali Campus for now ! As she stands on the roof of First department’s building, she wants to get to Mth department in her campus. But there’s a problem there ! She can go from a tall building to a shorter one by merely jumping , but can to get to a taller one from a shorter one she require ladders to climb. Find the minimum number of ladders required?  Hint : In case of jumping buildings you have to optimize your path by reducing ladders required. For getting from one to the other building of same height ladder is not required.    Input The first line contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. In each test case, first line have an integer M, denoting number of buildings. Second line have space separated M integers such that each integer denotes the height of the corresponding building.   Output Output N space separated integers denoting the number of ladders required.  Constraints  1<=T<=50  1<=M<=999999  Example Input: 2 7 4 2 3 5 6 3 8 10 8 10 8 4 2 4 6 4 8 5   Output:  3 1    Explanation Example case 1. ...  One can jump from building of height 4 to 2; but then to climb to building of height 3, an extra ladder will be required. So one can jump directly from building of height 4 to 3.From building of height 3 to 5, 5 to 6 ladders are required. From building of height 6 to 8,one first have to jump to 3 and then climb a ladder from 3 to 8.  Example case 2.  ... One need a ladder from building of height  8 to 10. From building of height 10 one can jump directly to the last building of height 5 as there is no building of height greater than 10 in between. 
  There is an exam going on in the campus and our invigilator Nidhi  is very strict. Still students manage to cheat. If one copies an array of integers from some other student, any circular arrangement of the array is valid is an answer. The first number in the answer defines the circular arrangement chosen. But in hurry student copy the numbers at wrong places. You have to calculate the cheat number ie number of digits that have been displaced from their correct position.    INPUT The first line contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Next line have an integer N. The valid array can take the form 1 to N or any of its circular arrangement. Further there are T lines each with an instance of copied array.    Output Print number of digits displaced from their position for each instance in different line.  Constraints 1<=T<=100  1<=N<=100     Example Input:  2 4 1 2 3 4 2 1 3 4   Output:  0 3     Explanation In first line, 2 is number of instances of copied array. From second line we get to know the valid arrays are 1 2 3 4, 2 3 4 1, 3 4 1 2, 4 1 2 3.In first test case the array matches with valid array so the cheat number =0. In second case first digit is 2 ,so we have to match our given array with the valid array 2 3 4 1.The digit 1 had to be on position fourth,3 had to be on second, 4 had to be on third. Thus cheat number =3.

 Icarus is super enthusiastic in becoming the best GO player in the world, and right now he is aiming to surpass his rival Troy. That is why he is training hard in many creative ways.  He knows that a great ability for a good GO player is to count the number of groups and the degrees of freedom of each one just with a quick sight.  As you know, a group is a set of stones in which each stone of the group is adjacent to another stone of the group; and the freedom degree a group is equal to the number of empty intersections that are at least adjacent to one stone in the group. In GO, adjacency is only vertical or horizontal, not diagonal. As the diagram shows, in this reduced 6x6 board there are one big white group consisting of four stones and freedom degree five (5), one black group of two stones and freedom degree four (4) and two black groups of one stone with two freedom degree two (2) each.  A good friend of him made a quick random board generator. It creates a GO board with a certain number of stones placed on it and then Icarus estimates the groups and their degrees of freedom. After that, the computer checks if he was right counting them manually. The only problem is that the computer validation has not been implemented yet, so your task is to help Icarus by writing a program that generates the correct answer. This way, Icarus will be able to validate his answers and finally defeat Troy.     Input The first line contains an integer T, which species the number of test cases. Then, T test case descriptions will follow.    The first line contains a pair of integers N and S, which specify the length of the board (which is always square) and the number of stones in it. Then, S lines will follow, each one containing the following items separated by a single white space:  A character 'B' or 'W' if the stone is black or white respectively. An integer Ci represents the column where the stone i is placed. An integer Ri represents the row where the stone i is placed.   Remember that the bottom-left intersection in the board is (1,1) and the top-right intersection is (N,N).     Output  For each board you must print the string "Case #i:" in a line, where i is the board number, starting from 1. Then, you must print one line for each group in the board, printing a character 'B' if the group is black or 'W' if the group is white, the number of stones in the set and the freedom degrees of that group; those three elements should be separated by single a white space. The groups should be sorted by the following rules:  Put black groups before white groups. If two groups are of the same color, put bigger groups first. If two groups are of the same color and the same size, put groups with greater freedom degree first.    Example Input 3 6 8 B 5 2 W 4 2 B 5 4 W 4 4 B 5 5 W 5 3 B 6 3 W 4 3 9 6 W 5 5 B 9 5 B 9 1 W 1 1 B 1 2 B 2 1 6 5 B 1 1 B 1 2 W 3 1 W 2 2 W 3 2  Output Case #1: B 2 4 B 1 2 B 1 2 W 4 5 Case #2: B 1 3 B 1 2 B 1 2 B 1 2 W 1 4 W 1 0 Case #3: B 2 2 W 3 5   Constraints:   T will be between 1 and 200, inclusive. N will be between 1 and 10^6, inclusive. S will be between 1 and min(N^2,250), inclusive. Ci will be between 1 and N, inclusive, for all i between 1 and S. Ri will be between 1 and N, inclusive, for all i between 1 and S. There will not be more than one stone in the same intersection.

   Problem description. "Pandas Don't Cry" is a semi professional band. Recently, they bought a new tour bus, which they will use to travel from one city to another for their concerts. Unfortunately they don't have much funds left now. The Band's lead guitarist is worried as to how they will pay the tolls when they move from one city to the other, as they travel a lot. He doesn't have to worry about the fuel since that is taken care of by the band's sponsors. So he decides to take a route that will cost them the least on the basis of the toll that they have to pay when they move from one city to another. Now he thinks that he only has to minimise the toll. So he decides to choose a path that will cost them the least(toll-wise). But the next concert starts in T minutes!!! He soon realises that taking the path which would cost them the least toll may not be such a good idea as the band has to reach the destination city in less than or equal to T minutes, and the path through which they will have to pay the least may not take them to their destination in that time. He has no idea how to solve this problem. He asks you for help.  Given a starting city and a destination city, tell the minimum toll that the band will have to pay to go from the starting city to the destination city.   Input  The first line of the input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases. For each of the t test cases, the first line contains the number of cities N and available time T. The first city is the city at which the band starts, the last city is the their destination city. After this line there are N lines with N numbers each, specifying for each city the travel time to the i-th city. The table is terminated with an empty line. The table of the tolls follows in the same format. In other words, each entry in row i and column j denotes the time/toll incurred on moving from city i to city j.    Output  For each test case, output a single line containing the minimum toll that the band will have to pay followed by the total travelling time.     Constraints  1 ≤ t ≤ 30 3 ≤ N ≤ 50 0 ≤ T ≤ 1000     Example Input: 1  4 10 0 9 2 3 1 0 2 4 2 1 0 2 2 2 2 0  0 1 1 3 1 0 1 2 2 3 0 9 5 2 5 0   Output: 3 3

A circular prime is a prime number with the property that the number generated at each intermediate step when cyclically permuting its (base 10) digits will be prime. Simply if all the rotational digits of a number are themselves prime It is called a prime number. For an example 1193 is a circular prime because 1931, 9311, 3119 are also prime. So according to above description first 10 circular primes will be 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 37, 79, 113. In this problem you are supposed to fine the number of circular primes below a given limit.   Important: The combination of each circular is primes are neglected when counting. That means only the lowest number is counting.   Input  The first line will contain the number of cases and the next lines will give the limit.   Sample Input 4 10 20 50 200  Output The output must contain the number of circular primes below that each given limit   Sample Output  Number of circular primes below 10 is 4 Number of circular primes below 20 is 7 Number of circular primes below 50 is 8 Number of circular primes below 200 is 12 
                     Throughout history there have been many different interesting numbers or types of numbers. One of these types is amicable numbers. Amicable numbers are a pair of numbers with the following property: the sum of all of the proper divisors of the first number (not including itself) exactly equals the second number while the sum of all of the proper divisors of the second number (not including itself) likewise equals the first number.                       The set of 220 and 284 was the first known set of amicable numbers. Pythagoras discovered the relationship and coined the term amicable because he considered the numbers to be a symbol of friendship.  For example let's show that 220 & 284 are amicable numbers:  First we find the proper divisors of 220: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, 110 If you add up all of these numbers you will see that they sum to 284. Now find the proper divisors of 284: 1, 2, 4, 71, 142 These sum to 220, and therefore 220 & 284 are amicable numbers.                               You should be able to declare a number is a amicable or not.   Number of cases will be < 10 The Input number is < 100,000   Input The first line of the input file contains the number cases followed by set of numbers one in each new line.   Output If the number is not an amicable number it should print no, if it is an amicable number it should print yes and the amicable number of it.   Example  Input: 4 1184 2620 3550 5020  Output: Yes, amicable with 1210 Yes, amicable with 2924 No Yes, amicable with 5564

Constraints  100 <= N <= 999   Example Input: 100 1000  Output: 153 370 371 407   Explanation You need to find all the armstrong numbers within given range. 
This is a simple game you must have played around with during your school days, calculating FLAMES of you and your crush! Given the names of two people, cancel out the common letters (repeated occurrence of a letter is treated separately, so 2A's in one name and one A in the other would cancel one A in each name), count the total number of remaining letters (n) and repeatedly cut the letter in the word FLAMES which hits at the nth number when we count from F in cyclic manner. For example: NAME 1: SHILPA NAME 2: AAMIR After cutting the common letters: NAME 1: SHILPA NAME 2: AAMIR Total number of letters left=7 FLAMES, start counting from F : 1=F, 2=L, 3=A, 4=M, 5=E, 6=S,7=F...So cut F FLAMES: repeat this process with remaining letters of FLAMES for number 7 (start count from the letter after the last letter cut) . In the end, one letter remains. Print the result corresponding to the last letter: F=FRIENDS L=LOVE A=ADORE M=MARRIAGE E=ENEMIES S=SISTER   Input The no. of test cases ( Output FLAMES result (Friends/Love/...etc) for each test case   Example  Input: 2 SHILPA AAMIR MATT DENISE   Output: ENEMIES LOVE        By: Chintan, Asad, Ashayam, Akanksha

Unfortunately, your army has lost a war to an intergalactic species, genetically much advanced than yours. Their captain Bruno have kept all your men (including you) as hostages, and now they are trying to have some fun. He asks each of the n people to choose any integer from 1 to n that is not taken by someone else. i.e. no two persons can have the same chosen number. Then he arranges all the n people in a circle sequentially and starts with person number 1. He leaves 1, shoots 2, leaves 3, shoots 4 .... and goes on shooting people alternately until only one person remains. He then offers the lucky man to restart his own kingdom and grants him all his looted resources. It is you who is asked first to choose your number k. What will you choose as your lucky number?   Input  First line contains T, the number of test cases. Each test case has the number n in a single line, denoting the number of people captured by Captain Bruno.     Output For each test case, print the value of k in a single line.    Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100000 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000000000000000000     Example Input: 6 6 125 32 46 98 156   Output: 5 123 1 29 69 57    Explanation  Case 1: n = 6. In the first round 2, 4, 6 are killed, 1, 3, 5 remain. In next round 3 is killed. Then 1 is killed, therefore leaving 5. So answer = 5.

 Freakin' news has recently claimed that they have discovered a civilization on mars and that they have established contact with the martians. Following is a summary of the dawn hour breakin' news on freakin' news :  Occassionally, the martian ministers feel the need to please their king. For this purpose, they give the king a trivial problem to solve and heap excessive praise upon him when he presents the correct solution.  This time they have given the king the following problem : Given two positive integers n,k and n numbers a[1],a[2],...a[n] find the maximum of (b[1]a[1]+b[2]a[2]+.....b[n]a[n]) subject to the restrictions : 1) b[i] is either 1 or (-1), for all i, 1 ≤ i ≤ n. 2) Exactly k b[i]'s are 1. The remaining (n-k) b[i]'s are (-1).  To make the task even easier for the king, the ministers have given the king the sequence a[1],a[2],...a[n] sorted in non-decreasing order.   The king, being lazy, has outsourced the task to freakin' news. Your job is to do this task for freakin' news.   Input Format :  The first line of input contains a single integer n. The next line consists of n space seperated integers a[1], a[2], ... a[n]. The sequence a is guaranteed to be sorted in non-decreasing order.   Output Format :  On the only line of output, output a single integer : the maximum of (b[1]a[1]+b[2]a[2]+.....b[n]a[n]) subject to restrictions 1 and 2.   Constraints :  2 ≤ n ≤ 100 0 ≤ k ≤ n |a[i]| ≤ 1000 The sequence a is sorted in non-decreasing order i.e. a[1] ≤ a[2] ≤ .... ≤ a[n]   Sample Input : 2 1 -4 -4   Sample Output : 0   Sample Input : 2 0 -2 5   Sample Output : -3   Explanation : 1 : There are two possibilities for the sequence b : (+1,-1) and (-1,+1). Both lead to sum 0. 2 : There is only one possibility for the sequence b : (-1,-1). This leads to the sum -3. 
  John Watson always knew that one of the favourite hobbies of Sherlock Holmes was to tinker with ciphers. Though Watson was not that good with ciphers, he learnt a few  things being with him. Right now, Watson is in trouble! He has been locked in a room and the only way to get out of the room is through deciphering a known string to get the password. With his knowledge, he finds out that a given string S can be deciphered with a given cipher array A (1-based index) of same length N as follows: Starting from first number in A (i.e. i=1) the 'i'th character in S, has to be swapped with A[i]th character in S. Help him to get out of the room.     Input  First line contains no of test cases T. The description of T test cases follows. Each test case consists of 3 lines: Length of string N in the first line, the known  string S in the second line, and N space-separated integers of array A in the third line.   Output  For each test case, output in a single line the deciphered text.     Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ A[i] ≤ N Sum of N across all the test cases in a test file will not exceed 10^6 String S contains only lower case English letters     Example Input:  3 5 abcde 1 2 3 4 5 6 fluxus 6 5 4 3 2 1 8 hrcksleo 5 5 7 5 6 8 7 8   Output:  abcde fluxus sherlock   
   Awesomeness of a string is defined by a pair of a character C and an integer F,  satisfying the following conditions :   C must belong to the  given string S and there must be a substring subS of S having length equal to F such that all the characters in subS are equal to c.   F should be as large as possible.    	Your aim is to maximize the value of F. If there are more than one c whose maximum F value is same than you need to chose the character c 	with minimum ascii value.   	For example let’s take S = abbbaaabad. subS is written in bold.   Take c = ‘a’ : Maximum possible F value is 3 (abbbaaabad).   Take c = ‘b’: Maximum possible F value is 3 (abbbaaabad).   Take c = ‘d’: Maximum possible F value is 1 (abbbaaabad).    So that awesomeness of  abbbaaabad is defined by c = ‘a’ and F = 3. First priority is to maximize the value of F (we prefered 3 over 1). If there are more than one c whose maximum F value is same then we prefer the c with minimum ascii value (we prefered ‘a’ over ‘b’).   You will be given a string and you need to find its awesomeness.   Input  Only line of the input will contain a string S.   Output  Output two lines. First line should contain value of c, whereas second line should contain value of F.   Constraints  1 ≤ length of string S ≤ 10^5  S contains only lowercase alphabets of English Language (i.e. from 'a' to 'z').   Example Input: abbbaaabad  Output: a 3  Explanation Example case 1.

 Sumo was travelling alone at night, suddenly he saw a spaceship and out of it came an alien named KK. Obviously, the alien had a different language and thus couldn't communicate readily. After some psycho-telepathic talk, Sumo realised that KK's language has M distinct characters. And a valid word in his language satisfies the following properties:   Each character in the word must be one of the M characters. There must be no  palindromic substring of size greater than 1.    For some reason Sumo wants to know the number of valid words of length N in KK's language.

  Wonderland Showroom is a a top neclace designer showroom in town . It's known for designing neclaces as customer wishes .A neclace is composed of a number of coloured beads. The colour of the beads is denoted by a lower case english alphabet for simplicity and design conventions. Alice is very fond of jewellery and wishes to purchase a "special" neclace on her birthday . Alice considers a neclace to be "special" if the following conditions are satisfied : 1. All the bead colours occurring odd number of times are placed first and then the bead colurs occurring even number of times. 2. The bead colors must also be in lexographically correct order. 3. All similar beads must occur together. The Wonderland showroom has already pre-designed neclace sets. But to ensure that Alice purchases the neclace from their showroom they need to redesign the neclaces to make it appear "special" . You are the chief designer in-charge. Can you redesign the beads to make it appear special ?  Note: String A is lexicographically smaller than string B if at the first position where A and B differ A contains a letter which is earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in B.     Input The first line contains a single positive integer T . T test cases follow. Each line of the test cases contains a string s.  Output For each test case output one line containing the "special" neclace that suits the requirements of Alice.  Constraints  1<=T<=100 1<=Length of string<=1000     Example Input: 2 abaabccd aaaabbb  Output: aaadbbcc bbbaaaa    Explanation Example case 1. The frequency of each character is as follows 1. a occurs 3 times . 2. b occurs 2 times . 3. c occurs 2 times . 4. d occurs 1 times .  We need to place the beads occuring odd number of times at the beginning and in lexographical order. 'a' and 'd' are the only beads occuring odd number of times. 'a' occurs before 'd' in lexographical order. So, we have ---> aaad Now, we need to place the beads occuring even number of times and in lexographical order. 'b' and 'c' occur even number of times So, we have ---> aaad + bbcc = aaadbbcc  
  Well, 42 is the answer to the life, universe and everything else. No wonder all other numbers want to get as close to 42 as possible. We'll call this the "coolness" factor of the number. Given multiple sequences of numbers, a number appearing in the same sequence of 42 has a "coolness" factor of 1 and those not appearing in the sequence with 42 but with another number of "coolness " factor 1 has a "coolness" factor 2 and so on. The number 42 has a "coolness" factor 0(infinitely cool).    Input The first line of each test case contains n, m and r, where n is the number of sequences,m is the number of integers in each sequence and r is the number of queries. This is followed by n lines containing m integers each each. The last line in each test case contains r integers for which the "coolness" factor must be calculated with regard to the the sequences.  Output Output should contain r lines,each corresponding to the minimum possible "coolness" factors of the numbers in the query. If the "coolness" factor cannot be determined, it should output -1 for that case.  Constraints  1<=n<=100 1<=m<=100 1<=r<=10 1<= integers in sequence <=2000     Example Input 1: 3 4 3 11 17 42 3 22 15 11 10 6 7 8 9 15 11 9  Output 1: 2 1 -1  Input 2: 3 4 2 42 19 1 6 11 13 15 17 13 16 18 15 11 19  Output 2: -1 1    Explanation Example case 1. For the first case, 11 is in the same sequence as 42 and hence has a "coolness" factor as 1. 15 is in the same sequence as 11, which has a "coolness" factor 1. Hence coolness factor of 15 is 2. The "coolness" factor of 9 cannot be determined because it does appear in a sequence containing 42, nor does it appear in a sequence, in which atleast one of the number's "coolness" factor can be determined. 
  Little Evan has a pet mouse which likes to run around a lot. One day he places the mouse on a large two dimensional grid of size n*m. The mouse is placed in the row r and column c of the grid. He finds the mouse moves in an interesting pattern. The mouse moves spirally outwards in clockwise direction from its starting position(r,c) and stops when it cannot move any further and remains in that cell infinitely. It first moves North, then east and so on. The mouse takes exactly one second to move from a given cell to its adjacent cell. Now Evan wants to know at time t, what will be the position of the mouse?  Note: The mouse never visits a cell it has already visited.        |   1     2     3      4       5 --------------------------------- 1 |              9      10    11   12 2 |             8      1       2      13 3 |             7     0       3      14 4 |             6      5      4       15  Consider the above 4*5 grid. The mouse start at the cell (3,3). The value at the position (i,j) shows the time at which the mouse will reach the cell. At time 15 the mouse reaches the cell (4,5) after which it cannot move any further and hence remains in this position for infinite time.     Input The first line of the input contains T, the number of testcases. Each of the next T lines contain 5 space separated integers n,m,r,c,t.  Output For each testcase output one line which contains two space separated integers (i,j), the position the mouse will be at time t.  Constraints Should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have. Format it like:  1<=T<=100 1<=n,m,<=100000 1<=r<=n 1<=c<=m 0<=t<=10^9     Example Input: 4 4 5 3 3 1 4 5 3 3 14 4 5 3 3 20 1 1 1 1 1  Output: 2 3 3 5 4 5 1 1    Explanation Consider the above grid for understanding testcases 1,2 and 3. 
  Ronak’s  class teacher gives him an NxN matrix.  Then, she gives him M numbers. Every number is an angle, the angle by which he has to rotate the matrix in clockwise direction.  (The angles are multiples of 90.)  Help him with the task.   Input First line consists of two numbers N and M.  The following N lines contain  N numbers each (representing the matrix).  The next M lines contain one number each, representing the angle by which the matrix is to be rotated.  Output For M problems, generate M appropriately rotated matrices, each seperated by a new line.

Stepford Street was a dead end street. The houses on Stepford Street were bought by wealthy millionaires. They had them extensively altered so that as one progressed along the street, the height of the buildings increased rapidly. However, not all millionaires were created equal. Some refused to follow this trend and kept their houses at their original heights. The resulting progression of heights was thus disturbed.  A contest to locate the most ordered street was announced by the Beverly Hills Municipal Corporation. The criteria for the most ordered street was set as follows:  If there exists a house with a lower height later in the street than the house under consideration, then the pair (current house, later house) counts as 1 point towards the disorderliness index of the street. It is not necessary that the later house be adjacent to the current house.   Note: No two houses on a street will be of the same height   For example, for the input:   1 2 4 5 3 6   The pairs (4,3), (5,3) form disordered pairs. Thus the disorderliness index of this array is 2.   As the criteria for determining the disorderliness is complex, the BHMC has requested your help to automate the process. You need to write an efficient program that calculates the disorderliness index of a street.   Input Line 1: N – The size of the array. 1 <= N <= 10^5 Line 2: N integers denoting the heights of the various buildings in order of their locations on the street.   Output Line 1: The disorderliness index of the street.  Example  Input: 6 1 2 4 5 3 6   Output: 2 
In the hidden country of Lapatrecta, an age old custom was followed to ensure that no outsider ever entered their country undetected. The security measure, though simple, was an effective one. Every person born in Lapatrecta had the initials of all his forefathers included in front of his name. Every once in a while, certain families became very famous and the initials of their ancestors were dropped from the names of all their descendants. Thus, there existed a nice homogeneity in the names of the people of Lapatrecta.  Now, a royal ball was organized at the behest of the Queen of Lapatrecta and all citizens were cordially invited to the event. The ball was being held to chop off the initials of the ancestors of the  most distinguished family of the country. The Queen set the following 2 criteria for determining the most distinguished family from amongst the invitees:   1.	The family must have more than 1 member living. 2.	The length of the ancestor list of the family must be as long as possible.   For example:   For 3 people: APJQ Ravi APJRS Rahul PJQ Bharat   The following observations hold: APJQ Ravi was of the same family as APJ Rahul but PJQ Bharat was not of the same family.   The length of the ancestor list for Ravi and Rahul was 3 whereas Bharat has an ancestor length of 0 as there is no other member of his family living.  However, if there existed a person named PJ Varun, Bharat and Varun would both have an ancestor list length of 2.   As a member of the Royal Court of Lapatrecta, you have been entrusted the task of determining the length of the ancestor list that will be chopped off by the Queen. You will be provided data in the following format:   Input Line 1: N – The number of people coming to the ball Line 2-N+1: The initials list of all the people coming to the ball. No initials list is longer than 100 characters.   Output Line 1: The length of the longest ancestor list.  Example  Input: 3 APJQ APJRS PJQ  Output: 3  
The planet of XANDOR was famous in the intergalactic empire for being home to the Carden - a race of super-intelligent computer scientists that were held in high regard for their achievements in the Intergalactic Mind Game Olympiads. The Carden decided to build a huge computer to answer questions related to Life, the Universe and Everything. They decided to use only their best two-input, noise immune, Boolean gates for this device - AND, OR and XOR. After a lot of minimization, they arrived at a variable assignment for their gates. Just then, lightning struck and erased all the parentheses from their expression. Not willing to spend the trouble parenthesizing the huge expression again, they outsourced the work to Earth.  As a consultant to XANDOR, you need to create a computer program that parenthesizes the Boolean expression in such a manner that the expression results in a true value and report the number of ways possible to do it. In case it is not possible to do so, you need to return 0.   Input An unparenthesized Boolean expression containing literals T and F which are connected via gates represented as . (dot) for an AND gate, + (plus) for an OR gate and * (star) for an XOR gate. There will be at least one literal in input line. Maximum number of literals i.e. T or F will be 15.  Output Line 1: A single value C >= 0 representing the number of true parenthesizations possible.  Example  Input: T.F+T*F  Output: 5    Description The 5 values correspond to the parenthesizations (((T.F)+T)*F), ((T.F)+(T*F)), ((T.(F+T))*F, (T.((F+T)*F)), (T.(F+(T*F))) - all of which evaluate to true. 
Modern cryptosystems rely heavily on our inability to factor large integers quickly as the basis for their security. They need a quick and easy way to generate and test for primes. Very often, the primes generated are very large numbers. You need to implement ways to test the primality of very large numbers.  Input Line 1: A number (no more than 1000 digits long)  Output Line 1: PRIME or COMPOSITE  Example  Input: 2760727302517  Output: PRIME 
A set of N dignitaries have arrived in close succession at Delhi and are awaiting transportation to Roorkee to participate in the inaugural ceremony of Cognizance. Being big sponsors of Cognizance, it has been deemed unsuitable by the organizing team to arrange for more than one dignitary to travel in a single vehicle. In addition, each dignitary has specified his preferred modes of transport to the organizing team well in advance. Consequently, the organizing team has drawn up a list specifying the set of acceptable transport mechanisms for each dignitary. Given such a list of preferences and the list of N available vehicles at Delhi, you need to specify if an allocation of vehicles can be so made that everyone’s preferences are satisfied. Each dignitary takes up atmost 1 transportation unit. Input Format: Line 1: N  - The number of dignitaries. 1 ≤ N ≤ 100 Line 2-N+1: The names of the dignitaries – 1 per line. Line N+2 to 2*N+1: The names of the vehicles, 1 per line Line N+2 onwards: K – The size of the preference list for each dignitary, followed by K space separated names of acceptable transport means. K ≤ N  Note: None of the names will have a length > 100.  Output Format:   Line 1: Yes/No.  Sample Input:  4 Divye Rohit Akshat Parth Scorpio BMW Ford Chevrolet 1 BMW 1 Ford 2 Scorpio Chevrolet 1 Ford   Sample Output:  No  
 Its time of Raksha Bandhan so its compulsory for every brother to give a gift to his sister. Brother Jon is planning to give a string S of length L to his sister Arya. After receiving the gift from her brother, Arya decided to share the string with her brother Jon. String S contains characters from index 0 to index L - 1. She will select a pivot called P ie any index P(1 ≤ P ≤ L - 1) and divides the original string into two parts. First part will contain characters from index 0 to index P - 1 and second part will contain characters from index P to L - 1. Jon will keep the first part and Arya will keep the second part. Arya is great fan of LCP (Longest Common Prefix) so she decided that she will select such an index as pivot such that LCP of the two part is high. Though she like LCP but she does not know how to calculate it. Help her to solve the problem. Arya will ask you Q questions. Each question is represented by a index P and you have to answer the LCP (Longest Common Prefix) of the two parts.  Input  First line of input contains a string S.  Second line of input contains a positive number Q representing the number of question Arya will ask you.  Q lines will follow each containing a positive number P  Output  Output Q numbers(the required answer). Each number on a separate line.  Constraints  1 ≤ Length of the string(or L)  ≤ 5 * 10^6  1 ≤ P ≤ L - 1  1 ≤ Q(number of queries) ≤ 10^6   All characters in the string will be small case english alphabets (a-z)    NOTE: C++ users, please do not use cin and cout as test cases are huge, prefer scanf and printf    Example Input: abababa 4 1 2 3 6   Output: 0 2 0 1   Explanation  For the first query, first part is a.and second part is bababa, hence LCP is 0. For the second query, first part is ab.and second part is ababa, hence LCP is 2. For the third query, first part is aba.and second part is baba, hence LCP is 0. For the fourth query, first part is ababab.and second part is a, hence LCP is 1. 
 Lanku lives in a mysterious country having N cities. In his country instead of one capital, any number of cities can be capital. There are many cities in his country, but only the capital cities have all the facilities like hospitals, markets etc. So in order to get anything you have to visit the capital city. In order to simplify it, every city has been assigned to exactly one capital city. Apart from this, every capital city has an entry fee which means that whenever a person from another city enters its assigned capital city, he has to pay some entry fee.  Consider one unit cost is used to travel one unit distance.  You will be given the location of  N cities as N integers   x1 , x2  , x3 .... , xN. You will also be provided with a positive integer K  Now your objective is to choose  exactly K cities as capital and assign every city to exactly one capital city such that following function F is minimized: C[1] = cost to travel from 1^st city to its assigned capital city + fee to enter its assigned capital. C[2] = cost to travel from 2^nd city to its assigned capital city + fee to enter its assigned capital. ..... ..... C[N] = cost to travel from N^th city to its assigned capital city + fee to enter its assigned capital. F = C[1] + C[2] + .... C[N] NOTE: If the i^th city is capital city then C[i] = 0.  Output the minimum possible value of the function F.    Input   First line of input will contain number of test cases T.   First line of each test case will contain 2 integers N and K   Second line of each test case will contain N integers which are the positions of cities in  1-Dimensional co-ordinate system.   Third line of each test case will contain N  integers which are the entry fee of the i^th city.      Output   Output will contain T lines, one for each test case.   Each line will contain one Integer which is the minimum possible value of the function F.      Constraints   1 ≤ T ≤ 10   1 ≤ N ≤ 200   1 ≤ K ≤ 35   K ≤ N   1 ≤ Entry fee, Position of cities ≤ 10^5      Example  Input 1 7 3 9 50 20 39 25 41 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7  Output: 31    Explanation  In this scenario minimum possible value of F can be obtained by: We will make city 1, 3, 4 as the capitals. Capital at city 1 will be assigned to city 1 and 7. Capital at city 3 will be assigned to city 3 and 5. Capital at city 4 will be assigned to city 2, 4 and 6. C[1] = 0 C[2] = 11 + 4 = 15 C[3] = 0 C[4] = 0 C[5] = 5 + 3 = 8 C[6] = 2 + 4 = 6 C[7] = 1 + 1 = 2  
Mikahs is fond of mathematics and his favourite topic is Sets. He boasts of his knowledge in this topic and Ramu the mathematician is jealous of Mikahs. To take him down, Ramu prepares a tough challenge for Mikahs. He first describes a new quantity for numbers discovered by him. For a number X, the product of prime divisors of X is defined as the Niceness value of X by Ramu.  For Eg. X = 36, 36 = 2^2 * 3^2 therefore Niceness value of 36 is 2*3 = 6.  Now comes his question, an array of size N is given, and 3 integers K, A and B are given. Mikahs is asked to find the number of subsets of size atmost K whose Niceness value is in the range [A, B], where Niceness value of a subset is equal to the sum of Niceness values of its elements. NOTE: Two subsets are different when they contain at least one pair of elements A[i] (in first subset), A[j] (in second subset) where i != j. For eg. For array {2, 3, 2, 4}, subsets {A[0], A[1]} and {A[1], A[2]} are different.     Input First line of the input contains N, K, A, B which are length of array, maximum size of subset required, and the lower and upper bound of the range respectively. Second line contains N space separated integers, the array elements.  Output Print the number of subsets of size at most K whose Niceness value is in the range [A, B].  Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 32 1 ≤ K ≤ N 2 ≤ A < B ≤ 10^8 Array elements are in the range [2, 10^6]     Example Input: 4 2 3 6 5 2 3 4  Output: 5    Explanation The 5 subsets are : {5} - Niceness value 5 {3} - Niceness value 3 {2, 3} - Niceness value 2 + 3 = 5 {2, 4} - Niceness value 2 + 2 = 4 {3, 4} - Niceness value 3 + 2 = 5 Thus all subsets are of size atmost 2 and their niceness values are in the range [3, 6]. 
 Vishwas is suffering from sesquipedalophobia i.e. fear of long words. Vishwas cannot tolerate a string of length greater than K. So Dhruv gave him a long string (containing only characters a,b and c) of length N to annoy him. You being his friend, came to his rescue.You cannot change the length of the string. So you came up with a plan to change some of the characters of the string such that string repeats after every K characters. In other words, now he has to only memorize only first K characters and write them N / K times to form the whole string.   For example:- abcabcabc is  acceptable for K = 3.   As changing characters is a costly process, so you have to complete the process in minimum number of changes.Now you have to output the first K characters of these newly formed repetitive string. If there are multiple answer print the lexicographically smallest string.   Input   The first line of the input contains a pair of integers N, K. N is always divisible by K   The second line contains the string containing only characters a,b and c.    Output   Print the first K characters which can be formed in minimum number of changes.Also the output should be lexicographically smallest.    Constraints  1 ≤ K,N ≤ 10^6   Example Input: Input #1: 9 3 abccbcabc  Input #2: 4 2 bacb  Output: Output #1: abc  Ouput #2: ba     Explanation  In the first case,we can make the string repetitive after K characters by making 1 change. Change the 4th character to 'a'. Hence the output is abc. Other option is to output cbc but it requires 2 changes.  
 There are N teams who are solving a problem of Insomnia 2015 Qualifier. Every team has submitted a solution and got AC :) There are two things associated with each team, score S which they have got for successfully solving the problem, and a bonus M which is a score multiplier. You are given S and M for each team i. The net score of i^th team is Si * Mi for 1 ≤ i ≤ N . You have been asked Q queries. In each query you are given a number K and you have to tell which team is on the K^th position in the rank list. The rank list holds the net score and the team number i (1 based index) and is sorted in non increasing order. If the score of any two teams is the same then the team having lesser i value is kept above in the rank list.   Input  First line of the input contains an integer N denoting number of teams. Then follow N lines, each line contains two integers S denoting the score of team i and M denoting the multiplier value of team i separated by a space. Next line contains an integer Q denoting number of queries. Then follow Q lines, each line contains a single integer K which denotes the queried rank number.   Output  For each query output a single integer containing the team number which is on K^th rank.   Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 10^4 1 ≤ S ≤ 10^6 1 ≤ M ≤ 10^6 1 ≤ Q ≤ 10^4 1 ≤ K ≤ N i has 1 based indexing   Example Input 1: 5 4 6 1 2 3 4 8 10 4 3 5 1 2 3 4 5  Output 1: 4 1 3 5 2   Input 2: 4 6 6 12 3 3 12 4 9 3 1 2 3  Output 2: 1 2 3    Explanation Example case 1.The score of 5 teams are 24 (4 * 6), 2 (1 * 2), 12(3 * 4), 80 (8 * 10) and 12 (4 * 3) respectively. So the rank list will look like Score   Team 80          4 24          1 12          3 12          5 2            2 Although two teams having number 3 and 5 have the same net score, but team having number 3 is put above than team having number 5 in the rank list as per the sorting policy. Example case 1. As the score of all the teams are same, i.e. 36 so the rank list will contain the team number in order 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 
Cars of future no longer need fuel to run, but they are fitted with special engines which can only operate in one of the two modes at a time ,either go up the road, or go down the road.  There are N towns in country. i^th town is at height H[i] (1 ≤ i ≤ N) above the sea level.  Changing mode of the car requires permissions from mayor of the town you are currently at. Mayor of i^th town charges amount C[i] (1 ≤ i ≤ n) for giving permission to change mode of the car.  These N towns are connected by R bidirectional roads. Initially no mode is set, so you need permissions to set a mode.  You have to travel from town 1 to N, in minimum amount of cost. Print minimum money required to make the travel. If it is impossible print -1.  Note:   Go up the road mode: when you are at town A and want to go to town B, where H[A] <= H[B] Go down the road mode: when you are at town A and want to go to town B, where H[A] ≥ H[B] If you continue with the same mode, you do not need to take permissions from mayor.     Input  First line contains two space separated integer N and R, number of towns and number of roads. Next line contains N space separated integer where i^th integer is H[i], height of i^th town. Next line contains N space separated integer where i^th integer is C[i], cost charged by mayor of i^th town to give permission for changing the mode. Next R lines contains two space separated integer u and v, specifying there is a bidirectional road between town u and v.     Output Print minimum cost required for travel. If it is impossible print -1.  Constraints  2 ≤ N ≤ 100000 1 ≤ R ≤ 500000 1 ≤ H[i] ≤ 10^9 1 ≤ C[i] ≤ 10^9     Example Input: 6 6 10 5 7 15 20 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 3 3 6 1 4 4 5 5 6  Output: 2    Explanation There are two paths from 1 - 6 P1: (1, 2, 3, 6) You need to pay $1 to mayor of town 1 to chose down mode. (H[1] ≥ H[2]) You need to pay $1 to mayor of town 2 to chose up mode. (H[2] <= H[3]) You need to pay $1 to mayor of town 3 to chose down mode. (H[3] ≥ H[6]) Total cost = $3 P2: (1, 4, 5, 6) You need to pay $1 to mayor of town 1 to chose up mode. (H[1] <= H[4]) You continue with the previous up mode. (H[4] <= H[5]) You need to pay $1 to mayor of town 5 to chose down mode. (H[5] ≥ H[6]) Total cost = $2 So minimum money required is $2. 
Mr. Napa, the terrorist, came to MNNIT and has attacked the Lecture Hall. He has a freeze gun and has frozen everyone there. Dassu, the super-human , came to their rescue. Dassu destroyed the freeze gun and ruined NAPA's plan. But Dassu is unable to revert people back to normal. There are 2 red buttons on the top-right block (1, M) . One is to convert all the people on that block back to normal, other is to kill all the people on that block. But the thing is only one button can be pressed and that too once. Dassu wants to save all the people and NAPA wants to kill all of them. Since no one can achieve their goal individually, so NAPA proposed an agreement. He said that both of them want everyone to be present in the top-right block. So they should begin by pushing people towards that block. The one who pushed the last person would press his/her desired button. Now the Lecture hall is rectangular and divided in blocks. There are N rows( 1 , 2 .. , N ) and M columns ( 1, 2 .. , M ). There are P people in the Hall. Now Dassu and Mr. NAPA would play turn  by turn and could select any block( with atleast one person )  and push some people(any positive number) from that block to the block up or right(but not both) of it. Now Dassu wants to know whether to play the game or not. Dassu will move first and will only play the game if Dassu can save everyone. Both Dassu and Mr. NAPA are nerds, so they will make the best possible moves.    NOTE: There may be multiple people on a single block at a time  Input The First line would contain 3 integers - N, M & P The next P lines would contain 2 integers each, the row and column number of each person.     Output "Yes" if DASSU can win the game, and "No" otherwise.     Constraints Should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have. Format it like:  1 ≤ N * M ≤ 10^18 1 ≤ N,M 1 ≤ P ≤ 10^6 1 ≤ X ≤ N 1 ≤ Y ≤ M     Example Input: 3 3 1 2 2  Output: No    Explanation The person is at (2, 2).  Possible ways to reach (1, 3):- (2, 2) -> (2, 3) -> (1, 3) (2, 2) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 3) In both the case, NAPA is making the last move. ... 
There exist a 2-Dimensional rectangular field of  infinite length and breadth. N Iron Blocks are dropped onto this field from the sky at particular coordinates. However, it is made sure that only one block is dropped at a particular coordinate. You are standing at a particular location (X, Y) of the field. You have a magnet with a power M in your hand.

Then follow Q lines, each line contains three integers X,Y and K, X and Y denoting your position and K denoting the number of blocks you need to bring to your position.      Output   Q lines containing answers to each of the queries in the input      Constraints   1 ≤ N ≤ 3000   1 ≤ Q  ≤ 100000   1 ≤ Any X or Y Co-ordinate  ≤ 10^9   0 ≤ K  ≤ 10^9      Example Input: 3 1 1 2 2 3 1 4 2 3 1 2 2 1 3 2 1 3 3 4  Output: 1 0 1 -1    Explanation  Query 1: Using a magnet of power 1, block at (2, 2) can be brought to (2, 3).  Query 2: Using a magnet of power 0, block at (2, 2) can be brought to (2, 2).  Query 3: Using a magnet of power 1, blocks at (2, 2) and (3, 1) can be brought to (3, 2).

Sruthi is looking at a spreadsheet containing N rows. Only K rows of the spreadsheet are visible at a time (If the top row is i, the bottom row will be i+K-1). In the beginning, rows 1..K are visible. Sruthi needs to read certain values from rows r1,r2...rM in that order. It is possible to scroll the spreadsheet so that the rows j..j+K-1 can be viewed instead of the current i..i+K-1. This operation counts as one scroll and its scroll length is defined as |j-i|  Find the minimum number of scrolls required so that Sruthi can read of all the M values in the given order. As there may be more than one way to do this, also find the minimum total scroll length required to do the reading in so many scrolls.   Input The first line of the input contains the integer T ( ≤ 20), the number of test cases to follow.  The description of each test case begins with a line containing 3 integers N( ≤ 10^8), K( ≤ 10^8) and M( ≤ 50000) as defined in the problem. Following this are M lines giving the row numbers from which values have to be read sequentially.   Output Output two space separated integers in a line per test case : The minimum number of scrolls required and the minimum scroll length required for the minimum number of scrolls.   Example  Input: 2 20 10 2 10 20 20 10 2 10 7  Output: 1 10 0 0  
In Dystopia, chocolates are being distributed to children waiting in a queue. The distribution proceeds as follows. Each chocolate bar is rectangular in shape with integer edge lengths. If the chocolate bar is a square, it is given away completely to the first child in the queue. Otherwise the largest possible square piece of chocolate is broken off from the chocolate bar and given to the first child. After a child receives his share of chocolate, he leaves the queue. The remaining portion of the chocolate bar is dealt with in the same fashion and the whole or a portion of it is given to the next child in the queue.  For example, if we start with a 5x3 chocolate bar, the first child in the queue receives a 3x3 chocolate bar, leaving a 2x3 bar. The second child gets a 2x2 bar while the third and fourth children get 1x1 bars. Thus four children have been fed using the 5x3 bar.  The Dystopian government has got a carton of chocolate bars to be distributed to children in the country. To make sure that maximum inequality is achieved while distributing chocolates, the chocolate bars in the carton are all of different sizes. For every i such that M ≤ i ≤ N and every j such that P ≤ j ≤ Q (where M,N,P,Q are integers) there is exactly one chocolate bar of length i and breadth j in the carton. Here a bar of length i and breadth j is considered to be different from a bar of length j and breadth i.  Given the values of M,N,P,Q find the number of children that can be fed with the chocolate in the carton.   Input The first line of the input contains the number of test cases, T ( ≤ 1000) Following this are T lines, each describing a test case with four integers M,N,P,Q separated by spaces (1 ≤ M ≤ N ≤ 100000000, 1 ≤ P ≤ Q ≤ 1000)   Output Output T lines, each containing an integer : The number of children that can be fed using the chocolate in the carton   Example  Input: 2 1 2 1 2 3 4 4 5  Output: 6 14  
Consider three distinct points A,B,C on a plane. The sum of straight line distances from A to B and B to C is always greater than or equal to the straight line distance from A to C. Equality holds only when ABC is a degenerate triangle. This is the famous triangle inequality In this case, distance between points is measured by the Euclidean metric. ie, the distance between points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) is given by sqrt((x1-x2)^2+(y1-y2)^2). However, this is not the only metric possible. Another common metric used is the Manhattan metric where the distance between the pair of points is given by |x1-x2|+|y1-y2|  You are given N distinct points on a plane where distances are measured using the Manhattan metric. Find the number of ordered triplets of distinct points (A,B,C) such that the sum of distances from A to B and B to C is equal to the distance from A to C.   Input The first line of input contains an integer T ( ≤ 10), the number of test cases to follow. Following this are the descriptions of T test cases. Each test case description begins with an integer N ( ≤ 50000), the number of points. Following this are N lines, each giving the x and y coordinates of a point (0 ≤ xi,yi ≤ 10^8) separated by a space.   Output Output T lines, each containing the number of ordered triplets of distinct points in every test case with the given property   Example  Input: 2 3 0 0 1 1 2 2 3 0 0 1 2 2 1  Output: 2 0  
Dystopia consists of N cities. There are one-way roads connecting some pairs of cities. The dysfunctional state has recently seen a lot of protests to overthrow the tyrannical ruler and the government plans to use military patrol vehicles to make sure that the protests are suppressed. Every patrol vehicle is assigned a sequence of cities. If a patrol vehicle is assigned the cities c1,c2,...ck then it starts from the city c1 and takes the direct one-way road to c2, from there it takes the one-way road to c3 and so on. Finally the vehicle takes the one way road from ck to c1. This routine is repeated everyday to keep the protestors perpetually under fear.  Now note that:  Every city has to appear in exactly one vehicle's patrol sequence exactly once  Every patrol vehicle has to move - so it has to be assigned more than one city   The government does not have any limit on the number of patrol vehicles it can use. However, they want to make sure that the least possible amount of money is spent on the patrol mission and hence they want to minimise the total distance travelled by the patrol vehicles.  Given the road network of Dystopia, find the minimum total distance the patrol vehicles need to move so that all the cities can be patrolled. If it is impossible to organise a nationwide patrol with the given constraints, report the same.   Input First line of the contains T, the number of test cases (T ≤ 10) This is followed by the descriptions of the T testcases. The first line of the description contains two integers N and R, the number of cities and one way roads respectively (N ≤ 200,R ≤ 10000). The cities are numbered 1,2,3,...N This is followed by R lines, each representing a one way road by 3 integers N1, N2 and D : the start city, the end city and the length of the road respectively ( N1!=N2, 1 ≤ D ≤ 1000000). You are assured that there is no more than one one way road from any N1 to N2  Output For each test case output one line. If the patrol can be done, output the minimum total distance that the patrol vehicles have to travel. Otherwise output Impossible   Example  Input: 2 3 3 1 2 1 2 3 1 1 3 1 4 6 1 2 2 2 3 2 3 4 2 4 1 2 1 4 1 3 2 1  Output: Impossible 6  
The acid manufacturing company has a special room to store leaky acid containers. The container holders in the room, which have the capacity to hold one leaky container each, are arranged in a rectangular grid of R rows and C columns such that the columns are in the North-South direction while the rows are in the East-West direction. Currently there are N leaky containers in some of the holders and M more have just arrived and need to be placed in the holders.  The company has realised that the containers being produced these days are exceptionally leaky. So much so that the acid that is leaking is corroding the holders completely.  Every acid container leaks either in the North-South direction or the East-West direction. Containers can be rotated by 90 degrees and thus a container that is leaking in the East-West direction can be made to leak North-South and vice versa. Given enough time, a leaky container can corrode the holder completely and start corroding the two adjacent holders in the leak direction and this process can go on.  The company employee has to make a decision fast. He needs to rotate some of the existing containers and place the new containers in proper holders and directions such that the total number of holders that will be corroded is minimised.  Find out the minimum number of holders that will be corroded after proper placement of the new containers and proper orientation of all containers.   Input The first line of the input contains the number of test cases T ( ≤ 10).  For each test case, the first line has four numbers R, C, N and M (1 ≤ R,C ≤ 100, 1 ≤ M,N ≤ 20, M+N ≤ R*C). This is followed by N lines, each giving the location and leak direction of an existing container by 3 integers r (row number), c (column number) and d (1 if leakage is N-S, 0 if E-W). Numbering of rows and columns begins with 1.   Output For each test case, output on a different line the smallest number of holders that will get corroded after rotating the existing containers and placing the newly arrived containers.   Example  Input: 2 4 6 4 4 1 2 0 2 4 0 3 2 1 3 5 1 50 50 5 10 1 35 1 17 44 0 17 46 1 42 35 1 42 46 0  Output: 12 148  
An arithmetic progression is a sequence of numbers a1, a2,... an such that ai+1-ai is equal for all 0≤i<n. This difference is called the common difference of the arithmetic progression.  Now consider a sequence of arithmetic progressions A1 = (a1,1, a1,2,... a1,n1), A2 = (a2,1, a2,2,... a2,n2),... Ak = (ak,1, ak,2,... ak,nk)   A progressive progression is such a sequence with the additional properties that:   ai,ni = ai+1,1 for 1 ≤ i < k  ci, the common difference of Ai, is a positive factor of ai,1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ k  ci<ci+1 for 1 ≤ i < k  ni >1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ k  k ≥ 1   Find the number of progressive progressions such that a1,1k,nk = N. As this number can be quite large, output it modulo 100000007.   Input The first line of input contains T (≤ 100), the number of testcases. This is followed by the description of the testcases. The description of each testcase consists of a single integer N (1 < N ≤ 1000000).   Output For each testcase, output modulo 100000007 the number of progressive progressions such that a1,1k,nk = N   Example  Input: 2 5 10  Output: 1 6 
Sheldon and Lenard are a pair of nerds playing an unimaginatively named game, "Move the books". The game board is an infinitely long strip of cells numbered 1,2,3.... from left to right. On certain cells, their favourite physics books have been placed. A player's move consists of taking any one of the books and moving it to any cell which lies to its left. But there is a constraint that you are not allowed to make your book jump over a cell that contains a book already (ie, You cannot move a book from cell j to cell i < j if there is a cell k which contains one or more books such that i < k < j). However, you can place a book into a cell even if it contains one or more books already. But books that are placed in a cell are stacked in the order in which they arrive and hence only the topmost book (the last arrived one) can be moved from there. The players make moves alternately, and the person unable to move any book loses.  They have been playing the game for a long time. Sheldon makes the first move in all the games and wins most of the time. Lenard is fed up and wants to make the first move. However, Sheldon doesn't yield and this leads to an argument. This is the final agreement they have come up with:   They start with N books placed in different cells. The arrangement is computer generated and hence there is no player role in this step  Lenard picks two natural numbers a & c while Sheldon picks a natural number b. Both are unaware of the number(s) the other person has chosen while choosing their own number(s). Three more books are now added to the set : a cells to the right of the rightmost current book, b cells to the right of this book and c cells to the right of the latter book.  They start the game with the same rules as earlier, with Sheldon making the first move.   Now Lenard feels that there might be certain pairs (a,c) such that independent of which number Sheldon chooses, Lenard is assured to win the game. Given the initial configuration of the board find all such pairs, sort them lexicographically [(a1,c1) < (a2,c2) iff a1 < a2 or (a12 and c1 < c2)] and output the Kth such pair. If there are less than K pairs with this property, output Impossible   Input The first line of the Input contains T (≤50), the number of test cases. Following this are the descriptions of the T test cases  The first line in the description of each test case contains two space separated integers N (≤1000) and K (≤10^8). Following these are N lines, each containing the location of a book. The book positions are given in increasing order and will each fit in a 32 bit signed integer.   Output For each test case output the Kth lexicographically smallest pair of integers that will assure Lenard a win. The two integers should be separated by a space and pairs for each test case should be output on a new line. If for any test case there are less than K pairs of integers that assure Lenard a win, on the line for that test case output Impossible   Example  Input: 1 1 1 1  Output: 1 1 
Phileas Fogg and Passepartout are now going on a road trip in their brand new car. They start at location A0 and need to go to AN. Their car has a capacity to hold only C units of fuel and can travel unit distance on unit amount of fuel. They start by filling some amount of fuel from the filling station at A0. On the way, there are several filling stations A1, A2,... AN-1. The cost of fuel is not the same at all filling stations. Find the minimum amount that they have to spend on fuel to make the journey.  Note that it is assured that the journey can be completed with the car of the given capacity.   Input The first line of input contains T (≤10), the number of test cases.

This is followed by N lines, each containing an integer. The integer on the ith line is the distance from A0 to Ai and is ≤ 10^8. The distances are in increasing order. This is followed by N more lines, each containing an integer. The integer on the ith line is the cost of one unit of fuel at the filling station Ai-1 and is  ≤ 10^8.   Output Output one integer per test case, the minimum total amount that needs to be spent on fuel to complete the journey   Example  Input: 2 5 10 10 20 30 40 50 1 2 1 2 1 5 15 10 20 30 40 50 1 2 1 2 1  Output: 70 60 
The Dystopian government has installed a giant fountain in front of the parliament building. The fountain consists of N levels stacked one on top of the other and is situated on top of a large tank of infinite capacity. The levels of the fountain are numbered 1 to N from top to bottom. The top l1 levels are identical with capacity c1, the next l2 levels identical with capacity c2,... the final lK levels with capacity cK. Here l1 + l2 + ... lK = N.  When water is added to level i beyond its capacity, the excess water overflows to level i+1. Water overflowing from level N is collected in the tank. Water is added to the levels in the following fashion. First, w1 amount of water is added to each level i such that s1 ≤ i ≤ e1. Then w2 amount of water is added to each s2 ≤ i ≤ e2... Finally wM amount is added to sM ≤ i ≤ eM. Note that water might be added to the same level multiple times in this fashion.  You have to find out the amount of water that has overflowed to the tank at the bottom, and the total number of levels of the fountain that are completely filled   Input The first line of the input contains T (≤10), the number of test cases. Following this are the descriptions of the test cases. The first line of the description of a test case contains space separated integers N (≤2x10^8), K (≤2000) and M (≤10^4). Following this are K lines, each containing a space separated pair of integers. These are the (li,ci) pair as explained in the problem statement. Here l1 + l2 + ... lK = N and ci ≤ 10^8. This is followed by M lines, each containing a space separated triplet of integers. These are (si,ei,wi) as explained in the problem statement. 1 ≤ si ≤ ei ≤ N and wi ≤ 10^6  Output For each test case output a space separated pair of integers : The total amount of water that has overflowed to the tank and the number of levels of the fountain that are completely filled.   Example  Input: 1 10 2 1 5 6 5 3 3 9 5  Output: 5 5 
Unlike Dystopia, the neighbouring nation of Utopia believes in economic development. To improve the economy of the nation, the Utopian government has decided to select some pairs of cities as sister cities and take steps to improve trade relations between each pair.  There are N cities in Utopia, numbered 1 to N. There are two-way roads  connecting some pairs of cities. The total number of roads in Utopia is R. Now the road network in Utopia has been created efficiently so that there is no road that is redundant. That is, there is exactly one way to travel between any pair of cities without using the same road twice. Now when a pair of cities is chosen as sister cities, the government wants to make sure that there is a direct road between them. Also, a given city cannot have more than one sister.  Given the road network of Utopia, find the number of ways of selecting K pairs of sister cities under these constraints. As the answer can be quite large, output it modulo 100000007.  For example, assume that there are 6 cities in Utopia. There are direct roads between the following pairs of cities : (1,2), (2,3), (2,4), (4,5), (4,6). Notice that  there is exactly one way to travel between any pair of cities. If the government wants to select two pairs of sister cities, it can do it in four ways : {(1,2),(4,5)}, {(3,2),(4,5)}, {(1,2),(4,6)}, {(3,2),(4,6)}   Input First line of the input contains T (≤10), the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test cases. The description of each test case begins with a line containing 3 space separated integers N (<400), R (<10000) and K (<400). Following these are R lines, each representing a road in Utopia. The line will contain two different space separated integers N1 and N2 implying that there is a two way road between N1 and N2. You are assured that the road network has the property as described in the problem statement.   Output For each test case, output modulo 100000007 the number of ways of selecting K pairs of sister cities satisfying the conditions in the problem statement.   Example  Input: 2 3 2 1 1 2 2 3 6 5 2 1 2 2 3 2 4 4 5 4 6  Output: 2 4 
A skier wants to ski down from the top of a mountain to its base. There are several possible routes, using different slopes enroute, and passing through some flat areas. The effort expended in skiing down a slope depends upon the length of the slope and the speed of skiing. For each slope, there is a maximum advisable speed. The skier wants to use a toute that minimizrs the average effort spent per unit distance traveled (i.e. the total effort expended divided by the total distance traveled).  The flat regions on the mountain are numbered 1 to N from top to bottom. The skier begins at level 1 and needs to reach level N. You are given the numbers of the flat regions each slope connects. Note that on a slope, one can only ski downwards. For each slope, you are also given the length of the slope and the maximum advisable speed for it. The effort expended in skiing down a particular slope is given by the following formula:  e = d*(70-s) if s ≤ 60, and e = d*(s-50) if s > 60  where e is the effort required, d is the distance traveled and s is the speed of travel.  You have to determine the minimum average effort per unit distance that the skier has to expend in order to reach the mountain base, while staying within the maximum advisable speed at every slope.   Input The first line of input gives the number of test cases T(≤20). This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases For each test case, the first line of input gives the number of flats, N (N ≤ 1000), and the number of slopes, R (R ≤ 20000), connecting them respectively. Each of the next R lines describes a slope by giving: the numbers of the flats at the top and the bottom of the slope, the maximum advisable speed for the slope (≤ 100), and the length of the slope (≤ 1000) respectively.   Output For each test case, output a single number (with four places after the decimal point, rounded up) that gives the minimum average effort per unit distance that needs to be expended to ski down from the mountain top to the base. The output for each test case should be on a separate line.   Example  Input: 2 4 5 1 4 30 60 1 2 50 40 1 3 60 20 2 4 60 50 3 4 50 50 3 3 1 2 50 40 1 3 40 20 2 3 20 30  Output: 14.4445 30.0000 
Place-name game is a favourite pastime among the few children that go to school in Dystopia. The game is played as follows : One player says the name of a city and the next player has to say the name of a city that begins with the last letter of the said city. The game then goes on.  Dystopian cities recently went through a massive renaming. Now each city has a name that begins with a consonant and ends with a consonant.  Anaximander is a student with a very poor knowledge of geography. Hence he fares very poorly in the game. He has recently come up with a new idea. He would just remember the name of 21 Dystopian cities. He wants to choose the 21 cities such that there is exactly one city name starting with each consonant and exactly one city name ending with each. This would give him a good advantage in the game, whether he is playing first or second.  Given the names of the N cities in Dystopia, find out the number of ways Anaximander can select 21 city names out of the lot satisfying the properties. As this number can be very large, output it modulo 100000007.   Input The first line of the input contains N (≤1000), the number of cities. This is followed by N lines, each containing the name of a city in Dystopia. Each city name will begin and end with a consonant, and will contain at least 2 and at most 10 letters.   Output Output modulo 100000007 the number of ways Anaximander can choose 21 city names out of the N with the intended properties.   Example  Input: 23 BBBB CCCC DDDD FFFF GGGG HHHH JJJJ KKKK LLLL MMMM NNNN PPPP QQQQ RRRR SSSS TTTT VVVV WWWW XXXX YYYY ZZZZ BAAC CAAB  Output: 2 
 You are a young spy in the army of the Jedi, posted on the outer rim of the Tatooine. You learn that Darth Vader’s army is on the way to attack the Planet. You want to save Tatooine and you need help of the Jedi Council to defeat the army of Darth Vader. To seek Jedi help you have to inform the Jedi Council sitting at the Jedi Temple which is very far from where you are. You have a pod with you which runs on electricity and you would like to use it to travel to the Jedi Temple. But the battery of your pod lasts for only a fixed amount of time, C. There are many service stations on your way from the outer rim to the Jedi Temple and luckily for you, some of these allow you to recharge your pod’s battery. You are in a hurry and want to reach the Jedi Temple in as little time as possible. If you are late, then it might be impossible to save the peaceful planet of Tatooine from the dark forces of Darth Vader’s army. Given the time needed to travel between the service stations, you are asked to output the minimum time in which you would be able to reach the Jedi Temple.  Input The first line of each input contains four space separated integers, N M P C where  N: The number of service stations including 0 for the starting point and N-1 as the location of the Jedi Temple. M: The number of 1-length paths existing between pairs of N service stations P: The number of service stations which allow you to recharge your battery C: The maximum time for which your battery runs, after you had charged it completely   The next line contains P space separated integers denoting the service stations which allow you to recharge. This is followed by M lines, each containing three space separated numbers X Y T where T is the time required to travel between X and Y Assume that the initial charge in the pod is 0 and it takes negligible time to recharge your battery at the service stations (After all, being in Jedi army has its perks ;) ).  Output Output a single integer t which is the time required to travel from your initial position to the Jedi Temple. If it is not possible for you to reach the Jedi temple, print -1.  Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 300 1 ≤ M ≤ min(n*(n-1)/2, 5*10^4) 1 ≤ P ≤ N 1 ≤ C ≤ 10^7 0 ≤ X ≤ N-1 0 ≤ Y ≤ N-1 0 ≤ T ≤ 10^4   Example Input: 6 5 2 250 0 4 0 1 200 1 2 30 2 3 10 3 4 10 2 5 230  Output: 500 
 Bob is extremely bored, so he thinks of a game to play in the meanwhile. The game is as follows. He takes two integers N and M and tries to find twice the sum of the quotients of the integer division of (i * N) by M varying i from 0 to M-1 both included. But as he started computing the sums for larger values of M and N, things started becoming very complex. So he has asked for your help. You need to output the sum that Bob needs.  Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each of the next T lines contains two space separated integers M and N.  Output For each test case, output a single line containing the answer.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ M,N ≤ 10^8   Example Input: 1 2 3  Output: 2  
  In the present world, Operating System is one of the most important tool. Its a big business and a lot of profit is generated by the operating system developers depending on the features they have implemented in their OS, which are demanded/required by the users. In one such instance, an operating system developer IOPC (International Operating Product Creators) developed a special type of operating system for their users. Their operating system had the following structure: The user is initially given a root directory, and the user is allowed to create new directories. Every time he creates a new directory, he must create a link between the new one and exactly one of the existing directories making sure that the new directory is accessible from the root directory. This structure gave them special features like there is only one way to move from one directory to another directory through the links created. For ease of debugging, they named their directories with integer values. Their product created a new revolution in the market. However, in a short time, another operating system developer Copycat Operating Systems (CCOS) launched a very similar OS with exactly the same features. Although the OS manual of the new product in the market had different numbers assigned to their directories. But IOPC detected foul play and are convinced that CCOS have stolen their code and just made some minor changes in it and presented it as their own. Since, you are one of the top programmers in the world. They have asked for your help to resolve this issue. After sufficient study, you have reached the conclusion that if the internal structure of the file system of two operating systems match after performing a certain set of operations on both of them, then they are the same. So, to ease your work, you have designed a test suite for this verification purpose. Your test contains performing some operations on both the operating systems and see what links are formed in each of the file systems. However, due to shortage of time, you forgot to ensure that the test suite performs the tests on both the operating systems in the same order. However, you are able to get the generated links and the root directory of the operating systems. Given this information, you have to print whether the Copycat Operating Systems have actually copied from IOPC or they just got lucky in developing a similar system.  Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description for each of the test cases starts from a new line. The first line of input for each test case contains an integer N, the number of directories (including the root) generated in the file systems of both the OS by the test suite. Next, follow descriptions for the file system (root and links structure) for both the operating systems, one after the other, each beginning from a new line and each containing N lines. The first line for each of the OS, contains an integer  R, the integer corresponding to the root. The next N-1 lines describe the link structure with the i^th line containing two space separated integers Ai Bi meaning that there’s a link between the directories with integer names Ai and Bi.  Output  The output must contain as many lines as the number of test cases T. For each test case print 1 if both the operating systems generate structurally same file systems (root and link structure) of directories when operated upon by the test suite, otherwise print 0.  Constraints  T ≤ 3 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 0 ≤ Ai, Bi, R ≤ N-1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ N-1   Example Input: 1 2 0 0 1 0 1 0  Output: 1     Note:  This problem will be tested on Cube (Pentium G860 3GHz)  
  Ted (the popular talking bear) has been given a job at the printing firm. Looking at his previous employment record, the firm is watching very strictly on his work product. Recently, he has been assigned a task to print on a square sheet of dimension NxN. You may think of the sheet containing N^2 cells of dimension 1x1 each. Since, Ted is a lazy bear, he somehow steals two stamps, a horizontal printing stamp which covers a 1*2 block and a vertical printing stamp which covers a 3*1 block. He may use these two stamps in any order and as many times as he wants. But the sheets are old, if the sheet is stamped twice at any cell, it will tear off. Now, there is a shipment of sheets coming with varying sizes. But he observes that in some of the cases it is not possible to completely fill the square sheet with no overlapping stamps. So, he asks for your help in deciding whether it is possible to fill the square sheet with the stamps without any overlapping.  Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T, denoting the number of sheets in the shipment. It is followed by T lines each containing a single integer N denoting the side of the square sheet.  Output  For each test case, output a single line containing “YES” (without quotes) if it is possible to fill the square sheet without overlapping the stamps and “NO” (without quotes) otherwise.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 5*10^5 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6   Example Input: 1 2  Output: YES  
  The war between the Jedi’s and the Empire Battle Droids is at its height. Master Yoda, bored from this war, wants to end this as soon as possible, while using minimum Jedi powers. To discuss the battle plans, he calls a meeting of all the Jedi Masters at the Jedi Temple. There, the Jedis start meditating and get connected to each other using telepathy. To maximise their power, they enclose a closed region using these telepathic connections. Telepathy is a tricky business, the Jedi’s can somehow connect to each other with the shortest distance possible in real world.  The droids somehow come to know of this meeting and plan to kill the Jedis in the Temple. But as they approach the Temple, the Jedis become aware of their presence. Master Yoda doesn’t want to waste precious Jedi powers on these droids. He asks each Jedi warrior how much power would he need to use in order to kill each droid.  To calculate the power needed to kill a droid, a Jedi cuts himself from the other Jedis and observes if a droid is inside the telepathic region, so formed. If the droid falls inside it, the power required to kill him is equal to the manhattan distance between the Jedi and that droid. If not, the power required is equal to the square of Euclidean distance between them. Master Yoda decides to launch an attack before its too late, so he assigns each Jedi a particular drone to kill such that the total Jedi power required by them is maximised.  Input The first line contains a single integer N, which denotes the number of Jedi Masters (=Number of Empire Battle Droids) The next N lines contain two space separated integers X Y, the location of the Jedi Masters. The next N lines contain the two space separated integers X Y, the location of the battle droids.  Output A single integer K denoting the maximum total Jedi power that is required.  Constraints  5 ≤ N ≤ 350 1 ≤ X,Y ≤ 1000   Example Input: 5 2 1 3 2 3 4 1 4 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 1 4 3 4 1  Output: 41  
  Ned is quite bored in class. As he is very interested in Mathematics, he decides to develop a new number system which he would name after himself. Unlike the other “traditional” number systems, his system does not have “low-level” relationships like successors, predecessors etc. Rather the system is modeled in such a way that it has entities represented by numbers which are related via very complex classes and a mathematical relation R. The relation R is symmetric i.e. if  a R b , then  b R a but is not transitive.  He then asks his arch-rival Ted to solve a problem in this number system. The problem is to find a subset of a given set of N entities which satisfies the following property.  For every element a in this subset, the number of distinct elements in the subset which are related to a with the relation R is at-least K.  Ted, being a phony, runs to you for help. Help him in finding such a subset.  Input  The first line of input contains three space separated integers, N, the number of distinct entities, M, the number of different class relations and K, the size of this subset. Each of the M lines that follow contains two integers a and b, meaning that a and b are related by relation R.  Output  For each test case, output a single line containing an integer S, the size of such a maximum subset. If such a subset is not possible, output 0.  Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ M ≤ min{n*(n-1)/2, 5*10^5} 1 ≤ K ≤ N 0 ≤ a,b ≤ N-1   Example Input: 3 3 2 0 1 0 2 1 2 Output: 3  
 Alice has been recruited as a new Professor at IIT Kanpur. There are a total of n+1 students in her class each having a unique rank in the range 0 to n. Each student gives a choice of having nCr assignments (r is the unique rank of that student), where nCr is the coefficient of the r^th term in the expansion of (1+x)^n. Alice loves her students so much that she wants her students to learn and do as many assignments as possible. She has gone crazy and thus she wants to give the minimum number (K, the same for all students) of assignments to each of her student, where K is divisible by the number of assignments requested by each of her students. She asks you for help. Help her to find the number of assignments she needs to give. As the answer can be very large, output it modulo 10^9+7.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. This is followed by T lines each containing an integer n.  Output One line for each test case, giving the number of assignments (K) Alice needs to give to her students.  Constraints  T ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5   Example Input: 3 1 4 5  Output: 1 12 10  
 Master Yoda is teaching a young Padawan learner, an IIT Kanpur student, the knowledge and powers of a Jedi. During his training, one of the tasks he has to accomplish is to fly a starship across a 3D maze created by Master Yoda for his training. The maze is filled with virtual droids of the Empire’s Army at certain cells. The student has to fly the starship across the maze such that at no time the starship is in the same cell with any of the droids, otherwise he will fail the test and will be kicked out of the Jedi Training Camp. Description of the maze: The Maze is a 3-D grid of size (N+2) x C x D. It is a vertical stack of D layers where each layer is a 2-D grid containing N+2 rows and C columns. The first (index 0) and the last (index N+1) rows of each layer are filled with ‘O’ (open positions in the Maze), except that one cell in the first row of some layer will be marked ‘S’, the starting position of the student and his starship, and one cell in the last row of some layer will be marked with ‘D’, his destination. Every other cell in this grid will either contain an enemy droid marked with ‘X’ or an empty space marked with ‘O’.  The starship has an intelligent R2D2 robot installed which guides the student in flying the starship and deciding his path. The configuration of the grid is stored in the memory of R2D2. It is well known that Master Yoda is a very strict teacher when it comes to Jedi training. He has already computed the minimum number of moves it will take the student  to fly from the starting point and reach the destination already feeded in R2D2. Master Yoda realised that if the drones in the maze are kept static, it is too easy for R2D2 to plan a path. Thus, Yoda decides to use his Jedi powers to set the Maze in motion, moving certain rows and columns of all the layers, to add some difficulty to the task. But he won’t move the first and the last rows of any layer (which keeps ‘S’ and ‘D’ positions static), since that will be too much for a young Padawan learner, only the masters practice in such a grid.   As soon as the Young Padawan Learner (IITK student) starts the flight, Yoda sets the maze in motion. In each layer, the rows with indices 0 and N+1 remain stationary. For the first layer (the bottom-most layer which is index 0), the row with index 1 is moved towards the right 1 cell at a time (i.e. one cell to the right in each move). The row with index 2 moves to the left, row with index 3 to the right and so on. For the rest of the layers, each row (except rows with indices 0 and N+1) move in the direction opposite to that of the row just below. All the rows move one cell at a time (i.e. one cell in each move). The row motion is modular i.e. whatever position (‘X’ or ‘O’) leaves the corner of the maze on any side, comes back in the same row, the same layer on the other side.  Description of the motion for the starship: At all times, the starship must remain in the 3-D Maze of dimensions (N+2) x C x D. In each move, the starship may stay in its current cell or may move to the cell just adjacent to it, i.e. the starship may move one cell either to its right, or to its left in the same row, or one cell up or down in its column, or one cell up to the layer stacked above it or one cell down to the layer underneath keeping the row and columns indices the same. The motion of the starship isn’t modular unlike that of the rows. Although, the starship can’t share a cell with any droid at all times, it may jump over an approaching droid in the same row. It means if a droid is in the neighbouring cell of the starship, in the next move, both of them can exchange their positions without the student failing.    Input  The first line of the input contains an integer M denoting the maximum number of moves allowed. The next line contains three space separated integers N C and D denoting the dimensions of the Maze. The next N+2 lines contain C characters denoting the layer 0 of the Maze The next N+2 lines contain C characters denoting the layer 1 of the Maze . The next N+2 lines contain C characters denoting the layer D-1 of the Maze  Output Output an integer denoting the minimum number of moves needed to reach the destination. If it is not possible to reach the destination in less than equal to M moves then output -1  Constraints  1 ≤ M ≤ 4000 1 ≤ N ≤ 100 1 ≤ C ≤ 100 1 ≤ D ≤ 10   Example Input: 20 2 3 1 OOS OOO XXO OOD Output: 5  
 The Triwizard Tournament was established roughly seven hundred years ago as a friendly competition amond the wizarding schools viz., the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the Beauxbatons Academy of Magic and the Durmstrang Institute. Held every five years, the competition would be hosted by each school in turn, the judges for the Tournament comprising the headmasters and headmistresses of the schools.  The last Triwizard Tournament ended with many sad memories. To honour the memory of  all those who were lost in the last tournament, it has been decided that Hogwarts will be hosting the Triwizard Tournament again this year. Professor Dumbledore wants to introduce a new event this time. This event was suggested to him by Hermione Granger. In this event, a dear friend of each of the champions would be left blindfolded in some cell of the Dungeons, beneath the Hogwarts Castle. This friend has to start from the cell where he/she was left and come out of the Dungeons while walking through other cells and corridors he/she finds on his/her way. If he/she is unable to come out, then he/she would be consumed by the snakes hiding in the dungeons. Description of dungeons: Dungeons can be viewed as a graph in which the cells of the dungeons are the nodes and the corridors between the cells are the edges of the graph. The time needed to cross a path is the weight of the edges of the graph. To add to the difficulty of the task, no magic is allowed inside the Dungeons. Thus, the friend of any champion would need to rely on his/her instincts and luck. It turns out that when you are in a cell of the Dungeons, the best strategy for escape is to randomly choose an edge to one the neighbouring cells. This way, you can increase your chances of escaping the Dungeons. You are asked to report the expected time one would take to escape the Dungeons starting from the initial cell where he/she was left. Assume that the friend uses the escape strategy as described above.  Input The first line of the input contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains four space separated integers N M S E where  N: Number of cells in the dungeons M: Number of edges between the pairs of cells S: The Starting Cell E: The Destination Cell  This is followed by M lines each containing three space separated integers X Y W which denotes that W is the time required to cross the corridor from cell X to cell Y and also from cell Y to cell X.  Output A single line for each test case which contains a single floating point number K, the expected time to come out of the dungeon. K must be rounded upto 6 places after the decimal.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 25 2 ≤ N ≤ 200 0 ≤ S,D,X,Y ≤ N-1 1 ≤ W ≤ 100  Assume that it is always possible to escape the Dungeons, i.e. you can always reach D from S.  Example Input: 2 2 1 0 1 0 1 42 3 3 0 2 0 1 1 0 2 2 1 2 3  Output: 42.000000 3.333333  
  Alice is teaching a class of N+1 students and she is planning a picnic for her students. Each of her students is given a distinct rank between 0 and N for identification which makes sure they don’t get lost during the picnic. She has brought with her many bags each completely filled with N^2chocolates. She wants to distribute them among her students. But, like every other teacher, she is not going to give them without making them do some math problems first. So, she asks each of her students to choose a number k equal to his/her rank, and do the following :   Find out the number of ways of selecting k chocolates from a set of N distinct chocolates.  Add his/her rank to N to get N’ and again find out the number of ways of selecting k chocolates from a set of N’ distinct chocolates.   She will give each of her students x * y chocolates, where x is the number that the student computed in the first step and y is the number computed in the second step. Now after calculating how many chocolates she will give in total, she starts taking them out from her bags. She picks a completely filled bag at first and starts taking out chocolates out until the bag is empty. Then, she chooses another completely filled bag and follows the same procedure. She wonders how much chocolates she will have to remove from the last bag.  As a programmer, she asks for your help to find out the number of chocolates she will have to remove from the last bag.  Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Next follow T lines each containing an integer N for the test case. Assume that N is guaranteed to be a prime number.  Output  For each test case, output one line containing the number of chocolates Alice needs to remove from the last bag.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ N ≤ 31113   Example Input: 1 2  Output: 1  
  Princess Leia is trapped in Alderaan. C3PO and R2D2 get in the country to save her. There are bombs kept at various locations which C3PO and R2D2 have been able to figure out. They don’t know where Princess Leia is, therefore they decide to dispose all the bombs off to ensure her safety. But as they have already used most of their strength in figuring out where the bombs are, they don’t have much strength left and want to dispose all the bombs by moving as less as possible. So they decide to split. They can start at any of the bombs’ locations, but unfortunately the bombs have been programmed such that if a bomb i is diffused after a bomb j with i < j then the i^th bomb and all the other remaining bombs get detonated; thereby killing the princess. Though R2D2 and C3PO have split, they can still communicate with each other. R2D2 uses his analytical skills to figure out a way in which they should proceed, but it is not optimal. You need to help them in saving the princess by minimizing the sum of the total manhattan distance R2D2 travels and the total manhattan distance C3PO travels. You need to output the minimum sum over all possible ways in which they can diffuse all the bombs.   Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. First line of each test case is the number of bombs N. Each of the next n lines contains three space separated integers, where the i^th line contains xi yi zi, the coordinates of the i^th bomb.  Output  For each test case output a single line containing the minimum sum of the total manhattan distance R2D2 travels and total manhattan distance C3PO travels in order to dispose all the bombs off.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 5 ≤ N ≤ 1000 0 ≤ x,y,z ≤ 5000   Example Input: 1 3 2 3 4 0 4 5 3 4 1  Output: 4   Explanation C3PO starts at (2,3,4) and R2D2 starts at (3,4,1). C3PO first diffuses the bomb 1, then it moves to (0,4,5) to defuse bomb 2 then C3PO diffuses bomb 3. So the total distance they need to move is 4. 
  The Department of CSE, IITK tried a new experiment by giving M algorithmic assignments to students in groups of size N. Students are allowed to divide an assignment into parts such that each part is solved by a different student. It must be noted that a student may do atmost one assignment at a time. Also, an assignment can be attempted by exactly one student at a time, it may not be the case that two different students be solving different parts of the same assignment at the same time. Here at IITK every student is believed to have the same potential. The professors estimated the total number of student hours each assignment will require. Now as the student calendar is filled with a lot of interesting activities, this makes it difficult for the students to be always available for an assignment. Most of the times, they are involved in doing many interesting activities e.g., many of them must be participating in IOPC 2013 right now :)  The Department knows that the students of CSE, IITK are very competent and have knowledge of when an assignment will be put up, how much student hours it requires and  the deadline of the assignments. The Professors must know that the students here are very moody. So, it is possible that a student gets bored of solving an assignment for a long time, leaves it in the middle to pick another assignment without wasting any time. The student may later come back to the earlier assignment or may ask one of his friends (of the group of N students) to solve it.   Your task is to help the Professors figure out if this experiment of theirs would be a success. In other words, figure out if it is possible for the group of N students to finish the given M assignments by the deadline.  Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases First line of each test case contains two integers N the number of students  and M the number of assignments given to the group. The next N lines contain two integers S and E denoting the start and end time at which the student is free to solve his/her assignments. The next M lines contain three integers A, D and H denoting the start time of the assignment, the deadline of the assignment and the expected student hours needed to complete the assignment respectively.   Output  For each test case, output a single line containing “YES” (without quotes) if  it is possible to complete all assignments by their deadline and “NO” (without quotes) otherwise.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 120 1 ≤ N,M ≤ 50 0 ≤ S,E,A,D,H ≤ 10^7   Example Input:  1 2 2 1 5 3 4 1 5 3 2 4 2 Output: YES  
  A group of students thought of creating a different VOIP network. The network, rather than being any general graph, was a tree. Every user was assigned a unique userid. This network was hierarchical, i.e there was an admin. The parent of a user is the user connected to it on the unique path when it calls the admin. All users had a parent user except the admin.  All was working fine, until a weird problem occurred in the network. It so happened that a user was only able to call his parent user. Every user (including admin) was unable to reach any of his children. Although we can see that some users can still send a message to other users. A user u can't call the parent g of his parent p (i.e. his grandparent g) but still he can send a message to his grandparent g. u can achieve this by calling p and asking p to call g and send u's message to g.  Your task is to tell, given the userid x and userid y, whether x will be able to send a message to y.   Input  The first line of the input contains two space separated integers N, the total number of users (including admin) in the VOIP network and Q, the number of queries. The next line contains the userid U of the admin. Each of the next N-1 lines contains two space separated integers x and y indicating that user x is the parent of user y. Next in the input are the queries you need to answer. There are Q lines each containing two space separated integers x and y.  Output  For each query output a single line containing 1 if x can send a message to y -1 if y can send a message to x 0 otherwise  Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ Q ≤ 10^5 0 ≤ U ≤ N-1 0 ≤ x,y ≤ N-1   Example Input: 3 2 1 1 2 1 0 0 1 0 2  Output: 1 0  
 Every programming contest has a problem on factorials. Continuing with this tradition, we decided to include one too. Given two integers, n and p, find x (mod p) where x is the number obtained after eliminating all powers of p from n!. Here n! denotes factorial of n.  Assume that p is prime.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. This is followed by T lines each containing two space separated integers, n and p.  Output One line for each test case, giving the value of the required expression.  Constraints  T ≤ 10 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 1 ≤ p ≤ 10^7   Example Input: 1 5 3 Output: 1 
  It is a very bad time in the North. Lord Eddard Stark has been killed, the castle has been destroyed and Lady Catelyn is not in the kingdom. To add to the difficulties, “Winter is Coming”. The kingdom of North is composed of houses and roads connecting these houses.  Winters in the North are very harsh and it becomes almost impossible to leave your house. So, this time, the King in the North has devised an intelligent plan of converting some of the existing roads into tunnels, so that people can walk freely inside them and move from any place to another place i.e. for each house there is a path to every other house through the tunnels. For this he hires some builders to complete this task. All of them submit a plan. The king has to decide which builder to give the contract to.The King will choose the contractor which submits a plan with the minimum cost. Now you need to tell whether the King can decide and choose one of the contractors deterministically or not.  Input The first line contains two space separated integers N M where  N: The number of houses M: The number of roads  The next M lines contain three space separated integers A B R each, which denotes that cost of constructing a tunnel between houses A and B is R. Assume that the tunnels are bidirectional.  Output  One line containing “YES” (without quotes) if the King can choose deterministically otherwise "NO" (without quotes).  Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ M ≤ min(2*10^5, N*(N-1)/2) 0 ≤ A,B ≤ N-1 1 ≤ R ≤ 10^9   Example Input: 4 4 0 1 100 1 2 5 1 3 70 2 3 1000  Output: YES  
 Students’ Gymkhana, IIT Kanpur has started horse-racing games as a refreshment activity in the campus where the students can take part in horse racing on evenings and weekends. But since everyone is very busy with their academics and upcoming Techkriti, they have decided to outsource the organisational responsibilities of the races to a company. But unfortunately, the company people are very corrupt. The take bribes from people to place their horses already ahead of the starting line before the start of the race. As a neutral observer, you are given the task to find out which of the N horses taking part in the race would be leading at a given time in the contest. The horses are indexed  from 0 to N-1.  Input The first of the input contains T, the number of test cases. The description of each test case begins on a new line and is as follows:  two space separated integers N, the number of horses and Q, the number of queries. N lines for the horses indexed from 0 to N-1 in order, each containing 2 space separated integers D and S; where, D is the initial distance of the horse from the starting line and S is its speed. All the horses run uniformly at their individual speeds. Q lines each containing an integer t, which is the query time.   Output For each query time t, output a line containing a single integer which is the index of the horse leading at that instant of time. If two horses are leading together at that time, print the index of the horse which will be ahead a split second later.

  21st century is the internet century. Most part of our life revolves around the internet which keeps people so busy with their work, that they don’t have enough time to find suitable dates for themselves. To help people with this, there is a startup which takes the preferences of people and arranges suitable dates for them.  To avail this service, girls and boys need to register on their website. Girls give their preferences for their dates among the boys registered on the site. The site then randomly generates pairs of a boy and a girl and sets them on a date. The website chooses a match such that everyone has a date while ensuring that every girl has exactly one boy as her date and every boy has exactly one girl as his date.  There may be a few girl-boy pairs who may never be matched together by the startup while trying to find exactly one match for everybody. You are asked to output all such girl-boy pairs.  Input The first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains three space separated integers, N1 N2 M where  N1: The number of girls N2: The number of boys M: The total number of preferences the girls give  The next M lines are such that each contains two space separated integers A B which means that the girl A would like to date boy B.  Output For each test case, in the first line print P the number of girl-boy pairs who will never be able to date, followed by all the pairs, each in one line. Each pair will be output as two space separated integers, i j, where the i^th girl would never be able to date the j^th boy. All the pairs must be reported in the lexicographic order; i.e. report pair i j before k l, when i < k or when i = k and j < l.

Input The first line contains a single integer T, which denotes the number of test cases. Each test case begins with a line containing two space separated integers N and M, where N and M are the number of vertices and the number of edges, respectively. The next M lines each contain two space separated integers X and Y, which denotes that there is an edge between vertices X and Y.  Output A single line per test case containing an integer which denotes the number of free subtrees in the corresponding graph. Since the answer can be very large, output it modulo 10^9+7.

In a class of B students, the teacher wishes to distribute N! [ Factorial(N) ] oranges, such that each one of them gets equal number of oranges. The teacher, being a lazy person, wants to give away oranges such that she has to take minimum number of them back with her.

In the kingdom of Baratheons, there is a strict hierarchy in the army. The leader of the army is the king under whose command are a set of soldiers. Each soldier commands a certain section of army, that is there are certain soldiers under him who may be commanding some more soldiers, and the similar hierarchical structure is followed downwards, till the lowest rank of soldiers. Note that if soldier A commands soldier B and B commands C, then C also comes under the purview of A, however it will be said that B is under the direct command of A and C is under the direct command of B. Also note that each soldier has a unique hierarchical path to the king. The army commission, a different body, may decide to give certain units of power to a particular section of the army. To do this, the commission gives K units of power to the soldier commanding a section, which is cloned and each soldier under his command, including himself, receives K units of power. Remember, initially all soldiers have zero units of power. In times of war, a team of soldiers may be selected from across sections. The team is selected in the following way: given two soldiers A and B, all the soldiers in the path through the hierarchical structure from A to B, are included in the team. For such a team, you have to calculate the total power of the team.  Input Format First line contains three space separated integers N, K and R. N represents the number of soldiers R represents the id of the king. Next N-1 lines describes the hierarchical structure. Each line consists of two integers A and B, signifying that soldier B is under the direct command of soldier A. K following lines represent operations of the following types.For a query operation, the first character is Q, followed by two space separated integers X and Y.For an update operation, the first character is U, followed by two space separated integers S and T, such that the soldier S is given T units of power to be cloned and distributed to soldiers under his command.  Output Format For each query operation, output the total power of all soldiers in the path through the hierarchical structure from X to Y.  Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 1e5 1 ≤ K ≤ 1e5 1 ≤ X,Y,S ≤ 1e5 Absolute(T) ≤ 1000    Sample Input 5 3 1 1 2 1 3 3 4 3 5 U 3 5 Q 4 5 Q 4 1  Sample Output 15 10  Explanation Initially all soldiers have 0 power. When the update operation is executed, soldiers 3, 4 and 5 get 5 units of power. For the first query, all soldiers in the path from 4 to 5 are added up, i.e, power(4) + power(3) + power(5) = 15, is given as output. For second query, all soldiers in the path from 4 to 1 are added up, i.e., power(4) + power(3) + power(1) = 10, is given as output. 
You are given n points in 2 D plane. Let us represent the n points by p[1],p[2],....p[n]. No two points have same coordinates and no three points are colinear. Consider the set of lines L = {L : L is a line segment made by connecting (p[i],p[j]) for all 1 ≤ i,j ≤ n and i!=j} Two line segments L1 and L2 are said to be related if they intersect at a point which is not an end point of either of segments. A set of lines L is said to be a ”super” set if it does not contain any two line segments which are related. Now you wonder what could be the maximum possible size of a "super set" which belongs to L  Input Format  The first line contains an integer T, representing the number of test cases.    For each test case, first line will contain a single integer N. Then the next N lines, will contain two space separated integer x[i] and y[i].    Output Format  The output consists of T lines, each line corresponding to a test case. For each test case, output the maximum possible size of a "super set".

 With the advancement of technology, humans have designed and developed a large variety of machines to do their work. The machines can not only do the work much faster than any human but with supreme accuracy. The defence systems of a country have also moved on to using some machines or computer programs to predict and prevent any attacks to the nation. This time, one of the final year students at IIT Kanpur this year has been asked by the President during his last visit to program an intelligent machine, to help the defence forces of India against a terrorist attack. The defense forces of India have gathered top secret intel that the terrorists may try to attack some of these particular cities to affect the flow of water streams from those cities to other cities inside the country to create havoc in the normal day to day life of the citizens. Some of our soldiers by risking their life have gathered the information that the terrorists have been using to plot such an attack. They have recovered a file which contains the map of cities that the terrorists have, the water streams following between them and possible target locations and their corresponding cities that they want to affect. The defence forces are interested to know if the terrorists will in real be able to disturb the water flow at some city that they want to affect by attacking its corresponding target city. The defence forces also know a encoding strategy of the terrorists. They know that if some attack planned by the terrorist to disrupt flow from city A to city B is not possible than reverse disruption, i.e., from city B to city A is possible.  The student is asked to program a machine which will take this file recovered from the terrorists and output for each of the terrorist plan, whether it is possible or not. The file consists of entries of two kinds, and is a model with a total of N cities. Each city is provided with a unique number from 1 to N. The water streams can originate at some city and can end at some city. Also, all the water streams entering at a particular city combines at that city and may flow out to multiple other cities. Note that the nature assures that no water stream can move in any circular fashion. Any city is affected by an attack on a city if:  It is the attacked city itself. It is receiving water directly from the targeted city It is receiving water from any other affected city  The two kinds of entries in the file are as follows:   The first kind of entries are denoted by U and are followed by two integers (x y, the unique identifiers of 2 cities) which means that water directly flows from the city x to city y. The second kind of entries are denoted by Q followed by two integers x and y, meaning that the terrorists are planning to attack city x in hope to disturb water supply at city y  The file provided to the student, the same one the defence forces acquired from the terrorists is a mix of these two types of entries. The terrorists, trying to be smart, have mixed up these entries i.e. they can have entries of type U and then Q and then U again and so on. The defence forces know that this file is authentic. They want to know for each entry of type Q for cities a and b (i.e. the terrorists aim to attack city a to disturb water at city b) whether the terrorists can do so, or not. The defence forces have also identified a trick in these entries which is if it is not possible to disturb b by attacking a, it is possible to disturb a by attacking b. And if this is the case, the terrorists have inverted the order of cities in the subsequent entries of kind U. That is, if the entry Q A1 B1 results in Not possible, than the following entries U A2 B2 denotes a direct flow from B2 to A2. Note that if another following entry Q results in not possible, then the order in the following U entries is reversed again, i.e., it returns to the original order.  Help the student to program such a machine to figure out the terrorists plan.  Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases is given below The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of cities in the file. Then follows the file acquired by the defence system. Each line is one of the following:  U a b U followed by two space separated integers a and b, meaning the file mentions that there is a direct water stream from city a to city b.   Q a b Q followed by two space separated integers a and b, meaning that the file mentions that the terrorists are interested in attacking city a to disturb water stream at city b.  END A string "END" (without quotes), denoting the end of this test case.      Output  For each entry of the form "Q a b", print "YES" (without quotes) if it is possible to disturb water stream at city b by attacking city a, otherwise print "NO"(without quotes) in a separate line.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ N ≤ 4000 1 ≤ a, b ≤ N The total number of lines in any test file will be bounded atmost 500000   Example Input: 2 5 U 1 2 U 2 5 Q 5 1 U 4 3 U 3 2 Q 1 4 Q 5 2 U 1 4 Q 1 5 END 3 U 1 2 Q 1 2 Q 2 1 U 2 3 Q 2 3 END  Output: NO YES NO YES YES NO NO     Explanation First a flow is established from city 1 to city 2 and from city 2 city 5. After that, for Q 5 1, since there is no flow from city 5 to city 1, answer is "NO", and following U entries are reversed. Then, flow is established from city 3 to city 4 and from city 2 city 3. For Q 1 4, since there is a flow from 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4, the answer is "YES". Similarly the rest of the queries and updates are handled. 
In planet Krypton, the people use concalls to communicate with each other. The concall network is composed of concall devices connected to each other. The network is such that from each concall device, there is a unique path through the network to reach every other concall device. An Edit: Note that, the connection between any two concall devices, if connected, is two way. The network has a parameter R, constant for it throughout its use. Every concall device has some value associated with it, which is initially zero. General Zod, a militant leader, knows that the concall network is the lifeline of the society in the planet and so wishes to slowly poison it. To do this, he introduces nanomites in the network, through a state-of-the-art program. Whenever he runs the program on devices A and B, then all devices in the shortest path from A to B have their value incremented by a certain amount by the nanomites. The amount incremented of nodes in the path is in arithmetic geometric series, i.e., if the shortest path is A, V1, V2,.....,B, then value of A is incremented by XR^1, value of V1 is incremented by 2XR^2, value of V2 is incremented by 3XR^3 and so on. The value of X can be different for every program run by Zod while the value of R is fixed for the network, as specified earlier. After having run the program to change the values in the specified way of multiple devices in the network, General Zod wishes to make some queries of the values of the network to assess the correctness of his program. He wants to know that, given two devices C and D, what is now the sum of values of devices in the shortest path from C to D. Since this value may be very large, you have to report it modulo 100711433.  Input Format First line contains two integers (N and R respectively) separated by space. In the next N-1 lines, each line contains two integers A and B, such that there is a direct connection between A and B. Next line contains two space separated Integers (U and Q respectively) representing the total number of Update and Query operations to follow. Next U lines follow each line asking to increment the value of certain nodes in the above specified way. Each line contains 3 space specified integers, X, A and B, where  X is the parameter for the program and A and B are the devices, such that values of all devices between A and B are to be updated. Next Q lines, each line containing two integers C and D.  Output Format Output the answer to each query as explained.  Constraints  1 ≤ R ≤ 10^9 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ U ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ Q ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ X ≤ 10^9    Sample Input 5 2 1 2 2 3 2 4 1 5 2 2 3 3 4 3 2 5 3 4 2 5  Sample Output 108 126  Explanation Value of R is 2. After first update the values of device 3 becomes 6, device 2 becomes 24, device 4 becomes 72. After second update values of device 2 becomes 24+6=30, device 1 becomes 24, device 5 becomes 72.  For first query operation, Value[3] + Value[2] + Value[4] = 108 For second query operation, Value[2] + Value[1] + Value[5] = 126  
Santa and Banta are buddies. Santa has a good sense of humour, but Banta is unable to or partially understands some jokes. Now Santa has with him N jokes he wishes to tell to Banta. Due to lack of time, he cannot tell all of them and has to choose R jokes for Banta. The total value of all the jokes he tells Banta is Fibonacci ( ^N C R ). Note that, Fibonacci(1)=Fibonacci(2)=1 and Fibonacci(n)=Fibonacci(n-1)+Fibonacci(n-2) for n > 2. However, Banta is unable to comprehend all the jokes. The value of jokes he understands is the total value of all jokes Santa tells Banta modulus some value M. Given N, R and M, your job is to compute the value of jokes Banta understands.  Input Format First line contains T ,number of test cases to follow. Next T lines follows, each line containing 3 space separated integers, N, R and M.  Output Format The output contains T lines, each having the value of jokes Banta understands.

In an exam in IIT Kanpur, the question paper consists of infinite questions. Ram, being a studious guy, aims to attempt infinite questions. In the i-th question, Ram answers are worth R[i] marks. However, he does not know the answer to all, and instead of thinking about the questions, repeats his answer after every S questions, i.e., the answer given by Ram for the K-th question is same as the answer for (K - S)-th  question and so the marks obtained for question K and question K-S are also the same. Shyam, on the other hand, hardly studies and has made up his mind to attempt atmost N questions. He plans to copy the answer to these questions from Ram. If Shyam wishes to write answers to all between question X and question Y, he wants to know the corresponding answers by Ram for all questions between M and M+Y-X, where M is a parameter decided by Shyam. For each answer copied, he would earn same marks as Ram earned for the corresponding answer. If at the end of the exam, Shyam has not attempted any of the N questions, he receives zero marks for that question. Now while correcting Shyam's answer sheet, the teacher wishes to check answers for questions between A and B. She asks Ram as what would be the maximum marks he would obtain if she checks some continuous questions in between A and B. Help Ram in answering these questions and passing the exam.

The Fiendish Bombers, unleashed by Emporer Terrorin, have invaded Bungeling Empire in Bomber Nebula. You are Dr.Ein, the scientist assisting the Bomberman. Help him to save Planet Bomber! Consider the Empire as (N+2)x(N+2) maze free of any rocks and obstacles. The Fiendish Bombers have reached the borders of the Empire. They are present on all border cells of the maze except the corners (they don’t like to be cornered :P). Now consider the remaining NxN maze. Some cells are with counter-explosive devices and so bombs cannot be planted there. The bombs can be planted anywhere on the remaining maze. Because of one of the new invention, the Fire, ability of the Bomberman’s bomb is infinite. That is, if it explodes at (a,b) it will destroy enemies from all the cells on the horizontal line through (a,b) and on the vertical line passing through (a,b). Note that it would not affect any of the counter-explosive devices. You have an encrypted connection with the Bomberman and can message him (a,b), the coordinates where a bomb can be planted. The cost of each message is M. But the problem is, you forgot to agree upon the directions of the axis while deciding the origin.  So, when you message (a,b), Bomberman plants 2 bombs - on (a,b) and on (b,a) (provided they are distinguishable). Also, it is ensured that there is a counter-explosive device on (a,b) if and only if there is a counter-explosive device on (b,a). Your task is to minimize the cost of eliminating all enemies. Print a single integer, the cost of eliminating all the 4*N enemies. Print IMPOSSIBLE if it is impossible to do so. Input    There are several test cases.  Each test case begins with two integers:  N - denoting size of the grid and M - denoting cost of single message.  N lines follow. Each containing a string of N characters describing the cells of corresponding row. “#” denotes cell with counter-explosive device and “.” denotes free cell.

Problem Description In the world of Mathematics, there are ordinary numbers and there are special numbers. The special numbers are Transformers. The transformers are of two types - Autobots and Decepticons. Autobots have the task of saving the number-kind from the evil intentions of Decepticons. A number C is said to be equivalent to another number D if C%k = D%k, where k is a given parameter. The Transformers are called so because of their special ability to transform to something else. Now, given a value Q, a transformer N wishes to transform to another value P such that P is equivalent to Q.However, like all mortal beings, they too have restrictions, they can only take some particular transformations. The following transformations are allowed N -> N + a N -> N - b N -> N * c N -> N % d You have to report minimum number of steps to transform to such a value P (which is equivalent to Q) using the above transformations, or print -1 if it is impossible to do so.

It is commonly implemented as % operator in many programming languages. All test cases are generated randomly.  
Rob likes to explore but is lazy. He has many cubes arranged before him in a line. Each cube has either the letter 'A' or 'B' inscribed on it. Now Rob wants to swap any two positions of cubes placed on the line, such that the there exists a sequence of continuous cubes with letter 'A' inscribed on them, whose number is greater than or equal to M. However, mechanically swapping cubes is a tedious task. Therefore he wishes to know the minimum number of swap operations he has to perform to get such an arrangement of cubes.

There are multiple parallel universe and one can traverse from one to another using the method of inception. A universe is reachable from another only if they are connected by an "inception line", and for two universe not connected by a direct "inception line", one might have to traverse multiple intermediate universe before reaching the destination universe. You are assured there will be exactly one path from any universe to any other. However there's another catch for the people planning to traverse between different universe. Every universe has a time factor associated with it. Given two universe A and B with a direct "inception line" between them, assume A has a time factor S and B has a time factor T, then a job J in A will be slowed by a S ^ T  factor in B. Similarly if from B, one moves to another universe C, directly connected to it, having time factor V, then the job will be slowed down by a factor of S ^ ( T ^ V )   in C, and so on. Note that it may appear contradictory to common sense, but thats how things in parallel universe are. You will be given the data of all universe with the connectivity information between them. Your task is, given two universe P and Q, to report the factor by which the job will be slowed down, when one traverses from P to Q. Since this factor can be very large, you will have to report it modulus some value, which will be given in the input. Also the time factor may have to updated and such an operation will also have to be supported. However, there will be atmost 5 update operations.  Input Format First line contains two space separated integers, N and K.The next N-1 lines contain the connectivity information. Each line contains two space separated integers P and R, representing there is an "inception line" between P and R. Next line contains N space separated integers, where the i-th integer is the value of the time factor for the i-th universe. Following K lines contains the operations to be performed, each line representing an operation. For a query operation, the first character is Q, followed by three space separated integers A, B and C. For an update operation, the first character is U, followed by two space separated integer D and E, such the the time factor of universe D is to be changed to E.

Third query operation represents (2^2^2) mod 10000 = 16 Fourth query operation represents (2^2^3) mod 10000 = 256 
Mr. Devu Singh has a farm. The farm is represented as a matrix, divided into rows and columns, with each element being equal to 1, if the corresponding area in the farm contains a tree, and 0 otherwise. Every element in the farm can contain atmost one tree. Mr. Devu Singh loves his farm. However, Devu Singh has a short memory. He cannot remember which of the elements in the farm has a tree in them. What he does remember is the total number of trees in each row and each column, but is not sure about this information either. He wishes to know, that for such constraints, whether there exists a matrix satisfying these constraints. If there does exist such a matrix, output the lexicographically smallest one, otherwise output -1. For lexicographically comparing two matrices A and B, you write the matrix A and B as a string of 0/1 by writing in row major order (ie, first write first row, then second row and so on upto n-th row.). Now lexicographically compare the two strings generated in this way.  Input Format First line contains T : number of test cases. For each test case, first line has N and M. Next line contains N space separated integers where i-th one represents sum of the i-th row. Line after that contains M space separated integers where i-th one represents sum of i-th column.

Devu is a freshman in the college. In the data structures course, he has recently learned about LCS (longest common subsequence) problem, He thought about this problem a lot and has finally come up with a challenge for you. You are given a string S of size N consisting only of lowercase English letters ('a' to 'z'). You have to find minimum length of string V also consisting of lowercase English letters('a' to 'z') such that length of LCS (S, V) ≥ L. The string V should not have more than K consecutive equal characters.Note that it is not necessary for string V to be composed of characters of S only.  Input  First line contains T : number of test cases.   For each test case, You are given two lines.  First line contains a string S.  Second line contains two space separated integers K and L.   Output  For each test case, output a single line containing integer corresponding to the answer of the problem.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10^6 1 ≤ Size of string S ≤ 10^6 1 ≤  Sum of lengths of strings over all test cases ≤ 10^7 1 ≤ K, L ≤ Size of S   Example Input: 2aa1 1aba1 2 Output: 12 Explanation  For first test case, V is 'a'.   For second test case, V can be 'ab' or 'ba'.  
Once upon a time, Bob  decided to say ‘Hello’ to Alice. Knowing that Alice had a soft corner for bicyclists, he took out his bike and decided to cycle to Alice’s home. Now, the hometown of Alice and Bob - the MathLand, is a very scenic location, hidden somewhere in the Himalayas.  Bob being a lover of scenic sights and integer sequences, rated scenery of roads on a weird scale of first 6 Super Awesome Numbers, viz. 3,4,6,12,16,18. Whenever at any crossroad C, Bob selects a road i having rating R(i) with probability P(i/C) = R(i) / (∑(R(j)) where summation is over all j roads from C (including the road from which he reached crossroads, irrespective of the location of Alice’s home). Bob proceeds thus, till he reaches Alice’s home. After meeting Alice and saying ‘Hello’ (and having a delicious pudding made by Alice, but miraculously all of these taking 0 time!), Bob heads back home in similar fashion.  There are N crossroads in MathLand. Alice’s and Bob’s home are near(at) 1st and Kth crossroads respectively. All roads in MathLand are bidirectional. Between any two given (distinct) crossroads, there is atmost 1 (direct) road. The time taken to travel from crossroad i to crossroad j is given by Tij. Now MathLand is situated over mountains of Himalayas and Bob is driving a bicycle, so because of slopes, the time taken to reach crossroad i from j on the road connecting them need not be same as that of j to i (though the rating of roads is same for both directions). Your task is very simple. You have to find the expected time of this ‘outing’ of Bob.  Input Format  There are several test cases. Each test case beginning with a single line containing 3 space separated integers - N,M,Q denoting number of crossroads, number of roads in MathLand and Q possible locations of Alice’s home. M lines follow, each containing 5 space separated integers U,V,R,Tuv,Tvu, denoting a road, its rating and ‘to-and-fro’ timings. Q lines follow, each containing a single integer K, denoting the location of Alice’s home. File ends with a single line containing N=M=Q=0 which should not be processed.   Output Format  For every test case output a single line denoting case number. Then Q lines, each denoting the time for each K of that case. Print this expected time, rounded to exactly four places after decimal point. Note that, atmost an error of 1e-3 is tolerated by the judge.  Print INFINITE if this expected time of reaching Alice’s home or coming back (or both) is infinite.   Constraints   N ≥2  Sum(N) over all test cases <= 50  0<= M <= MIN(100,(N*(N-1))/2)  0<= Q <=N  R ∈ {3,4,6,12,16,18}  1<= U,V <=N  1<= Tij <=1000  1<=K <=N    Sample Input 4 2 3 1 2 3 2 1 1 3 3 3 1 1 2 4 0 0 0  Sample Output Case #1: 0.0000 7.0000 INFINITE  Explanation Explanation of Test Case#1: When K=2, Expected time of 1 -> 2 travel: S_12 = ½(2) + ¼(6) + ⅛(10) + 1/16(14) + 1/32(18) + … Solving this AGP, S_12 = 6 Expected time of 2->1 travel: S_21 = 1(1) = 1 So, expected time of the complete outing = S_12 + S_21 = 7 
 Allen Rusk is building Latex. Latex is a modern typesetting software which will be known for its letter AI. Note that Latex is a modern software and supports way more than 26 letters. The letter AI consists of a database of letter pairs with a hit-rate and type associated with every pair. Since Latex is in beta stage, there are only two types of letter pairs right now: Modern and Rustic. Today Allen is testing Latex. Each test starts with a Test-Sum TS set to 0 and Type-Sum PS set to 0. The test consists of N phases where N is the total number of distinct letters available to him. For the first phase he chooses a random letter and writes it down. For each subsequent phase, he chooses a letter R which has not been written down and also that there exists a letter L which has been written down and the letter pair L R exists in the AI database. He also adds the hit-rate of L - R to his Test-Sum TS. Also, if the letter pair is Modern, he adds 1 to his Type-Sum. At the end of each test he checks his Type-Sum. X is his lucky number. Hence if the Type-Sum is equal to X or N - 1 - X, he notes down the Test-Sum for this test. Allen doesn't have much to do today, and he spends the whole day testing Latex. So much so that he exhausts all tests that are possible with the given Letter AI database. Finally, he finds out the minimum among all the Test-Sums he noted in the entire day. However, this has been tiring for him and he wonders whether he can find out the Minimum Test-Sum given just the AI database. Can you?     Input  First line containts a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.  First line of each test case consists of 4 space separated integers N, M1, M2, X where N is the no. of distinct letters, M1 is the no.of pairs in AI database with type as Modern, M2 is the no. of pairs in AI database with type as Rustic and X is the lucky number. Next M1 lines for Modern type contains 3 space separated integers L, R, H denoting that pair L, R have type modern and hit rate H Next M2 lines for Rustic type contains 3 space separated integers L, R, H denoting that pair L, R have type rustic and hit rate H    Output  For each test case, output a single line containing the minimum test sum TS that he obtained with type sum equal to X or N - 1 - X. If there doesn't exist any such test print -1     Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 50 1 ≤ N ≤ 200 1 ≤ M1 + M2 ≤ 600 0 ≤ X ≤ N - 1 1 ≤ L, R ≤ N 1 ≤ H ≤ 100    Sample Input: 1 5 3 2 1 1 2 1 2 3 1 3 4 1 4 5 1 3 5 1 Sample Output: 4 
Ilya lives in the beautiful city of Bytes lying in a hilly terrain. She loves to ride her bicycle on the hills whenever she gets a chance to do so.  There are check-posts located on the hill at a unit distance from each other. The height of the check posts is given in an array A. Ilya has to visit her aunt who lives N check-posts away. Being a hilly area, the terrain in between the check-posts is either monotonically increasing or decreasing. She is initially standing at checkpoint indexed 1. However, Ilya suffers from a rare sleeping disorder in which she goes to sleep while riding her bicycle if the terrain is uniform. She wakes up whenever there is a change in nature of terrain i.e from increasing to decreasing or from decreasing to increasing. You have been given an easy task of counting number of times Ilya wakes up during her sleep as she passes through these N check-posts falling on the way to her aunt's house.   Note  You can safely assume that the terrain between i^th and (i + 1)^th checkpoint will be uniform i.e it will have either increasing slope or decreasing slope.  It is guaranteed that no two adjacent check-posts have same heights.      Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The first line of the test case consists of an integer N denoting the number of check-posts. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of check-posts. The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the heights of check-posts falling on the way.     Output  For each test case, output a single integer denoting number of times Ilya wakes up from her sleep in a separate line .     Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤  10 2 ≤  N ≤  10^5 -10^9 ≤  Ai  ≤ 10^9     Example Input: 2 3 1 3 2 5 1 2 3 4 5 Output: 1 0  Explanation Example case 1. She wakes up when the height  changes from 3 to 2 Example case 2. She never wakes up in between the sleep 
  !doctype>  Problem statement Henry, a graduate research assistant, is doing research on the properties of Fibonacci numbers. He is overloaded with work from his Professor and could make use of some automation. He requests you to write a program which would tell him whether or not each number from the sample data, which he provides, is a Fibonacci number of not. Write the program for him.  NOTE: Fibonacci numbers are numbers of the sequence which follows the recursive formula An = An-1+An-2 where A1 = 0 and A2 = 1 (initial conditions).   Input The first line contains T the number of test cases. The T lines follow with each line containing a single integer F.   Output For each test case, ie., for each number F, display whether or not the number is a Fibonacci number. Each test case output should occupy its own line. Print "YES" if it is a Fibonacci number else print "NO" (Both without quotes).   Constraints 1 ≤ T ≤ 100000 0 ≤ F < 2^64   Sample Input 2 34 1233   Sample Output YESNO   Explanation  34 is the 10^th Fibonacci number. 1233 is not a Fibonacci number.    
On a Planet where people are obssessed with Numbers, they have human definitions for relation among Numbers. In one such case, they have designated a father number to be a number formed by the sum of the child number's digits along with the child number itself. For example, for number 481, (4+8+1+481=)494 is the father. It is of course evident, every son will have a father, but a person (number) may have any number of children, even zero. Your task is to write a program to find the smallest child of a given integer, should it exist.   Input Your first line of input consists of 'K' (1 ≤ K ≤ 50) test cases. The number of test cases 'K' is given in the first line of the input followed by a blank line. Each test case takes one line containing an integer N , (20 ≤ N ≤ 100,000).    Output The output of your program will print exactly one line for each test case. The line is to contain a child of N for each test case. If X has more than one child, print the smallest. If X, however, does not have any children, print "NONE". The following shows sample input and output for three test cases.  Example  Input:  3 216 121 2005  Output:  198 NONE 1979  
Hackers! Hackers! Everywhere! Some days back your email ID was hacked. Some one read the personal messages and Love Letters you sent to your girl friend. That's a terrible thing, well, you know how are the boys at ISM. So, you have decided that from now onwards you will write Love Letters to your girlfriend in a different way. Suppose you want to write "i love you sweet heart", then you will write "I evol uoy teews traeh".   Input First line will contain the number of test cases T, not more than 20. Each test case will contain a line of not more than 100 characters and all the characters will be small alphabets only ('a'-'z'). There will be exactly one space between two words.    Output For each test case output a single line in the new format.   Example  Input: 3 can you meet me outside ccd today a this year hard kaur is coming to entertain us   Output: nac uoy teem em edistuo dcc yadot a siht raey drah ruak si gnimoc ot niatretne su  
A certain business farm has introduced a loyalty program. At the time of registration to the loyalty program, a customer is given 1 point. The points will get upgraded after the first new purchase every week. After such purchase, the customer can select between the following two policies to upgrade points:  Get exactly 1 more point Double the points that he/she has  For example, if the customer had 43 points before a purchase, he/she can upgrade it to 44 or 86, depending upon points upgrade policy of their choosing. At the time of registration, each customer is also given a Jackpot target. Special facilities will be provided to the customer if the accumulated points of the customer become equal to this Jackpot. However, accumulating points more or less than the Jackpot does not earn them anything. For example, for a customer with Jackpot target 437, special facilities will be provided if and only if his/her points becomes exactly equal to 437 after some purchases. Of course the simplest plan that may be adopted by the customer is to increment his points by 1 after each purchase. However, an intelligent customer would like to achieve the Jackpot score in the minimum number of purchases. Even still, for a single customer, the number of weeks in which he gets the Jackpot will be equal to the number of purchases, since only the first purchase in a week qualifies towards upgrade of points. The most intelligent customer of all would partner with a friend and try to merge their points in the end. Of course this is better because this means that fewer weeks will be necessary to achieve the Jackpot. Alice and Bob are going to use this strategy. They will decide a sub-target score for themselves (which may be different for each of them) and try to reach that sub-target in the fewest number of weeks (at the rate of one purchase per week). Once both of them reach that sub-target, they will merge their points to achieve Alice's Jackpot target! See the Explanation Section for clarification. Write a program that takes as input Alice's Jackpot score and outputs the minimum number of weeks Alice and Bob take to achieve the Jackpot score. Note that Alice and Bob will never merge their scores in between. They will only merge their scores once they reach the respective sub-targets they decide for themselves.  Input The first line of input contains the number T, the number of test case. Each test case contains a single integer N, Alice's Jackpot target.  Output For each test case, output a single line containing the number W, the minimum number of weeks necessary for Alice and Bob to achieve Alice's Jackpot target.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 1000 2 ≤ N ≤ 1000000000   Sample Input  4 2 4 10 55   Sample Output  0 1 3 6   Explanation In the first example, Alice and Bob have already reached the target. In the second example, they both choose the sub-target 2 and achieve it in 1 week by making one purchase each. Their merged score then becomes equal to 4. In the last example, Alice chooses to reach 8 and Bob chooses to reach 2. Alice can reach 8 in 3 weeks and Bob reaches 2 in 1 week. Thus, they achieve their target 10, in 3 weeks (bottlenecked on Alice). There are more ways to split the target to still achieve it in 3 weeks, but there is no way to split the target among them to achieve it in 2 weeks. Hence, the answer is 3. In the last test case, Alice and Bob can split the target as 36 and 19. 36 can be achieved Alice in 6 purchases (or weeks). 19 can be achieved by Bob in 6 purchases (or weeks). Hence, the answer is 6. Of course there are other ways, but there is no way that can achieve this in fewer than 6 weeks.

The King of France has turned old. He would like one of his three sons to take up his place as the next King. But he doesn’t want them to fight over the throne after his death. Over so many years in the past, his sons have been fighting with each other over trifles. But he feels that deep inside their hearts, the three brothers love each other. The King believes that he can bring back the love and harmony among his sons which was present in their childhood. He has asked Leonardo to help him accomplish this task so that his sons cherish their relationship again. So, Leonardo has come up with a game that will force all three of them to play together. The factory, just on the boundary of the kingdom, produces special kind of gold chips. Each gold chip is inscribed with a lowercase letter of the English alphabet, called its nameLetter. There is also a unique integer called aurumNumber associated with each gold chip which is inscribed on the other side of the gold chip. These chips also have special grooves on their ends which can be used to attach gold chips one after the other and make a long solid linear chain out of them. On Leonardo’s advice the King has decided to call all his 3 sons for a small collective exer cise. Leonardo has made three chains A, B and C containing the same number of gold chips. The gold chips in each of these chains are arranged in the increasing order of their aurumNum bers. Leonardo gives a chain to each of the sons. The task given to the sons is that each of them has to create a chain, for which he may remove some of the gold chips from his chain. It is necessary that all the three new chains thus created must have the same nameLetters when read from left to right. All the removed gold chips will be donated for charity. Each new gold chain must also have the gold chips arranged in the increasing order of their aurumNumber. If the sons succeed in doing this, they get to keep the gold chain with themselves. They must donate the entire chain with all of the gold chips for charity if they fail to create such chains. All of the three sons are very greedy and therefore they want to remove the minimum number of gold chips from their respective gold chains. You have to find out that what is the minimum number of total gold chips that the three sons have to donate in order to complete this exercise successfully.  Input The first line of the input contains an integer T which is the number of test cases to follow. Starting from the next line, each test case consists of three strings A, B and C in separate lines. Each of these strings is the sequence of nameLetters in the order of the gold chips (which are arranged in the increasing order of their aurumNumber) in the gold chain.    Output For each of the test cases, print the minimum number of total gold chips which the three sons will have to donate for charity.    Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 13 1 ≤ |A|, |B|, |C| ≤ 450 |A| = |B| = |C| Here, |A| denotes the length of a string A. Similarly |B| for B and |C| for C.     Sample Input: 2 acmicpc acmicpd acdicpc aab aba abb  Output: 6 3    Explanation Case 1: The gold chips donated by the first son are ‘m’ and ‘c’. The second son donates ‘m’ and ‘d’ and the third son donates ‘d’ and ‘c’. This leaves “acicp” as the nameLetters on the gold chains they create Case 2: The gold chips donated by the sons are ‘a’, ‘a’ and ‘b’, respectively. This leaves each of them with “ab”. 
The capital city of the kingdom of France has a lot of tribal clans living in the outskirts. Farming and hunting are the two major occupations of these people. These clans keep moving around the kingdom and make their homes using wood and leaves. Each clan has a different culture and in general people of one clan do not like people from the other clans. They live separately and have intra-clan weddings only. With the advent of the new season, there are floods coming in from the Seine River. As these people don’t have proper houses to live in, they have requested the King to provide shel- ter in the well protected capital city. The King has decided to construct temporary houses for these clans in the Great Royal Circle which is a circle in shape. As these clans do not like each other, they can’t live together and would need some kind of a boundary to separate their shelters. The King has come up with a plan to do so. He decided that a number of bamboo sticks will be placed on the boundary of the Great Royal Circle. Then for every pair of bamboo sticks a wired fence will be used to connect them and create partitions of the circle. The bamboo sticks will be placed such that no three fences cross at the same point within the circle. Proper joints are placed at locations where two fences cross each other. In this way, the Great Royal Circle is divided into a number of regions each of which will be given to a clan to live in temporarily. As there is a shortage of dry bamboo sticks, the King’s soldiers could only manage N bamboo sticks to be placed on the boundary of the Great Royal Circle. What is the maximum number of different clans the King can provide shelter to?    Input The first line of the input contains an integer T which is the number of test cases. Next follow T lines each containing an integer N, the number of bamboo sticks available.    Output For each test case, output in a separate line the maximum number of clans which can be provided shelter from the floods. Since this number can be very big, output it modulo 1000000007.    Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 30000 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^9     Example Input: 4 2 3 4 5  Output: 2 4 8 16 
The King of Florence is captured by traitors. The treasures of Florence need immediate protection. Before his surrender the King had entrusted Da Vinci with the task to hide the treasures safely. The army of Florence also came forward to help Da Vinci in this task. They have informed Da Vinci that the whole army of Florence is divided into N troops, each troop guarding a patch of land within the boundary of Florence. Since, disturbances are common during the time of war, it is quite possible that a land under a troop’s protection overlaps with those under other troops. The amount of security of a location (any point on the grid) is defined as the number of troops guarding it. With this information, Da Vinci has decided that he will hide the treasures in a location which is guarded by the maximum number of troops, thus providing the treasure the maximum possible security. Can you help Da Vinci find the most secure location? For this problem, the land of Florence can be assumed to be a rectangular grid. Each troop guards a rectangular portion of the grid with the bottom left corner as (x1 , y1) and the top right corner as (x2, y2). Each rectangle has all its sides parallel to the axes of the grid. Find the maximum security possible in the land of Florence, given the information of troops.    Input First line of the input consists of T , the number of test cases to follow. Each test case begins with a line containing an integer N . Each of the next N lines gives 4 space separated integers x1 , y1,x2, y2 representing a rectangle with ( x1 , y1 ) and (x2, y2 ) as the bottom left and the top right corners, respectively.    Output Print T lines, each containing the maximum security achievable in the grid for each test case.    Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^4 x1 ≤ x2 y1 ≤ y2 -10^8 ≤ x1, x2, y1, y2 ≤ 10^8     Sample Input: 1 5 2 6 5 7 2 2 5 5 2 1 6 4 1 2 7 3 4 3 6 6  Output: 4    Explanation In the given sample input, the point (4, 3) lies in all the rectangles except the first one. Hence, it lies in 4 different rectangles thus having a security amount of 4 which is the maximum among all grid points. 
Leonardo Da Vinci has entered a fort which has N catacombs numbered from 1 to N . A cat- acomb is an underground cemetery consisting of a subterranean gallery. His aim is to destroy each of the N catacombs, as quickly as possible. The catacombs have a special structure. The catacombs are built in layers, with exactly one catacomb (numbered 1) in the topmost layer (layer number 1). If a catacomb is in the i^th layer, it will have exactly one passage to one of the catacombs in the (i − 1)^th layer. Also, from each catacomb, there is exactly one way out, which is to keep going to the above layers till you reach the top layer. In graph theory terms, the catacombs structure is a tree rooted at vertex number 1. Just before he was going to destroy the catacombs, his apprentice sent him a few messages with the information of the catacombs that have kids in them. Each message contains the number of the catacomb that has a kid inside it. Leonardo must not destroy any catacomb that would lead to a kid being trapped inside the fort. Leonardo has to find out how many catacombs he can destroy without trapping a kid inside.    Input First line contains a single integer T , denoting the number of testcases. Each testcase starts with a single integer N , denoting the number of catacombs. Each of the next N − 1 lines contains 2 numbers A and B indicating that there is a passage between catacomb number A and B. Next line contains M , the number of messages Leonardo got from his apprentice, followed by M lines each containing an integer indicating the number of the catacomb that has a kid inside it.    Output For each message, print the number of catacombs that Leonardo can destroy without trapping any of the kids mentioned so far in the messages.    Constraints Should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have. Format it like:  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ N, M ≤ 50000 1 ≤ A, B ≤ N     Sample Input: 1 2 1 2 2 2 1  Output: 0 0    Explanation The above system of catacombs have catacomb number 1 in layer 1 and catacomb number 2 in layer 2. First message says that there is an kid in catacomb 2. Hence none of the catacombs can be destroyed (else the kid gets trapped). In the second message, another kid is reported in catacomb 1. Still, none of the catacombs can be destroyed. Hence answer after each message is 0. 
Da Vinci is about to retire from the post of Prime Minister of the French King in a month. It is going to be very difficult for the King to find his replacement. The King is worried about the junior ministers as to how they will work without a leader. To instill in some values of team work among them, the King has asked all the N junior ministers to paint M walls together. The King feels that such a hands-on activity is a very good way to make the junior ministers come together and work as a team. The ministers are allowed to divide a wall into parts such that each part is painted by a different minister. No two ministers are allowed to paint the same wall at the same time. It can be assumed that all the ministers paint the wall at the same rate. As this is just a training exercise, ministers may have other important jobs as well and they may not be free all the time to do the painting work. S is the start time and E is the end time between which a minister is free to paint the walls. Also, we know that for a minister, painting is a mundane job. It may happen that a minister gets bored while painting a wall, leaves it in between and starts painting another wall without wasting any time. The minister may later come back to finish the previous wall or he may ask one of the other ministers who he is friends with to finish painting the wall. The King is really worried about the future of the kingdom which is going to have these min- isters without a leader. He really wants these ministers to make smart decisions and perform well in any situation that they may face. Thus, he has decided to put some extra constraints on the wall painting exercise. The King knows the number of man hours H required for a wall to get painted completely. So, for each wall he has decided a duration with the start time A and the end time D during which the ministers should start and finish painting the wall. As anxious the King is about testing his ministers, he is also worried that a failure in com- pleting the task may harm their confidence. He wants to know whether his junior ministers would be able to finish the given task and meet the deadlines or not. You need to help the King to find this out.    Input The first line of the input contains an integer T which is the number of test cases to follow. The first line of each test case consists of two space separated integers N and M . Each of the next N lines contains two space separated integers S and E. Next M lines contain three space separated integers A, D and H each.    Output For each test case, output a separate line containing “YES” (quotes for clarity) if it is possible for the junior ministers to paint each of the walls during the designated time. Output “NO” (quotes for clarity) if it is not possible to do so.    Constraints Should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have. Format it like:  1 ≤ T ≤ 510 1 ≤ N,M ≤ 100 0 ≤ S,E,A,D,H ≤ 10^7     Example Input: 1 2 2 1 5 3 4 1 5 3 2 4 2  Output: YES    Explanation The first minister paints the first wall from time 1 − 2. Then he paints the second wall from time 2 − 3. Then he paints the first wall again from time 3 − 5. The second minister paints the second wall from time 3 − 4. Thus both the walls get painted fully. 
The kingdom of France is about to be at war with one of its neighbouring kingdoms. Both these kingdoms share a long border along which the French army has set up a number of posts. Each post has an army posted on it to protect the kingdom from the enemy attacking at that post. Geographically, the most vulnerable of these army posts is the post by the Sienne river. Therefore it is expected that the first attack from the enemy is going to be on this post of Sienne. The total army strength of France is currently at an all time low. Thus army strength at the post of Sienne is not much and in case of an attack it will need backup from the other army posts. Thus, it is very necessary for the French troops at all the other posts to be able to move quickly to the post of Sienne in case of an attack. There is a road network connecting the army posts. Each of these roads has an army post at either end. The roads are bidirectional, i.e. the army at any one of these posts can move on the road to reach the post at the other end. The soldiers can also take a sequence of roads to go to the required post for backing it up. The enemy is suspected to make an attempt to destroy exactly one road of this network so that the post of Sienne can not receive full backup from some or all of the other posts. Fear- ing this, the French King has asked Leonardo Da Vinci to construct a few more similar roads connecting these army posts. Even if exactly one of the roads gets destroyed by the enemy, this construction must ensure that the post of Sienne can receive backup from all the remaining army posts. Your goal is to help Leonardo and tell him the minimum number of roads that need to be built to make this possible. You are given the information about the road network connecting the army posts. There are N army posts, labelled 1, 2, . . . , N with the post of Sienne being labelled 1. Currently there are M roads each connecting 2 army posts. At most one road can exist between two army posts. It is possible that with the given set of roads, you cannot reach some army posts from the post of Sienne.    Input The first line of the input contains an integer T , the number of test cases in the file. Then T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers N and M . Following next are M lines which indicate the M roads. Of these lines, the i th line contains two space separated integers ai and bi indicating the army posts connected by the i^th road.    Output For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum number of roads that need to be built to achieve the above goal. If it is not possible print −1.    Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 13 1 ≤ N ≤ 5000 0 ≤ M ≤ 131313 1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ N For no pair i and j (i ≠ j) both ai = aj and bi = bj The maximum number of lines in each file would be 500000.     Sample Input: 1 4 3 1 2 2 3 3 4  Output: 1    Explanation Adding road 1, 4 will ensure that each army post is connected to 1 even if any road fails. 
   Da Vinci was once wandering on the roads of Florence when he found a child playing with a binary string L. He was delighted to see that a small child was showing interest in the beautiful world of binary strings. To further interest the child and to make sure that the child keeps on playing with binary strings, he gave the child a task: Each day the child has to now play with the binary string that comes lexicographically after the string that he was playing with on the previous day. He promised the child that whenever he visits back, he will ask him the string that he should be playing with. If the child gets the correct string, he will recieve a reward from Da Vinci, and may be Da Vinci will take him as his student. Help the child to find what string he should be playing with on the day Da Vinci visits him back.  Input  First line contains T, the number of testcases. It is followed by 2T lines, 2 lines per testcase. First line of each testcase starts with a binary string L. Second line contains a single integer K, number of days after which Da Vinci visits the child. The binary string has no leading zeroes, e.g., 0111 has a 0 in the leading (first) position, and such strings will not be there in the input.   Output  For each testcase, output one line containing the required answer. The output string should not have leading zeroes.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 1000 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^18   Example Input: 2 1001 1 1000 3  Output: 1010 1011  
  The Second Italian War of 1499 has started and the French troops have attacked Milan. Leonardo Da Vinci is worried for the safety of his diary where he keeps the secrets of all his creations. He would never want that diary to get into the hands of the French King. For this, he creates a special box which can only be opened if you enter a special key K. K is an N - 1 length string containing only lowercase letters of the English alphabet. But when Leonardo was putting his diary into the box and was about to lock it with the key, the French soldiers walk in. They saw the key entered by Leonardo and have taken him captive and have possession of the box.  But when Leonardo was putting his diary into the box and was about to lock it with the key, the French soldiers walk in. They saw the key entered by Leonardo and have taken him captive and have possession of the box. But knowing the reputation of Leonardo, they are being cautious and have captured one of Leonardo's apprentices to gather more information on how to open the box. The apprentice (after torture) provided them with the following information:  Leonardo has made the box in such a way that you could lock it by entering any N length string L of lowercase letters such that removing exactly one letter from L gives K, the string that will unlock the box. The soldiers have seen Leonardo entering N in the box. If they enter a wrong key, the contents of the box will be destroyed by an acidic substance hidden inside the box. It may happen that the box is rigged to hurt the person trying to open the box, by possibly throwing some acidic substance over his hands.   The soldiers have now decided not to take the risk of getting acid burns and have forced the apprentice to open the box on the condition that his life will be spared only if he opens the box without damage. The apprentice fearing for his life, has entered a string K as the unlock pattern.   Given the two strings L and K, the one entered by Leonardo, and the one entered by the apprentice respectively, can you tell whether Leonardo's secrets will be uncovered or not?   Input  The first line contains an integer T which is the number of test cases to solve. It is followed by 2T lines containing the test cases. Each test case consists of 2 strings L and K, respectively in separate lines.   Output  For each test case print the output in a separate line. If Leonardo's secrets are now in hands of French soldier, print 1 otherwise 0.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ N ≤ 20000   Example Input: 5 acmicpc acicpc acmicpc acmicp acmicpc cmicpc acmicpc acmcpi acmicpc cmicpa  Output: 1 1 1 0 0  
  Define function F on set of positive integers as  A positive integer n is called an "identity integer" if F(n) = {n}. Given multiple queries, each consisting of a single integer K, find the K^th "identity integer".  Input  First line contains a single integer Q, denoting the number of queries. Q lines follow, each containing a single integer K.   Output  For each query, print a single integer, the K^th "identity integer" modulo 1000000007.   Constraints  1 ≤ Q, K ≤ 200000   Example Input: 1 1  Output: 4  
 Points:10 The Indian Heights School believes that learning with the aid of technology is the fastest way to do so. It is a pioneer in innovation and virtual classrooms in the country. Keeping in accordance with its practices, the school wants to integrate software and automate various functions at the classroom level. As college students, your team volunteered for this assignment and your proposal has been accepted by the school's director. Each day the class teacher picks a random number of students to delegate them duties for the day such as wiping the board, managing the class, maintaining the display boards and so on. But sometimes the students complain about being picked more frequently than the others.  Thus the teacher wants to know the number of ways to pick a certain number of students out of the total class. Your job is to help her do so...    Input:  The first line consists of total no of test cases. Each test case consists of one line containing two integers(space separated) a ≥ 1(i.e. total students) and 0 ≤ b ≤ a (i.e. number of students to be picked).   Output:  For each test case, print one line containing the required number. This number will always fit into an integer, i.e. it will be less than 2^31.    Example: Input:  2 5 3 10 5    Output:  10 252 
 Points:15 The Environmental Protection Agency is a billion dollar organisation that works to protect the environment from hazardous changes worldwide. It is funded by the national governments, charitable organisations, business donations as well as its own earnings. To evaluate the ground realities of the theory of global warming, the agency is developing a climate prediction prototype model that will simulate the climate given some parameters as well as predict climatic conditions worldwide. All data and parameters sent to this model in the form of Boolean matrices. Thus instead of processing single parameters one at a time, the model instead operates on multiple boolean matrices of similar parameters at the same time. This is a revolutionary new paradigm, but requires some testing and validation before it can be announced. Despite the exciting nature of this approach, it has a limitation. It can only process those Boolean matrices in which the sum of every row and every column evaluates to an even number. This is why you have been brought in. Given any Boolean matrix, you need to determine if it can be transformed into the required format by changing at most one value in the matrix, and if that is not possible then classify the matrix as corrupt for if we change more than one value, then the error will be too large to successfully predict the ever changing climate.    Input:  The first line consists of total no of test cases. The first line of each test case contains one integer n (n  Output:  For each matrix in the input file, print one line. If the matrix already has the sum of all rows and all columns evaluating to an even number, print 1. If it can be made to do so by changing one bit, print (i,j) where i is the row and j the column of the bit to be changed. Otherwise, print 0 to signify a corrupt matrix.    Example: Input:  3 4 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 4 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 4 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1    Output:  1 (2,3) 0 
  You need to shuffle a series of numbers from 1 To T, inclusive. The numbers are in ascending order, you have to shuffle them using bubble sort algorithm, that is swap every time a number is greater than another in the given list in the input. A number is greater than another in the list if the number appears later than the other in the list, check example for more clarity. Print the count of swaps done while you run the algorithm to shuffle them.  Following is the bubble sort algorithm procedure bubbleSort( A : list of items )      n = length(A)-1      for j=0 to n inclusive do         for i = 0 to n-1 inclusive do            /* if this pair is out of order */            if A[i] > A[i+1] then               /* swap them and remember something changed */               swap( A[i], A[i+1] )            end if         end for      end for     end procedure  Input Input description. Input will start will an integer N on newline representing the count of test case. Each case will contain a number T on a newline, representing total count of numbers. Next line of each test case will contain T integers representing the final shuffled series of numbers.    Output For each test case print the desired output, each on a newline.    Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 10 1 ≤ N ≤ 20     Example Input: 1 3 2 1 3 abac Output: 1   Explanation Example case 1. One swap between 1 and 2, because 1 appears later than 2, so 1 is greater than 2. 
Liliputs are holding a drawing competition for K kids, but with K human-sized pencils stolen from humans. In order to make life easier for the kids, the organizers want to give a pencil to each kid in a way such that the sum of the absolute differences of the height of a kid and the length of the pencil assigned to him/her is minimized. What is the minimum sum of absolute differences that can be achieved?  Input The first line contains the number of test cases N (0 < N ≤ 3). For each test case, the first line contains the number of kids and pencils K (0 < K ≤ 100). The second line contains K positive integers, each containing the height in millimeter of a kid. The third line contains K positive integers, each containing the length in millimeter of a pencil.  Output For each test case, print the case number, followed by a colon, followed by a single space, followed by a single integer indicating the minimum sum of absolute differences achieved (in millimeter).  Sample Input  2 5 51 60 51 72 70 65 60 88 72 88 4 123 234 188 175 219 334 122 233  Sample Output  Case 1: 69 Case 2: 190 
A DNA sequence can be represented by a string of letters T, A, C, and G representing four different amino acids. DNA sequences are often matched to infer structural or functional similarities between living beings. Given two DNA sequences X and Y, the sequence Y is said to be contained in X if Y can be obtained from X by deleting 0 or more letters (not necessarily consecutive) in X. Given two DNA sequences X and Y, what can be the minimum length of a third sequence Z such that both X and Y are contained in Z?  Input The first line contains the number of test cases N (0 < N ≤ 3). For each test case, the first line contains two integers P and Q (0 < P, Q ≤ 1000) denoting the number of letters in the two sequences X and Y respectively. The second line contains the sequence X and the third line contains the sequence Y.  Output For each test case, print the case number, followed by a colon, followed by a single space, followed by a single integer indicating the minimum length of sequence Z.  Sample Input  2 7 6 TAGCTAG ATCATG 10 9 GGATGCTACA TCTACCGTA  Sample Output  Case 1: 9 Case 2: 13 
  Chef wants you to write a calculator program for carrying out some simple mathematical operations. Chef calls the program Calculator Plus Plus.   Input  First line contains an operation in the form : a operator b   Output  Output in a single line the result of the mathematical operation. Print "Invalid Operator" if input operator is none of these  +, -, *, /   Constraints  -(10^50)<=a,b<=(10^50)   Example Input: 10 + 30  Output: 40  Input: 1 % 1  Output: Invalid Operator   Explanation  In first example, 10 + 30 simply evaluates to 40 In second example, '%' is not a valid opeartor according to our Calculator plus plus program.  
 Sum and Color Chef is a mathematics student. His professor has given him a difficult task. Professor initially provides Chef with a list of numbers. For every number in the list, Chef has to calculate the sum 'S' of digits such that 0<=S<=9. Even if the sum of digits is coming as a 'n' digit number, Chef has to bring it down to 1 digit number by further calculating the sum of the n digits and so on. Each value of final one digit sum is assigned a color. The color starts from index 0 to 9 and the value for each is given as follows:-  0-red 1-blue 2-pink 3-white 4-black 5-violet 6-cyan 7-yellow 8-green 9-brown  For each number in the list, Chef will obtain a 1 digit sum at the end. From these sums, Chef needs to find the color relating to the maximum 1 digit sum from the list. Professor clarifies the problem through the following example: Consider a list of 2 numbers 52 and 181. The addition of digits of number 52 gives 52=5+2=7, and that of 181 gives 181=1+8+1=10=1+0=1. So the maximum value is 7. So look at the color present at index 7 i.e. 'yellow'. So the output is yellow. Help Chef write a program for this problem.  Input   The first line contains one integer ‘T’, which denotes Number of test cases. There are 2 lines for each of  ‘T’ test case   First line contains the total number of elements ’N’ in the list Second line ‘N’ numbers (each number can be considered as ‘Ai’)separated by whitespaces.    Output For each text case, You need to print one line containing the color obtained according to the maximum value of 'S' i.e. the color corresponding to maximum 1digit sum of number in the list  Constraints   1<=T<=100 1<=N<=250000 0<=Ai<=10^9  Example1 Input: 5 5 128 25 87 50 1558 4 11 22 33 44 3 36 14 1000 5 11112 95 96 256 2669 3 10 991 83   Output:  yellow green brown cyan pink    Explanation  Consider the 1st case:  Calculate sum of digits of every element  128=1+2+8=11=1+1=2  25=2+5=7  87=8+7=15=1+5=6  50=5+0=5  1558=1+5+5+8=19=1+9=10=1+0=1  So the maximum value is 7 and the output is the corresponding color to index 7 i.e.yellow.  
  Chef loves palindromes. Chef initially has odd number of charachters. Chef wants to create a palindrome of maximum even length using these characters. For this Chef needs to discard one character. Help Chef find the character which needs to be discarded so that he can use the rest characters in any order to form a palindrome haivng maximum even length.   Input  An integer 'T' on first line denoting number of test cases For each of the 'T' testcases, there are two lines First line contains an integer 'N' denoting number of characters in list Second line contains 'N' lowercase aphabetic characters which are not seperated by spaces   Output  For each of the 'T' test cases, display in a new line the character to be discarded   Constraints  N <= 12353 T <= 25   Example Input: 2 7 abcbdca 3 abb Output: d a   Explanation  'a' is a charcter that is repeated at index 0,6 'b' is a charcter that is repeated at index 1,3 'c' is a charcter that is repeated at index 2,5 'd' is a charcter that is only present at index 4 So, we need to remove 'd' so that we can get a palindrome having maximum possible even length.   similarly for 2nd test case "a" is the charcter to be discarded 
 Chef is known to have friends as well as enemies. Chef has a habit of communicating with friends through encrypted messages. But recently some of his enemies found the way to decrypt and get the original message. You need to write a program that simulates how the enemies decrypted the messages.  Chef’s enemies observed that Chef used to first pass N random string before the encrypted message. Afterwards it was noticed that the key to decode the message was hidden in it. The key for decoding was the summation of the values of the key characters. Key characters are those characters that appear in all the N strings exactly once (exactly once in each of the N strings). A character cannot be considered as key character if it exists in all N String but does not appear exactly once in any of the string.  Once all the key characters are found, the key is the summation of the position of all the key characters in the alphabetical series to mod 26. For example, If the key characters are a,b,c then the key is( 1 + 2 + 3 ) % 26 = 6.If there are no key characters then the default value of the key is 7.   Chef thought finding out this was easy, so he added another twist while encrypting. For all alphabets at index (index starting from 0) which represent a number in Fibonacci Series (0 1 1 2 3 5 and so on), such alphabets were shifted by the key towards right e.g.: a to c, b to d (for key 2). For the rest of  alphabets, they were shifted by the key towards left e.g.: d to b, r to p, a to y (for key 2). Also all the numbers or special characters should appear unchanged. Note: All the Strings are in lowercase  Input The first line contains a single integer N denoting the N string used for key Next N lines are the String Next Line is the encrypted Message which needs to be decoded  Output A single line containing the DECODED string.  Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 100 1 ≤ | S | ≤ 100   Example Input: 4 azfjybgbxnpyatfgcaxqylbxd gzbbbgaxnfatxqdjfaypgcyafl yjbfpcygxlgznyfbgxtqgxydaaa xxyyxxyyxdlbqffctpbngggjz cbkumuwlwkmtt_zwksa!!  Output: kjscecodecell_rocks!!   Explanation   Here in the above example, the key characters which exist in all the N strings and appear exactly once in all N strings are 'c', 'd', 'j', 'l', 'n', 'p', ’q’, 't', 'z' The key is (3 + 4 + 10 + 12 + 14 + 16 + 17 + 20 + 26) % 26 i.e.  122%26 = 18 So, the encryption key is 18 Through this information, we decode the message using opposite steps mentioned in the description. Original message: kjscecodecell_rocks!!   
  Clash of clans is a very popular game. Each player in the game is allocated a base with certain hit points the player can train a limited number of troops on the base. There are three types of troops: Barbarian, Archers and Giants. The Cost of training a Barbarian is 100, an Archer is 500, and a Giant is 1500. When attacking an opponent’s base, Barbarian can reduce 1 hit point per sec, Archer 2 hit points per sec and Giant 3 hit points per sec.   After training the troops, you attack a particular opponent’s base. The opponent’s base has certain hit points. To completely destroy the opponent base, your troop's total hit points should be equal or more than the opponent's base hit points keeping in mind that the opponent's base can heal itself N*15 (Where N is the size of the troops) hit points every min   Here, you will be given the size ’N’ of the army you can take, the hit points ’H’ of the opponent’s base, and the time ’T’ within which you need to destroy the opponents base. Your task is to create a troop, which will destroy the opponent’s whole base within the given time limit with a MINIMUM COST.  Note: You need to consider all N troops for destroying the opponent base. Also the input will be such that it is possible to destroy the opponent's base using certain troops.  Input The first line contains a single integer N which is the size of the army The first line contains a single integer T which is the time limit The first line contains a single integer H which is the hit point of opponent’s base  Output A single line containing minimum cost of the army  Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6 1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ H ≤ 10^6   Example1: Input: 9 2 1530 Output: 3300   Example2: Input: 5 3 2475 Output: 7500   Example3: Input: 3 1 60 Output: 300   Explanation  In Example 1: We have to take 9 troops, and we have got 2 mins to destroy i.e. 120 secs to destroy the whole base. And the hit points of the base are 1530. Including the healing effects (9*2*15 = 270) the hit points of the opponent’s base is 1800. So the minimum cost army can be 6 Archers and 3 Barbarians, which cost 6*500 +3*100 =3300 which can destroy the whole base in 2 mins. In Example 2: We have to take 5troops, and we have got 3 mins to destroy i.e. 180 secs to destroy the whole base. And the hit points of the base are 2475. Including the healing effects (5*3*15 = 225) the hit points of the opponent’s base is 2700. So the minimum cost army can be all 5 Giants, which cost 5*1500=7500 which can destroy the whole base in 3 mins.   In Example 3: We have to take 3 troops, and we have got 1 mins to destroy i.e. 60 secs to destroy the whole base. And the hit points of the base are 60. Including the healing effects (3*1*15 = 45) the hit points of the opponent’s base is 105. So the minimum cost army can be all 3 Barbarians, which cost 3*100 =300 which can destroy the whole base in 1 mins.  
Chef has recently started attending probability class. For the first three lectures he had no homework but for the fourth lecture he had one to do. The problem was given as range [A,B] over positive integers, chef has to find the probability of a number chosen at random within the range (including A and B) such that it will contain at least one zero.  Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. Each line of the test case contains two space separated integers A and B denoting the range extremities.   Output  For each test case, output a single line containing the probability in fraction and NOT in decimal.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 10 0 ≤ A ≤ 10^5 0 ≤ B ≤ 10^6     Example Input: 2 1 20 100 999  Output: 2/20 171/900  Explanation Example case 1.The range given is 1 to 20. So look at all the integers from 1 to 20, inclusive, we find that 10 and 20 are the only two numbers that have a zero in them. And hence the probability to find them is 2/20. 
 Daenerys Targaryen has been suggested by her counselors to leave the Meereen and start conquering other parts of the world. But she knows giving up on the people of Meereen means victory of slavery. Her plan is to start conquering rest of the world while she remains in Meereen. She can only trust her bravest and most beloved Daario Naharis to undertake this risk. She asks him to conquer a few nations and promises him a help from her dragons. She also promises to marry him if he successfully conquers all the nations and not if he is defeated. Daario has to conquer 'N' number of nations each nation with army size A[i]. He attacks the nations serially. As promised, he gets help from Daenerys's Dragons. His first 'M' attacks are made with the help of Dragons.   For first 'M' attacks, he gains A[i] soldiers.  For the rest, he looses ceiling of A[i]/2 soldiers.  He is defeated if he is left with no army before he conquers all the 'N' nations. He has no army initially and only has Dragons.  Input First line has 'T' which is the number of test cases. For each test cases there are two space separated integers 'N' and 'M' denoting the number of nations and the number of nations he has Dragon's help for respectively. Follows N space separated integers denoting the size of army of each nation.  Output Print 'VICTORY' if Daario conquers all nations and 'DEFEAT' if he doesn't.    Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 500 1 ≤ M ≤N ≤ 100000 1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 100000     Example Input:  3 5 3 1 2 3 4 5 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 7 4 10 10 10 10 50 60 70  Output:  VICTORY VICTORY DEFEAT     Explanation Example case 1. First 3 attacks add 1,2,3 to his army making it 6. (1+2+3 = 6) Then he looses 2 and 3 making it 1. (6-2-3 = 1) He conquers all so VICTORY.  Example case 2. First 2 attacks add 4,4 to his army making it 8. (4+4 = 8) Then he looses 2,2,2,2 making it 0. (8-2-2-2-2 = 0) He conquers all so VICTORY.  Example case 3. First 4 attacks add 10,10,10,10 to his army making it 40. (10+10+10+10 = 40) Then he looses 25 and then all 15 out of possible 30 making it 0. (40-25-15 = 0) He is defeated on 6th attack so DEFEAT.  
Given an alphanumeric string made up of digits and lower case Latin characters only, find the sum of all the digit characters in the string.  Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case is described with a single line containing a string S, the alphanumeric string.   Output  For each test case, output a single line containing the sum of all the digit characters in that string.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 1000 1 ≤ |S| ≤ 1000, where |S| is the length of the string S.   Example Input: 1 ab1231da  Output: 7  Explanation The digits in this string are 1, 2, 3 and 1. Hence, the sum of all of them is 7. 
 Ramesh, Suresh, Mahesh, and Mukesh are moving to a new city and are looking for apartments to live.   Now this city is not like any other city. This city is a matrix of apartments and there are no roads. The only way to commute is to go through apartments.   If any of the friends go through an apartment even once, the group will have to pay its full rent. From an apartment, you can go to the apartments to its North, South, East, or West.   Since Ramesh, Suresh, Mahesh, and Mukesh are best friends, they want to meet each other at least once a month. Also, all four are highly superstitious, so Ramesh only goes West, Suresh only goes North, Mahesh only goes East, and Mukesh only goes South.   Any number of people can live in any of the apartments. Cost of all the apartments in the city is given, some of which may be negative. Negative cost means if any of the friend lives in or goes through this apartment, the group will get paid an amount equal to the negation of the cost. Now the aim of the four friends is to find the minimum cost for which all of them can live in the city and meet each other at least once a month. Note: The four friends can meet in an apartment where none of them actually lives as well.  Input First line contains T, the number of test cases to follow. First line of each test case contains two integers: N and M, where N denotes the number of rows in the matrix and M denotes number of columns in the matrix. Next N lines describe the rows of the matrix follow, one row per line. Each row contains M space-separated integers denoting the cost of the apartment.  Output For each test cases, output the minimum cost as asked in the problem.  Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 4*10^4 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^3 1 ≤ M ≤ 10^3 -10^4 ≤ Cost of any apartment ≤ 10^4 1 ≤ Sum of N*M over all test cases ≤ 10^6   Example Input: 4 3 3 1 2 3 4 -10 5 6 7 8 3 3 1 -10 3 -13 -12 -11 7 8 9 3 3 1 -2 3 -4 5 -6 7 -8 9 4 4 1 2 3 4 5 6 -7 8 -9 -10 -11 -12 13 14 -15 16  Output: -10 -46 -15 -64   Explanation Example case 1.All 4 friends stay at the apartment which has rent -10. Example case 2.Mukesh lives in the apartment with rent -10, Mahesh lives in the apartment with rent -13, Suresh lives in the apartment with rent -12, and Ramesh lives in the apartment with rent -11 Example case 3.Mukesh lives in the apartment with rent -2, Mahesh lives in the apartment with rent -4, Suresh lives in the apartment with rent -8, and Ramesh lives in apartment with rent -6. They all meet at the apartment with rent 5. So the total cost becomes (-2) + (-6) + (-4) + (-8) + (5) = -15 Example case 4.Mukesh lives in the apartment with rent -7, Mahesh lives in the apartment with rent -9, Suresh lives in the apartment with rent -15, and Ramesh lives in the apartment with rent -12. They all meet at the apartment with rent -11. So the total cost becomes -7-9-10-11-12-15 = -64 
 You are given a 1-indexed array of size N. Initially, all elements of the array are zeros. You need to perform U updates to the array.   Each Update asks you to add 1 to the elements of the array at the indices specified by 'ax+b' for all non-negative integers x, where a and b are positive integers which specify an update query.   After performing all the updates to the array, print the array with every entry separated by space.   Input First Line of the input contains 2 space separated integers N, U. Each of the next U lines contains 2 space-separated integers: a and b, specifying an update.  Output Output the array in a single line after all updates.  Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ a, b ≤ N 1 ≤ U ≤ 2*10^5   Example Input: 7 4 1 3 7 7 7 3 2 2  Output: 0 1 2 2 1 2 2  Explanation Array after first update : [0,0,1,1,1,1,1] Array after second update : [0,0,1,1,1,1,2] Array after third update : [0,0,2,1,1,1,2] Array after fourth update : [0,1,2,2,1,2,2] 
 There are N seats in a theatre, all of them in a single row. The seats are numbered from 1 to N. You are given two types of events:   1 — A person arrives. Persons are numbered from 1 in order of their arrival. 2 i — Person i leaves the theatre.   A person arriving in the theatre chooses a seat according to the following algorithm: If the entire theatre is empty, the person will occupy seat 1. Otherwise, he will occupy the seat which is farthest possible from any nearest seated persons. In other words, in the seat which maximizes the minimum distance to any other person currently seated. If there are many such seats, the person will occupy the leftmost of them.   Input The first line of input contains 2 space-separated integers: the first is N, denoting the number of seats, and the second is Q, denoting the number of events. Then Q events follow in the format described above.  Output For each person arriving, output the seat number that he occupies.  Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 10^18 1 ≤ Q ≤ 2 * 10^5 Each query is valid.   Example Input: 2 7 1 1 2 1 1 2 2 2 3 1  Output: 1 2 1 1  Explanation: Initially both seats are empty (x denotes empty seat and number denotes id of person occupying it): xx Query 1: Person #1 arrives and takes seat 1 (so output 1): 1x Query 2: Person #2 arrives and takes seat 2 (so output 2): 12 Query 3: Person #1 leaves: x2 Query 4: Person #3 arrives and takes seat 1 (so output 1): 32 Query 5: Person #2 leaves: 3x Query 6 Person #3 leaves: xx Query 7: Person #4 arrives and takes seat 1 (so output 1): 4x 
You are given a tree. Each node of the tree is assigned a distinct value. A path in the tree is considered weird if the values in the path increase and decrease alternatively. For example: Consider a straight chain of nodes 1→3→2→4→5 with value assigned to any node i being i itself. Then the path 3→2→4, 1→3→2, etc. are weird whereas 1→3→2→4→5 is not weird because 2→4 and 4→5 are both increasing. You are given Q queries. Each query contains the root of the tree, R, and an arbitrary node, S. For each query, you need to find the sum of all weird paths in the subtree rooted at S with respect to R being the root of the original tree. Sum of a path is defined as the sum of values assigned to all nodes on that path. As this sum could be very large, output it modulo M. Note:  Paths of length 2 are always considered weird. A path is always defined for more than 1 node.   Input The first line of input contains 2 integers, N and M. Second line contains N space separated numbers where the i^th number denotes the value of the i^th node. These N numbers are permutation of the sequence of numbers from 1 to N. For the next N-1 line, each line contains 2 numbers a and b, denoting that node a is connected to node b. Next line contains a single integer Q, the number of queries to follow. Lastly, Q lines follow, where each line contains two space separated integers, R and S.  Output For each query, output the sum modulo M.  Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ M ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ R ≤ N 1 ≤ S ≤ N 1 ≤ Q ≤ 10^5   Example Input: 6 100000 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 2 5 1 4 3 4 1 6 5 3 1 5 2 1 6 2 4 5 1  Output: 26 81 0 7 52   Explanation Query 1: Nodes in the subtree 1 are [1,2,5,6]. Valid Paths are 5→2 , 2→1, 1→6, 2→1→6 . Corresponding sums are 7, 3, 7, and 9. Total sum is 26. Note:  A Path lies in a subtree if all nodes on the path are in the subtree.  
   Chingam likes to collect plates because they remind him of food. But Jimma hates plates, because they make a lot of noise when they break. Chingam has a collection of N plates hidden behind Jimma's bed, so that she cannot find them. The plates are arranged in K stacks, such that each stack has at least one plate. The stacks are indexed from 0 to K-1. Where 0 is index of the leftmost stack and K-1 is the index of the rightmost stack. Every plate has a weight w and a capacity c. These values might be different for different plates. A plate breaks when the sum of weights of the plates kept above it exceeds its capacity.   Whenever Chingam finds a new plate, he adds it to one of the K stacks. The plate is always added to the top. After he does this, some of the plates in that stack break. As Jimma is always sleeping and plotting world domination, if too many plates break at the same time, she will wake up and scratch Chingam. So Chingam will always choose the stack which minimize the number of plates that break and hope that the noise is not too loud. If there are multiple ways to do that, then he will place the plate in the leftmost such stack. Chingam is not very good at counting and he cannot always find the best stack on his own. Please help him!  You are given the initial arrangement of N plates in the stacks and Q queries. Query i describes a plate with capacity C[i] and weight W[i]. You have to tell Chingam the index of the best stack for this plate and the number of plates which break after this plate is added to that stack. Chingam will then add the plate to that stack.   Note:  The plates should be added in the order they appear in the queries.  A plate can break only once and its weight does not change after it breaks.  It is guaranteed that there are no broken plates in the initial arrangement; i.e. for every plate, the sum of plates on top of it will not exceed its capacity.   Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains the integer K and is followed by K lines. The i^th such line describes the i^th stack. The first integer on that line is n[i] the number of plates in that stack and is followed by 2*n[i] space separated integers. The 2*j^th and 2*j+1^th integers on that line give the capacity and the weight repectively, of the j^th plate from the bottom. The next line contains an integer Q, the number of queries and is followed by Q lines Each of these lines contain two space separated integers, the capacity and the weight of the plate in that query.     Output  For each test case, output Q lines, one for each query. Each line should contain two integers - the first integer should be the index of the best plate for that query and the second integer should be the number of plates which break in that query.     Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 3 1 ≤ K ≤ 5*10^4^ 1 ≤ Q ≤ 10^5^ The total number of plates (Q+N) in each test case will not exceed 10^5. All the weights and capacities are positive integers and do not exceed 10^9     Example Input: 1 3 2 5 10 3 3 2 7 15 2 1 1 2 8 2 3 4 9 5   Output: 1 1 2 1    Explanation Example case 1. There are 3 stacks and 2 queries. The first query has a plate of capacity 3 and weight 4. Placing that plate in the stack numbered 0 will break both the plates in that stack. Placing it in one of the other two stacks breaks only one plate. Chingam should place it in the leftmost stack, hence the output is 1 1. Now stack 1 has three plates and one of them is broken. Placing the next plate in either stack 0 or 1 will break two plates, while placing it in stack 2 will break only one. Hence the output is  2 1 . 
WARNING: The Input files may be as large as 8 MB. Use faster I/O methods. There is a tree, consisting of N nodes. A path is a sequence of one or more nodes of this tree, where every two adjacent nodes are connected by an edge and no node is visited twice. Generally, there are N^2 paths. Note that we are counting paths from each node onto itself as well. One path is smaller than another if the sequence of nodes of the first path is lexicographically smaller than the sequence of nodes of the second path (by usual rules). Thus (1,3,2) will be smaller than (1,3,4,5). And (2,4) will be smaller than (3). Every day, Lucy writes out a path on a sheet of paper. On the first day, she writes the lexicographically smallest path. On the second day, she writes the lexicographically second smallest path, and so on. Generally, on the K^th day, Lucy writes out the lexicographically K^th smallest path. Nana likes to read Lucy's notes about the paths in the tree. She is curious about the path that will be written on the Q^th day. Could you please help her?  Input The first line of input consists of a single integer T, the number of the test cases. Then, there are T test cases, given in the following form: the first line of the test case consists of an integer N, the number of nodes and an integer Q, the number from the statement. Then, N-1 lines follow. Each such line will consist of two integers X and Y with the meaning that there's an edge, connecting nodes X and Y in the tree. You may assume that you are always given a valid tree.  Output For every test case, output the lexicographically Q^th smallest path in the given tree on a single line, without leading or trailing spaces. There should be exactly one space between successive nodes in the path. Output the answer to the t^th test case should be given on the t^th line.  Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 100000 1 ≤ Q ≤ N^2 1 ≤ Sum of N over all the test cases in the single file ≤ 1000000   Sample Input  3 6 21 1 2 2 3 2 4 2 5 2 6 7 35 1 2 1 3 3 4 4 5 4 6 4 7 6 16 1 2 1 3 1 4 2 5 1 6   Sample Output  4 2 1 5 4 7 3 1 2 5   Explanation In the first test case, there are 36 paths in total.

The BSA (Bytelandian Security Agency) has intercepted several secret keys from the Trojan Kingdom. Each secret key is a prime number. But BSA was only able to retrieve some part of the digits, not all of them!  Johnny's job is to help BSA recover these lost primes, and he has delegated the task to you!  Input The first line contains a number t (about 15) which is the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow. Each test case is described in a single line containing the  patterns of the lost primes (the unknown digits are represented by '?'s. Each pattern's length is at most 12.  Output For each test case, print the recovered prime. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them. The recovered prime should have the same number of digits as the corresponding pattern and should contain no leading zeros. You can assume that there is at least one solution for each test case.  Example  Input: 3 ? ?3 1??  Output: 5 23 101  
 Mrs. Verma has decided to sell his car. N people have offered to buy the car. Instead of selling to the highest bidder, Mrs. Verma decides to sell his company to the Kth lowest bidder. How much money will Mrs. Verma get? Input  The first line of the input contains 2 space-separated integers, N and K. The next line contains N space separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN, denoting the money each of the N people are willing to pay.

For a non-negative integer N, define S(N) as the sum of the odd digits of N plus twice the sum of the even digits of N. For example, S(5)=5, S(456)=2*4+5+2*6=25, and S(314159)=3+1+2*4+1+5+9=27. Define D(N) as the last digit of S(N). So D(5)=5, D(456)=5, and D(314159)=7. Given 2 non-negative integers A and B, compute the sum of D(N) over all N between A and B, inclusive.

  Problem description.  Toretto has no friends. He has got family, and now they need him. His bitter enemy, Ian Shaw, has captured Toretto's beloved Letty and evil cooks in his head. All Toretto has is the algorithmic message Shaw left before leaving- Letty(n):     L = an empty list     while n > 0:         find the largest Fibonacci number f <= n         append f to L         n = n-f     return L Doing some research, Toretto finds about the Fibonacci series- F[0] = 0; F[1] = 1 ; for each i ≥ 2: F[i] = F[i-1] + F[i-2] But Shaw has a variation of the series which is encrypted in the above hint. Let's call it "The Letty Sequence". It's a position based sequence. The weights assigned to positions in the number are all distinct positive Fibonacci numbers, in order. For example, in the Letty Sequence, the sequence of digits 1101 represents the number 1*5 + 1*3 + 0*2 + 1*1 = 9. Some numbers have more than one representation in the Letty Sequence. For example, we can also represent 9 as 10001, because 1*8 + 0*5 + 0*3 + 0*2 + 1*1 = 9. To make the problem easier, Toretto now knows that the above algorithmic hint chooses one particular representation of n in Letty Sequence. For example, for n=9 we get the representation 10001 (i.e., 8+1), and for n=30 we get 1010001 (i.e., 21+8+1). Now Toretto needs to do this to know the location of Letty. 1. Use the above algorithmic hint to find a representation of n in Letty Sequence. 2. Take the sequence of digits obtained in step 1, and interpret it as a binary number (i.e., a number in base 2). 3. Find the decimal value of that binary number, say g(n). For example, suppose that n=30. First, we compute that 30 in Letty Sequence is 1010001. Next, we compute that 1010001 in base 2 is 64+16+1=81. Hence, g(30)=81. Shaw sees all this through his acquired God's Eye technology, and gives one final hint to Toretto. he gives him two numbers- L and R, and asks for the following answer- "g(L) xor g(L+1) xor g(L+2) xor ... xor g(R-2) xor g(R-1) xor g(R))." This is the final ride. Help the crew out, till they "See you again".    Input  First line contains T, the number of test cases. T lines follow. Each line contains two space seperated integers- L and R.   Output Output the required answer MODULO 1000000007.  Constraints  R will be between 1 and 10^15, inclusive. L will be between 1 and B, inclusive.  Example Input: 2 1 2 3 10    Output:  3 25    Explanation  TC 1: We have g(1)=1, g(2)=2, and (1 xor 2)=3. TC 2: Shaw's hint chooses the following Letty Sequence representations for the numbers 3 through 10: 00100 00101 01000 01001 01010 10000 10001 10010 If we consider these as base-2 numbers, their values are 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 16, 17, and 18. Thus, the answer is (4 xor 5 xor 8 xor ... xor 18) = 25. . 
A Little Elephant and his friends from the Zoo of Lviv like candies very much.  There are N elephants in the Zoo. The elephant with number K (1 ≤ K ≤ N) will be happy if he receives at least AK candies. There are C candies in all in the Zoo.  The Zoo staff is interested in knowing whether it is possible to make all the N elephants happy by giving each elephant at least as many candies as he wants, that is, the K^th elephant should receive at least AK candies. Each candy can be given to only one elephant. Print Yes if it is possible and No otherwise.   Input The first line of the input file contains an integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. Each test case consists of exactly 2 lines. The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers N and C, the total number of elephants and the total number of candies in the Zoo respectively. The second line contains N space separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN.   Output For each test case output exactly one line containing the string Yes if it possible to make all elephants happy and the string No otherwise. Output is case sensitive. So do not print YES or yes.   Constraints 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000 1 ≤ N ≤ 100 1 ≤ C ≤ 10^9 1 ≤ AK ≤ 10000, for K = 1, 2, ..., N  Example  Input: 2 2 3 1 1 3 7 4 2 2  Output: Yes No    Explanation Case 1. We can give one candy to the first elephant and two candies to the second elephant and make them both happy. Hence the answer is Yes. Alternatively we can give one candy to each elephant and left one candy for ourselves but they again will be happy.  Case 2. Even if we give four candies to the first elephant and two candies to the second elephant we will have only one candy left and can not make last elephant happy since he needs two candies for his happiness. Hence the answer is No. 
 Problem Statement Lelouch is one of the famous business men in Japan. One day on his way from 'Tokyo' to 'Kyoto', His vehicle is supposed to cross a CheckPoint. CheckPoint has N gates and at i th gate there are already X_i vehicles standing in a queue. There are only four types of Vehicles at the Check Point i.e Scooters,Cars,Buses and Trucks. and it will take 1,2,3,4 minutes to check a Scooter,Car,Bus and Truck respectively.As, Lelouch is very busy, He would like to stand in a gate which clears as soon as possible. Help him to find it out!  Input First line of Input consists of N - no of gates at the Check Point. next line has N positive integers X_1, X_2, X_3 ……….., X_N separated by space where X_i  denotes no of vehicles at the i th gate. In the next N lines i th line has X_i characters separated by space specifying the type of vehicles at ith gate. Each character can be ‘S’ or ‘C’ or ‘B’ or ‘T’ S- Scooter. C-Car. B-Bus. T-Truck.  Output The output contains a single integer, gate number at which Lelouch should stand. It is guaranteed that only one possible answer exists :).  Constraints  1 ≤ N ≤ 1000 1 ≤ X_i ≤ 1000   Example Input: 3 3 3 2 S C B C B T T T Output: 1  Explanation  There are 3 gates and it takes 6,9,8 mins to check all vehicles at gates 1,2,3 respectively. 
 Mr. Voldemort is a vicious criminal who intends to rob Azkaban. Azkaban is a country consisting of N cities which can be represented as a tree. But Dumbledore's Army (also known as the D.A.) were upto the task of stopping him. Azkaban had one highway which used to connect the cities lying at maximum distance from each other in the whole country i.e No other pair of cities were further apart from each other than these two. To maximise the safety of Azkaban, D.A. placed guards in each city lying on the highway. This highway was also called ‘The Line of Fire’.  There could possibly be many unordered pair of cities lying at maximum distance from each other, but there was only one ‘Line of Fire’ that lied between two cities. Which two cities does the line of fire lie between, Voldemort didn't know that but he did know that it lied between cities at maximum distance from each other. So to avoid risk, he decided to not rob any city that would surely lie on the ‘Line of Fire’ irrespective of which two cities the highway was laid between. Your task is to tell him how many such cities exist.  Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of cities in Azkaban. The second line contains N-1 space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting that there is an connection between the i^th and the A[i]^th city. Also note that Ai will always be less than i.   Output  For each test case, output a single line containing the number of cities that Mr. Voldemort should avoid visiting.   Constraints  1 ≤ T ≤ 20 2 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 0 ≤ Ai < i   Example Input: 2 2 0 3 0 1  Output: 2 3  Explanation Example case 1: In the first test case, Azkaban has just 2 cities with a path between them. So there is just one way of picking two cities at maximum distance from each other. Hence the Line of Fire will always pass through both these cities. 
 ACM International Collegiate     Programming Contest, Asia-Amritapuri Site, 2012 The Glittering Caves of Aglarond  'Strange are the ways of Men, Legolas! Here they have one of the marvels of the Northern World, and what do they say of it? Caves, they say!     Caves! Holes to fly to in time of war, to store fodder in! My good Legolas, do you know that the caverns of Helm's Deep are vast and beautiful?     There would be an endless pilgrimage of Dwarves, merely to gaze at them, if such things were known to be. Aye indeed, they would pay pure gold for a brief glance!     'And, Legolas, when the torches are kindled and men walk on the sandy floors under the echoing domes, ah! then, Legolas, gems and crystals and veins of     precious ore glint in the polished walls; and the light glows through folded marbles, shell-like, translucent as the living hands of Queen Galadriel.' - Gimli, describing to Legolas the Glittering Caves of Aglarond.  While these caves are by and large natural, there is one place where the Men of Rohan have chiseled into the rock to create a magnificent exhibit. You have a wall of the cave consisting of 'lighted diamonds' arranged in a N by M grid (basically, you have a light behind each diamond which can be turned on or off). Further, you have a switch corresponding to each row of this diamond-grid. When you operate a switch, it will toggle (flip) the lights corresponding to that row.  You are given the current configuration of the lighted diamonds. Gimli challenges Legolas to turn on as many diamonds as possible using EXACTLY K on/off operations of the switches. Since Legolas is an Elf of the Wood and doesn't care much for things that glitter, he instead asks for your help. Note that the same switch (i.e. row) can be chosen multiple times.  Input (STDIN):  The first line contains the number of test cases T. Each test case contains N, M and K on the first line followed by N lines containing M characters each. The ith line denotes the state of the diamonds in the ith row, where '*' denotes a diamond which is on and '.' denotes a diamond which is off.  Output (STDOUT):  Output T lines containing the answer for the corresponding case. Between successive test cases, there should not be any blank lines in the output.  Constraints:  1 <= T <= 100 1 <= N,M <= 50 1 <= K <= 100  Sample Input:   2 2 2 1 .. ** 2 2 2 .. **  Sample Output:   4 2  Notes/Explanation of Sample Input:  In the first test case, row 1 can be toggled hence leaving all 4 lights to be in the ON state. In the second test case, row 1 (or row 2) can be toggled twice, hence maintaining the state of the initial configuration.
