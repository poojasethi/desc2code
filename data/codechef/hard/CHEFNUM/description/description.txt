Chef defined amazingness of a number n as follows. Let array a denote the decimal representation of n.
amazingness of n is defined by following pseudo code.


amazingness(a)
{
    set s;
    int ans = 0;
    for ( int i = 0; i < a.length(); i++ ) {
         int val = 0;
         for ( int j = i; j < a.length(); j++ ) {
            val ^= a[j];  
            // a[j] denotes digit at j-th (0-based indexing) position of n counting  from most signficant digit (left to right).
            if (val not present in set s before) {
                 ans += val;
                 add val to set s
            }
         }
   }
   return ans;
}


Given two integers L, R. Find out the following sum : amazingnessL + amazingnessL + 1 + ... + amazingnessR. As the answer could be large, print your answer modulo 10^9 + 7 (1000000007)


Input

First line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. 
Each of the next T lines will contain two space separated integer L, R.


Output

For each test case, output a single integer in separate line corresponding to the value of desired sum.


Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ L, R ≤ 10^9.


Example
Input:
2
1 5
11 14

Output:
15
23

Explanation
Example case 2: The amazingness values of numbers 11, 12, 13, 14 are 1, 6, 6 and 10 respectively. They sum up to 23.
