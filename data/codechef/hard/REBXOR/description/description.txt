Nikitosh the painter has a 1-indexed array A of N elements. He wants to find the maximum value of expression 
(A[l1] ⊕ A[l1 + 1] ⊕ ... ⊕ A[r1]) + (A[l2] ⊕ A[l2 + 1] ⊕ ... ⊕ A[r2]) where 1 ≤ l1 ≤ r1 < l2 ≤ r2 ≤ N.
Here, x ⊕ y means the bitwise XOR of x and y.
Because Nikitosh is a painter and not a mathematician, you need to help him in this task.

Input
The first line contains one integer N, denoting the number of elements in the array.
The second line contains N space-separated integers, denoting A1, A2, ... , AN.

Output
Output a single integer denoting the maximum possible value of the given expression.

Constraints

2 ≤ N ≤ 4*10^5
0 ≤ Ai ≤ 10^9


Example
Input:
5
1 2 3 1 2

Output:
6


Explanation
Choose (l1, r1, l2, r2) = (1, 2, 3, 3) or (1, 2, 4, 5) or (3, 3, 4, 5).
