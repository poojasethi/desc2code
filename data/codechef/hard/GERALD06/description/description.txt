Problem Statement
Chef has a connected undirected graph G without multiedges and self-loops. A graph is called connected if there exists a path between any two vertices of the graph. This graph, G has an awesome property: it contains at least one vertex with degree at least 4.  One day Chef was playing with his graph. He constructed a graph L(G) based on the graph G.
The vertices of graph L(G) are the edges of graph G. Two vertices in the graph L(G) are connected with an undirected edge if and only if the
corresponding edges in graph G share a common vertex.
Today Chef has lost his favorite graph G. But he has the graph L(G). Please help Chef, restore the graph G from the graph L(G).

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers N and M - the number of vertices in L(G) and the number of edges in it. The next M lines
contain description of the edges. Each line contains two integers Ai, Bi - indices of vertices, connecting by the current edge. Consider L(G)
vertices are numbered from 1 to N.


Output
For each test case in the first line output an integer K - the number of vertices in the graph G. The next N lines should contain the description of the edges of the graph G (the i-th edge of G should correspond to the i-th vertex of L(G)).
You should number vertices in graph G from 1 to K. If there are multiple answers you can print any of them. Also you can insert whitespaces in your output if you want.


Constraints

1 ≤ T, N, M ≤ 5000;
1 ≤ Ai, Bi ≤ N;
Given graph L(G) is connected and doesn't contain multiedges and self-loops.
It's guaranteed that sum of all M values for all test cases doesn't exceed 5000.
It's guaranteed that for each test the answer exists.
