Given a set S of first N non-negative integers i.e. S = {0, 1, 2, ..., N}. Find number of ways of choosing a K size subset of S with the property that the XOR-sum of all chosen integers has exactly B set bits in its binary representation (i.e. the bits that are equal to 1). Since the answer can be large, output it modulo (10^9 + 7). Please refer to notes section for formal definition of XOR-sum.

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, K and B.

Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the answer to the corresponding test case.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 5
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^9
1 ≤ K ≤ 7
0 ≤ B ≤ 30


Example
Input:
3
2 2 0
2 2 1
2 2 2

Output:
0
2
1

Notes
XOR-sum of n integers A[1], , , A[n] will be A[1] xor A[2] xor .. A[n]. By xor, we mean bit-wise xor.

Explanation
Example case 1. There is no way to choose a subset of 2 integers from {0, 1, 2} such that the XOR-sum contains 0 set bits.
Example case 2. The two possible subsets in this case are {0, 1} and {0, 2}. In both cases the XOR-sum (1 and 2 respectively) contains exactly one set bit.
Example case 3. The only possible subset is {1, 2}.
