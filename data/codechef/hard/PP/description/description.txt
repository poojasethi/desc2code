Given a list of strings S[ 1..N ], you need to count how many ordered pairs of strings are awesome. Given two integers i and j, such that 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n and i ≠ j, an ordered pair ( S[ i ], S[ j ] ) is called awesome if and only if concatenating S[ i ] and S[ j ] gives a palindrome.

Input
The first line contains an integer T denoting the total number of test cases.
In each test case, the first line contains an integer N denoting the total number of strings.
Then, there are N strings, each in a separate line. They only consist of lower case characters.

Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the answer.

Constraints

1 <= T <= 5
In each test case,
1 <= N <= 10^6
Sum of lengths of N strings <= 10^6


Example
Input:
1
3
a
ab
abb

Output:
2

Explanation
ab|a and abb|a
