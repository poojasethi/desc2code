Chef has had a recipe. He had written it as a sequence of N integer numbers A[1], A[2], ..., A[N]. To be on the safe side, he decided to write out M triples of numbers, where i-th triple is composed of three numbers Xi, Yi and Zi. It means that the sum of numbers in the recipe from Xi-th to Yi-th is equal to Zi. In other words, A[Xi] +  A[Xi + 1] + ... + A[Yi] = Zi. Unfortunately, the recipe has been recently lost. So Chef needs to restore his recipe using these M triples. Your task is to help him.


Input
The first line contains two space separated integer numbers N and M.
Then M lines follow. Each line contains three space separated integer numbers Xi, Yi and Zi. It means that the sum of numbers in the recipe from Xi-th to Yi-th is equal to Zi.


Output
If there is a solution output N space separated integer numbers - the sequence that you have restored. If there are several solutions you can output any of them. However, any number in the output should be no more than 10^14 by its absolute value. If it is impossible to restore the sequence output "-1" without quotes.


Constraints

2 ≤ N ≤ 65536
1 ≤ M ≤ 200000
1 ≤ Xi ≤ Yi ≤ N
|Zi| ≤ 1000000000 (10^9)
If It is possible to restore the sequence then there is way to do this such that every number in the restored sequence is in range [-10000; 10000]


Example

Input 1:
4 4
1 2 3
2 3 1
3 4 -2
1 4 1                                                                            

Output 1:
1 2 -1 -1

Input 2:
5 3
1 3 4
4 5 6
1 5 9 

Output 2:
-1


Explanation
In the first test case the answer is not unique. Possible answers are also {0, 3, -2, 0}, {2, 1, 0, -2} and many others.

In the second test case first two conditions imply A[1] + A[2] + A[3] = 4 and A[4] + A[5] = 6 and hence A[1] + A[2] + A[3] + A[4] + A[5] = (A[1] + A[2] + A[3]) + (A[4] + A[5]) = 4 + 6 = 10. And it contradicts to the third condition. Hence it is impossible to restore the recipe.
