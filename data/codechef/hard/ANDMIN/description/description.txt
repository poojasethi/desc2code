You are given an array of N integers. You should support the following queries on this array.

0 L R : Find the minimum integer in the range AL, AL+1, ..., AR.
1 L R X :  You should apply the assignment A[i] = A[i] & X, for all indices i in range [L, R], where & denotes bitwise AND operation.


Input
First line of the input contains two space separated integers N and Q.
Second line contains N integer numbers denoting array A.
In the next Q lines, each contain one of the queries described above.

Output
For each query of the type 0, output  a single line containing the answer of the query.

Constraints

1 ≤ N, Q ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ Ai, X ≤ 10^9
1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ N
