Alice uses the following pseudocode when she needs to sort a permutation of N positive integers:

procedure Sort(list A) defined as: 
   list less, greater
   if length(A) <= 1 then return A
   pivot := A(length(A)+1) / 2
   for i := 1 to length(A) do:
      Increment(comparison_count)
      if Ai < pivot then append Ai to less else if Ai > pivot append Ai to greater
      end if
   end for
   return concatenate(Sort(less), pivot, Sort(greater) )

And now we are interested in the number of comparisons that will be made during the sorting of the given permutation of integers A with the provided code. So, we ask you to find the value of the variable comparison_count after such a sorting.


Input
The first line of input consists of a single integer N. The second line of input contains a permutation of N numbers. 

Output
Output the number of comparisons on the first and only line of the output.

Example
Input:
5
4 3 5 1 2

Output:
11

Scoring
Subtask 1 (32 points): 1 <= N <= 2000. 
Subtask 2 (9 points): 1 <= N <= 10^5, the permutation is generated randomly.
Subtask 3 (45 points): 1 <= N <= 65536. 
Subtask 4 (14 points): 1 <= N <= 5*10^5.
