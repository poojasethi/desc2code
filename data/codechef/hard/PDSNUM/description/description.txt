A positive integer is called a "PDS Number" if the product of its digits is divisible by the sum of its digits. Let PDS(N) be the N-th PDS Number (indexed from 1), you are requested to calculate it.


Input
There are several test cases (at most 10000), each formed as follows:

The first and only line contains a positive integer N (N â‰¤ 10^9).

The input is ended by N = 0.



Output
For each test case, output on a line the respective PDS(N) calculated.


Example
