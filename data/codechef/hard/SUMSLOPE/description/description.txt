A digit in a number N is a minima if it is lesser than both the digits adjacent to it. Similarly, a digit is a maxima if it is greater than both the digits adjacent to it. The slope of N is the number of digits in N (leaving out the first and the last digit) which are either a minima or a maxima. Given A and B, count the sum of the slopes of all numbers between A and B.


Input :


The first line contains the number of test cases T. Each of the next T lines contains two integers A and B.


Output :


Output T lines one for each test case, containing the required sum for the corresponding test case.
