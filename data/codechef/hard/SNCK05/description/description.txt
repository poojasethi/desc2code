"...a composition of a positive integer n is a way of writing n as a sum of strictly positive integers. Two sums which differ in the order of their summands are deemed to be different compositions, while they would be considered to be the same partition."

- Quote from Wikipedia

How many compositions of a number n are with summands either 1 or 2.


Input
The first line contains a number, the number of test cases (<= 1000000). Each subsequent line contains a number n (<= 1000000000).


Output
For test case print the solution mod 1000000007 on a new line.


Example
