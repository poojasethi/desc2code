You are given a tree of N nodes numbered from 1 to N.
The i^th edge connecting node ui and vi has a weight of wi.


Your target is to handle the queries of the following two types:


"1 i c" : Update the weight of i^th edge with the new weight c.
  (1 represents the query type).
 

"2 u v" : Find the length of the path from node u to v. (2 represents the query type).


Input

The first line contains a single integer N.
Each of the next N - 1 lines contains three integers u v w, representing an edge
  between u and v with the weight of w.
The next line contains a single integer Q representing the number of queries
Each of the next Q lines contains three integers representing a query as described above.


Output

For each query of type 2, output the answer in a single line.


Constraints
All test:

1 ≤ i < N
1 ≤ u, v ≤ N; u ≠ v
1 ≤ w, c ≤ 10^4

40 points:

1 ≤ N, Q ≤ 10^3

60 points:

1 ≤ N, Q ≤ 10^5


Example
Input:
5
1 2 2
2 3 4
4 2 3
5 4 1
3
2 5 3
1 3 1
2 5 3

Output:
8
6


Explanation
The path from 5 to 3 is 5 -> 4 -> 2 -> 3. Initially this path has the length of 1 + 3 + 4 = 8.
After the weight of the edge connect 4 and 2 was changed to 1, the new length of the path is 1 + 1 + 4 = 6.
