Chef sometimes suffers from insomnia. During sleepless nights, he often plays this game: He creates an array A of N integers and also decides one integer K. After that, he tries to count the number of non-empty contiguous subsequences (subsegments) of A, such that there are no bad pairs of integers in this subsegment. A pair (x, y) of integers is called bad if x is situated to the left of y in the array and x mod y = K. Finally, before going to sleep, Chef wrote down the answer on a sheet of paper. Sadly, he has forgotten it this morning and want your help regarding that.

Input

The first line contains two integers - N and K.
Second line contains N integers - A1, A2 ... AN - separated by spaces, denoting the array A.


Output
A single line containing an integer - the answer to the problem.

Constraints

1 ≤ N, Ai ≤ 10^5 
0 ≤ K ≤ 10^5 


Example
Input:
3 2
5 3 1

Output:
4

Explanation:
We can check 5 mod 3 = 2, 5 mod 1 = 0 and 3 mod 1 = 0. Thus (5, 3) is the only bad pair in the array. The 4 subsegments A[1;1] = {5}, A[2;2] = {3}, A[3;3] = {1}, A[2;3] = {3, 1} are OK. The other subsegments A[1;2] = {5, 3}, A[1;3] = {5, 3, 1} have a bad pair.
