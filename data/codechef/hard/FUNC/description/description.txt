 Chef has just been introduced to functions and he has been experimenting a lot with the different kinds of functions. In the process, the chef has come up with an interesting problem for you. 
 Chef defines a function  root(i, x)  which gives the greatest integer less than or equal to the  i ^th  root of a positive integer  x . For example,  root(2, 4)  is   2  and  root(2, 2)  is  1 .  
 Now the chef defines another function  val(x, A, N)  as follows :  
 val(x, A, N) =  root(1, x)*A[1]  +  root(2, x)*A[2] +  ...  + root(N, x)*A[N]   
where  A  is an array of integers of size  N  (indexed from 1 onwards)  and  x  is a positive integer.

 You are given the array  A  and its size  N . You need to find out the value of  val(x, A, N)  for several values of  x . Since this number can be very large, print the result modulo  10^9 + 7 .


Input
 The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each test case begins with a line containing two integers N and  Q  denoting the size of array A and the number of queries. The second line of each test case consists of N space separated integers where the i^th integer represents A[i]. The third line of each test case consists of Q space separated integers denoting the value of  x  for the i^th query.


Output
 For each test case, print in a single line  Q  integers, where the i^th integer represents the answer to the i^th  query. ( i.e  val(x, A, N) % ( 10^9 + 7 )  )


Constraints

 1 ≤ T ≤   10 
 1  ≤  N  ≤  10^4 
 1  ≤  Q  ≤  15000
 -10^9  ≤  A[i]   ≤  10^9 
 1  ≤  x   ≤  10^18   for each number in the query. 



Example
Input:
1
3 2
4 5 6
8 30

Output:
54 163


Explanation
Query 1.
 (root(1,8)*4 + root(2,8)*5 + root(3,8)*6) % 1000000007 = (8*4 + 2*5 + 2*6) % 1000000007 = 54 % 1000000007 = 54 


Query 2.
 (root(1,30)*4 + root(2,30)*5 + root(3,30)*6) % 1000000007 = (30*4 + 5*5 + 3*6) % 1000000007 = 163 % 1000000007 = 163
