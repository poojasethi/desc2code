Devu is learning Combinatorics in his college. He find it very interesting to calculate number of ways of going to point (c,d) from point (a,b) in co-ordinate plane. We can take horizontal and vertical steps only and can not visit at a point twice. In a step, you can move one unit only. We have to reach to the point (c,d) from the point (a,b) using abs(a-c)+ abs(b-d) steps only.


Devu has two sets of points. Set A contains points having X co-ordinate 0 and Y co-ordinates varying from 1 to N(both inclusive). Set B contains points having X co-ordinate K and Y co-ordinates varying from 1 to N(both inclusive).  Both sets contains N number of integral points. He wants to calculate the sum of number of ways to going to the each point of set B from the each point of set A .


As the answer can be large, print it modulo 1000000007.


Input

First line of input contains an integer T denoting number of test cases.  
 Next T lines will contain pair of integers N and K

Output
For each test case, print a single integer representing the answer of that test case.

Constraints

Example
Input:
2
2 2
4 5

Output:
8
236


Explanation

For the first sample case,
ways[(0,1)->(2,1)]= 1
ways[(0,2)->(2,2)]= 1
ways[(0,1)->(2,2)]= 3
ways[(0,2)->(2,1)]= 3
So, the total number of ways = 8.
