Given a binary represantation of number N. You are to find how many numbers from 0 to N have even number of ones in their binary represantation.
There is also an update operation, update (L,R), which means that all bits of N from L^th to R^th are flipped, i.e. ones to zeroes and vice versa. You have to also find the answer after each of these updates.


Input
The first line of input file contains binary represantation of number N. The second line contains number M - the number of update queries. Then M lines follow that describe each update query by two numbers - L and R. Note that the digits of N are numbered from left to right. That is, the leftmost(most significant) bit is numbered 1.

Output
Output the answer for initial value of N and also after each of the M updates modulo 10^9+7 in separate lines.

Constraints

 1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤  number of bits in  N ≤ 10^6
 1 ≤ M ≤ 10^5
 all digits of N are either '0' or '1'.


Example
Input:
000
5
3 3
2 3
3 3
2 3
1 3

Output:
1
1
1
2
1
4
 

Explanation
After the final operation, N becomes 7. All numbers in range [0..7] that have even number of ones in their binary representation are: 0, 3, 5 and 6.
