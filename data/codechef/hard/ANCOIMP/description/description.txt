Chef is impressed by mathematical logic and linear algebra. He wants to combine his favorite subjects, so he introduced the concept of logical operations on boolean matrices.
He defines A → B to be a matrix C such that Cij = Aij → Bij and ¬ A to be a matrix B such that Bij = ¬ Aij 
Now Chef wants to study such system of equations: A → X = ¬ O and X → A = O
 Where O is matrix such that all its entries is 0.
However, Chef realized that such system has solution if and only if A = O. Since such solution is too trivial, Chef has decided to search for an approximate solution for arbitrary A. Thus, Chef is searching for such X that A → X = ¬ O and X → A has as much as possible entries which are equal to 0. 
But the solution space turned to be very large, so he reduced it to a matrices of a special form. Now he is looking for X such that Xij = yi xor yj for some boolean vector y. Since now X is symmetric, Chef restricts A to also be symmetric.
 Help Chef to resolve this difficult problem, or say that there is no solution.
 Here → denotes the logical implication. p → q = !p || (p && q). Here ¬ denotes logical negation. ¬p = !p 

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the size of A. The next N lines contain N space-separated integers A[i]1, A[i]2, ..., A[i]N denoting the i-th row of matrix A.
It's guaranteed that A is symmetric.

Output
 For each test case, output a single line containing N integers - vector y, described in the statement, if there is a solution, or -1, if there is not. In case there are several solutions, print any solution.

Explanation
Example case 1.

Matrix which is determined by vector y is 

0 0 1 1
0 0 1 1
1 1 0 0
1 1 0 0
 
Then A → X = ¬ O and X → A is

1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1
0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1

Example case 2.

A11 = 1 and X11 = y1 xor y1 = 0. So A11 → X11 = 0 and condition A → X = ¬ O can not be satisfied.
