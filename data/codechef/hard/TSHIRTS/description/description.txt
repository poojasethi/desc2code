Input
First line of the input contains a single integer  T  denoting number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.
For each test case, first line contains an integer N, denoting the total number of persons. Each of the next N lines contains at least 1 and at most 100 space separated distinct integers, denoting the ID's of the T-Shirts i^th person has.

Output
For each test case, print in single line the required number of ways modulo 1000000007 = 10^9+7.
