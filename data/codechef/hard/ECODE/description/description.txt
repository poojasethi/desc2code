Professor X got lost in a maze of an ancient tomb in Egypt. While he was finding the way to escape, he got a message of the tomb builders on the old walls:


The code to open the exit door is the sequence C of n digits formed c1..cn (ci∈[0,9] ).
For every sequence C, combining with the given integers A,B, call:

h0
hii-1×A+ci)  mod B

The smallest sequence C (in lexicological order) satisfying hn

Request
Give the integers n,A,B,G, help professor X find out the exit code!


Input
One and only line contains the integers n,A,B,G, respectively, each of them is separated with at least one space character.

Output
Output in a single line the exit code found.

Example
Input:

3 11 111 92

Output:

084


Limitations

1≤n≤12
10≤A,B≤10^15
0≤G<B
The input satisfies that the answer always exist.
