In this problem Sereja is interested in the number of arrays of integers, A1, A2, ..., AN, with 1 ≤ Ai ≤ M, such that the greatest common divisor of all of its elements is equal to a given integer D.
Find the sum of answers to this problem with D = L, D = L+1, ..., D = R, modulo 10^9+7.

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T - the number of test cases. T tests follow, each containing a single line with the values of N, M, L, R.

Output
For each test case output the required sum, modulo 10^9+7.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ M


Example

Input:
2
5 5 1 5
5 5 4 5

Output:
3125
