Divyam is teaching his student Amit about palindromes. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward or forward. For example, the string “abcba” is a palindrome. After teaching about it, Divyam gave a puzzle for Amit to solve:


Given a string S. Find the number of positions in S where we can insert a character to convert it into a palindrome. Character can be inserted in the beginning or the end, so there will be (N+1) possible positions for the insertion in a string having original length N. For example, if S = “aaa”, then there are four positions where we can insert a character so that the converted string is a palindrome. Converted palindromes are “aaaa”, “aaaa”, “aaaa” and “aaaa”. Inserted character is shown in boldface.


Amit finds the puzzle too difficult. Can you help him in solving it?


Input

First line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
First line of each test case will contain a string S containing lowercase letters only. 


Output
Print T lines, each containing an integer: the solution for the corresponding test case.
