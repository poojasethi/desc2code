Given N and M Dexter wants to know how many pairs a,b(1 <= a < b <=N) are there such that (a+b) is divisible by M.
For example when N=4 and M=3, there are 2 possible pairs the sum of which is divisible by M  and they are (1,2) and (2,4).



Input

First line of input contains T(<=100000) which is the number of test cases. Each of the next T lines contains two integers N(1 <= N <= 10^9) and M(2 <= M <= 10^9).


Output

Output one line per testcase, the number of pairs (a,b) as described before.


Example

Input:
3
2 3
4 3
1 6

Output:
1
2
0
