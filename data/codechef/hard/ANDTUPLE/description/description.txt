A pair of non-negative integers (A,B) is called and-pair if A & B = B, i.e., bitwise-and of A and B is equal to B. Similarly, a tuple of K non-negative integers (A1,A2,A3 .. AK) is called and-tuple if Ai & Ai+1 = Ai+1 for 1≤i≤K-1.
Given two integers N and K, how many and-tuples of size K exist such that the sum of the elements of the tuple is N?

Input
First line contains T, the number of testcases, then T lines follow. Each of the following lines contain two space-separated integers K and N.

Output
For each testcase, print a single line containing the answer. Since the number can be quite large, print the answer modulo 1000000009.

Constraints

For 20 points: 1 ≤ T ≤ 10000, K = 3, 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^18For 80 points: 1 ≤ T ≤ 10000, 3 ≤ K ≤ 4, 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^18

Example
Input:
23 24 2Output:
22Explanation:

In the first case, the two and-tuples are (2,0,0) and (1,1,0).
In the second case they are (2,0,0,0) and (1,1,0,0).
