 Given a sequence of positive integers a1,
a2, …, aN, and 1 ≤

i ≤ j ≤ N, the partial sum from
i to j is ai +

ai+1 + … + aj.
 In this problem, you will be given such a sequence and two
integers P and K. Your task is to find the smallest
partial sum modulo P that is at least K.

For example, consider the following sequence of integers:

    12     13     15     11     16     26     11


 Here N = 7. Suppose K = 2 and P = 17.
Then, the answer is 2 because 11+16+26 = 53 and 53 mod 17 is 2.  On
the other hand, if K = 0 the answer is 0 since 15 + 11 + 16 +
26 = 68 and 68 mod 17 is 0.
Input format
The first line contains three integers N, K and
P.  This is followed by N lines each containing a
single integer.
You may assume 1  ≤ N  ≤ 100000.
Output format
A single integer indicating the minimum possible segment sum modulo
P that is at least K.
