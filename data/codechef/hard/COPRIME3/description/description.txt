You are given a sequence a1, a2, ..., aN. Count the number of triples (i, j, k) such that 1 ≤ i < j < k ≤ N and GCD(ai, aj, ak) = 1. Here GCD stands for the Greatest Common Divisor.

Input
The first line of input contains a single integer N - the length of the sequence.
The second line contains N space-separated integers - a1, a2, ..., aN respectively.

Output
Output the required number of triples on the first line of the output.

Constraints


1 ≤ N ≤ 100 : 22 points.
1 ≤ N ≤ 1000 : 23 points.
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 : 55 points.
1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^6


Example
Input:
4
1 2 3 4

Output:
4
 

Explanation
Any triple will be a coprime one.
