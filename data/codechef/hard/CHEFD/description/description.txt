Chef has an array containing N integers. You have to make M queries. Each query has one of the two types:

1 l r p - Select all the numbers having indices between l and r (inclusive) that are divisible by p and divide them by p,
  where p is in set {2, 3, 5}.
2 l d - Modify the l-th number in the array to d.


Please help Chef in finding out the array after all the M queries.


Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer N denoting the number of integers in given array. 
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the given array.
Next line contains a single integer M denoting the number of queries.
Each of the following M lines describes a single query in the format given in the statement.

Output
 Output a single line containing N integers denoting the array after all the M queries.

Constraints

1 ≤ M ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ N
1 ≤ Ai ≤ 10^9
In each query of first type, p is in set {2, 3, 5} 
Example

Input:
3
1 2 3
5
1 2 2 2
1 2 2 2
2 2 3
