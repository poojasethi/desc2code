A triangle is acute if all its internal angles are acute (< 90^o). You are given a set of N points on a 2D plane. Calculate the number of acute triangles that can be formed using points from the set as vertices. 
Two triangles are different if the set of three vertices of one triangle is not equal to the set of three vertices of the other triangle. 

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer N, the number of points in the set. Each of the next N lines contains two space separated integers which are the x and y coordinates of points in the set.

Output
Output a single line containing the number of acute triangles.

Constraints

 3 ≤ N ≤ 2000
 The x, y coordinate of each point satisfies 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 10,000 
 All points are distinct.
