A permutation of N distinct integers between 1 and N, both inclusive, is called a prime permutation of size N iff - for all i between 1 and N, the following condition holds:
The i^th integer is the X^th smallest integer in the first i integers, where X is either 1 or a prime number.
Your task is to find out how many prime permutations are there of size N.

Input
The first line contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then T lines follow, each containing a single integer N.

Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the number of prime permutations of size N. Since the answers can be very large, output each answer modulo 1,000,000,007.
