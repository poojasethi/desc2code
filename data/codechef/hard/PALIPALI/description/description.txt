A string is called beautiful if it has the form AA^rAA^r where A is some non-empty string and A^r is the reversed A.
You are given a string S composed only of lowercase letters of the English alphabet. Find the number of its beautiful substrings. Equal substrings in different positions are considered different. For example, the string aaaaa has 2 different substrings because we have beautiful substring aaaa in two different positions.


Input
 The first line contains a single integer T <= 10, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The only line of each test case contains a non-empty string composed only of lowercase letters of the English alphabet. The length of the string is not greater than 100000.


Output
 For each test case, output a single line containing the number of beautiful substrings of the corresponding string.
