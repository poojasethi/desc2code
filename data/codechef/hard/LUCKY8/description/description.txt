 A Little Elephant from the Zoo of Lviv likes lucky numbers very much. Everybody knows that the lucky numbers are positive integers whose decimal representation contains only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not.

 Let F4(X) be the number of digits 4 in the decimal representation of X, and F7(X) be the number of digits 7 in the decimal representation of X. For example, F4(456) = 1, F4(444) = 3, F7(1) = 0, F7(747) = 2. The Little Elephant wants to know the largest product F4(X) ∙ F7(X), where L ≤ X ≤ R. In other words he wants to know the value
 max{F4(X) ∙ F7(X) : L ≤ X ≤ R}.


Input
 The first line of the input file contains an integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The only line of each test case contains two integers L and R separated by exactly one space.


Output
 For each test case output a single line containing the answer for the corresponding test case.


Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 1000

1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ 10^18

Example

Input:
3
1 10
1 100
47 74

Output:
0
1
1


Explanation
In both second and third test cases the maximal product is achieved at the numbers 47 and 74.
