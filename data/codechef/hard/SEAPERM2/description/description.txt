Sereja have permutation p[1], p[2], ..., p[n]. Sereja have made n permutations q[1], q[2], ..., q[n], q[i] is permutation p without element i (we subtract 1 from all elements bigger than i). For example 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 without 5 is 7 1 2 3 4 5 6. Sereja have made random shuffle of q. Help Sereja find initial permutation p.

Input
First line contain number of test cases T. T tests follow. First line of each test case contain number n. Next n lines describe permutations q[1], q[2], ..., q[n]. Each line contain n-1 number. It is guarantied that there is at least one solution for each test case.
 

Output
For each test output permutation p. If there is more than one solution - output any.
 

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤  10 
3 ≤ n ≤  300
