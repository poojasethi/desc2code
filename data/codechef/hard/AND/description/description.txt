You are given a sequence of N integer numbers A. Calculate the sum of Ai AND Aj for all the pairs (i, j) where i < j. 
 The AND operation is the Bitwise AND operation, defined as in here. 

Input
The first line of input consists of the integer N. 
The second line contains N integer numbers - the sequence A.

Output
Output the answer to the problem on the first line of the output.

Example
Input:
5
1 2 3 4 5

Output:
9


Scoring

Subtask 1 (13 points): N <= 1000, Ai <= 1. 
Subtask 2 (39 points): N <= 1000, Ai <= 10^9. 
Subtask 3 (21 points): N <= 10^5, Ai <= 1. 
Subtask 4 (27 points): N <= 10^5, Ai <= 10^6.
