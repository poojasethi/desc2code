Problem Statement
City of Byteland can be described as a 2D grid of cells. Each cell may or may not contain a demon. You are given the list of cells that contain demons.
In a single Kamehameha attack, Goku can kill all the demons stading in a row or in a column. But using Kamehameha drains Goku's power. You are to tell the minimum number of Kamehameha attacks that will be required by Goku to destroy all the demons.

Input
The first line contains T the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains N the number of cells where enemies are present. The following N lines contain two integers X and Y each describing the index of the cell in which the demon is present.

Output
For each case print the minimum number of attacks that are needed to kill all the monsters.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ N ≤ 1000
1 ≤ X, Y ≤ 10^9
