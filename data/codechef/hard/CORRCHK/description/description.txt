Run has given you a list of statements of the form "A+B=C", where A, B and C consist only of decimal digits and small latin letters from 'a' to 'f'. Moreover, the first symbol of A, B, C is always not a zero and the length of A, B, C is not greater than 8.  How many statements have an integer Q in the range [2; 16] such that A+B equals to C in the base Q?

Input
The first line of input consists of an integer T - the number of statements. Then, T statements in the form "A+B=C" (without any spaces) follow, each on a separate line.

Output
Output an answer to the problem of the first line of output.

Example
Input:
3
2+2=10
1+2=a
3+5=8

Output:
2

Scoring
T = 10^5, Every statement is either true in the base 10, either false in all the bases : 50 points.
T = 10^5, No additional constraints : 50 points.Â
