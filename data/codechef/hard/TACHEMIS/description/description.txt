After the first chemistry lesson, Ron realized that the simplest way to compress a string of Latin characters is to write it down as a list of pairs of character and integer. This is done by writing each segment of identical characters as the character and the length of the segment.
For example the string s = "AABBBCCCC" can be compressed as [ ('A', 2), ('B', 3), ('C', 4) ].
In compressed notation, two consecutive pairs cannot have same character. For example [('A', 2), ('A', 4)] is invalid and its correct representation is [('A', 6)]. Ron has written down a string in compressed notation, and he wants to count the number of sub-strings (a segment of consecutive characters) of the original string that are palindromes.


Recall that a palindrome is a non-empty string that reads the same backward as forward. Two sub-strings are considered to be different if they have different lengths or start at different positions in the original string.


Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. 
Each test case gives a string in compressed notation. The first line of each test case contains an integer K, the number of (character, integer) pairs in compressed notation. Each of the next K lines contains a single character, followed by a space, followed by a positive integer, the i^th line being the i^th pair in the list.

Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the corresponding answer.


Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10,000(10^4)
1 ≤ K ≤ 100,000(10^5)
Each character is an upper-case Latin character, i.e. 'A' through 'Z'.
The length of the original string does not exceed 1,000,000,000(10^9)
The sum of the Ks over all test cases will not exceed 1,000,000(10^6)


Example
Input:
3
2
A 2
B 2
3
A 2
B 1
A 2
1
A 11

Output:
6
9
66


Explanation

Example case 1: 
The original string is AABB so the sub-strings
(represented by positions of the first and the last character) which are palindromes are (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4) and (4, 4).


Example case 2: 
The original string is AABAA. The sub-strings that are palindromes are the 4 sub-strings A, the 2 sub-strings AA and the sub-strings B, ABA and AABAA. Together, they make 9 palindromes.


Example case 3: 
The original string is A repeated 11 times, so all the sub-strings are palindromes.
