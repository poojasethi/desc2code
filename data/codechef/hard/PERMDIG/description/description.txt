You are given three positive integers A, B and C written in base X <= 10 without leading zeros. In how many ways you can permute the digits of A and permute the digits of B such that their sum will be equal to C (in base X of course)? Leading zeros after permutation are allowed. So for example for A=101 written in some base all possible ways to permute its digits are: 011, 101, 110.

Remark. For positive integer A and base X >= 2 the digits of A in base X are uniquely determined by the equality A = Ak * X^k + Ak-1 * X^k - 1 + ... + A1 * X + A0  and inequalities 0 <= A0, A1, ..., Ak < X and Ak > 0 . Then A is written as 0...0AkAk-1...A1A0 in base X. Here an arbitrary non-negative number of leading zeros is allowed. If there are no leading zeros we say that A is written in canonical form.


Input
 The first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The only line of each test case contains four space separated positive integers X, A, B and C, where A, B, C is written in base X without leading zeros (that is in canonical form). 

Output
 For each test case, output a single line containing the number of possible permutations of digits of A and B such that their sum is equal to C. 

Constraints

1 <= T <= 10

2 <= X <= 10

1 <= len(A), len(B), len(C) <= 80/X

where len(N) stands for  the number of digits of number N when it is written in base X in canonical form. 

Example

Input:
5
2 10 10 11
3 2 2 11
10 101 12 23
10 10 100 1000
10 43716 70251864 71130699

Output:
2
1
1
0
4


Explanation
In the first case the appropriate ways are 01+10=11 and 10+01=11.

In the third case the only appropriate way is 011+12=23.
