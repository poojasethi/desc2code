Chef has an array A[] of N elements denoted by A0, A1, ..., AN-1.
He thinks about M questions of following kind: "What is the maximum element among Ai where i lies between min{x, y} and max{x, y} both inclusive?"
You have to help Chef to find out sum of answers of all the M questions.
Method of generation of values x and y for all M questions: 
You are given two integers x1 and y1 denoting values of x and y for the first question. 
For the next questions, values of xi and yi are generated in the following way:

for i = 2 to M:
	xi = (xi-1 + 7) mod (N - 1)
	yi = (yi-1 + 11) mod N
 
Here a mod b denotes the remainder of division of a by b.

Input
The first line contains a single integer N, denoting the number of elements in the array.
The second line contains N space-separated integers, denoting A0, A1, ..., AN-1. 
The third line contains three space-separated integers M, x1 and y1.

Output
Output a single integer denoting the sum of the answers to the questions.

Constraints and Example
Input:
3
1 2 3
3 0 1

Output:
7

Explanation
The first question: x1 = 0, y1 = 1      =>     ans1 = 2
The second question: x2 = (0 + 7) mod 2 = 1, y2 = (1 + 11) mod 3 = 0       =>       ans2 = 2
The third question: x3 = (1 + 7) mod 2 = 0, y3 = (0 + 11) mod 3 = 2      =>       ans3 = 3
 
As ans1 + ans2 + ans3 = 2 + 2 + 3 = 7. So you have to print 7.
