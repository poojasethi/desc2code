A 1-concave polygon is a simple polygon (its sides don't intersect or touch) which has at least 1 concave interior angle.
There are N points on a plane. Let S be the maximum area of a 1-concave polygon with vertices in those points. Compute 2S. Note that if there is no such (1-concave) polygon, you should print -1.

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T - the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains N - the number of points.
Each of the following N lines contains two integers x and y - the coordinates of a point.


Output
If there's no 1-concave polygon, print -1. Otherwise, print one integer: twice the area of the largest one (it's guaranteed to be an integer under these constraints).

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
3 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
No two points coincide (have identical both x and y coordinates).
No three points are collinear.
The sum of N over all test cases won't exceed 5·10^5.
|x|,|y| ≤ 10^9
