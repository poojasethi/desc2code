Given the lengths of the edges of a tetrahedron
calculate the radius of a sphere inscribed in that tetrahedron
(i.e. a sphere tangent to all the faces).

Input

An integer t, 1 ≤ t ≤ 30, denoting the number of test cases, followed by t lines, each containing 6 integers describing the lengths of the edges of a tetrahedron
separated by single spaces. The edges are not longer than 1000 and
for the tetrahedron WXYZ, the order of the edges is: WX, WY, WZ, XY, XZ, YZ.

Output

t lines, each consisting of a real number given with four digits decimal precision
equal to the radius of a sphere inscribed in the given tetrahedron.
