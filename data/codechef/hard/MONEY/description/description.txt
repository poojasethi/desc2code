The Government of Byteland has decide to issue new currency notes with special protection features to so as to commemorate a great mathematician.
 

It has decided to issue notes summing up to N and all the sums from 1 to N should only made by selecting some of the notes in only one unique way.

With n = 5 the sets {1,1,1,1,1}, {1,2,2}, {1,1,3} are valid. Invalid sets are

-{1,1,1,2} because 2 can be made by {1,1} and {2}and also 3 by {1,1,1} and {1,2}

-{1,2,4} because all from 1 to 5 can be uniquely made but the sum is not 5.



Input

First line contains T(1 ≤ T ≤ 1000) the number of test cases. Each test case contains a integer N ( ≤ 10^9) in one line.


Output

Output the solution of each test case on a line.


Example

Input:
2
10
1000

Output:
1
13
