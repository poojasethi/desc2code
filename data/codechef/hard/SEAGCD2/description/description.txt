Sereja asks you to find out number of arrays A of size N, i.e. A1, A2, ..., AN (1 ≤ Ai ≤ M), such that for each pair i, j (1 ≤ i < j ≤ N) gcd(Ai, Aj) = 1.


As the answer could be large, print it modulo 10^9 + 7 (1000000007).


Input

First line of the input contain an integer T - number of test cases.

T tests follow. First line of each test case contain two space separated integers N, M.


Output

For each test case output required answer modulo 10^9 + 7.


Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤  10 
1 ≤ N ≤  10^5 
1 ≤ M ≤  100 


Example
Input:
2
1 1
3 3

Output:
