Chef is now off his restaurant hard-work, but that doesn't mean he is allowed to rest... After all, he will be hosting a dinner to his cousins who came visit him all the way from Gigaland (as we know, Chef lives in Byteland).
Once they arrived, Chef got a bit worried as he saw that they were bringing along their loud children with them... Besides all the noise, he would even have to cook extra food, so he decided to keep children busy and gave them two strings S1 and S2. He also has an integer L, which he gave to the children as well.

For a string S=c1 c2 ... cN, let S[a,b] denote ca ca+1 ... cb-1 cb, that is, the substring starting at a^th character and ending at b^th character. For each 1 ≤ i ≤ L, chef wants the children to know how many tuples (a, b, c, d) exist for which S1[a, b] = S2[c, d] and length of S1[a,b] is i.
Hopefully Chef will be able to cook in peace now :) 

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a the string S1. The second contains the string S2. The third line contains the integer L.

Output
For each test case, output a single line containing L space separated integers, where the i^th integer is number of common substrings of length i.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 15
All strings are composed of characters a-z.
length of any string ≤ 2*10^5
In any test file, the sum of lengths of all strings is at most 2*10^6


Example

Input:
4
abcd
abcd
3
abab
babc
4
abcbca
acccca
5
abxyz
xyzab
4

Output:
4 3 2
6 3 1 0
12 1 0 0 0
5 3 1 0

Explanation
Example case 2. Common substrings of length 1 are (a,b,c,d) = (0,0,1,1), (2,2,1,1), (1,1,0,0), (1,1,2,2), (3,3,0,0), (3,3,2,2).
Common substrings of length 2 are (0, 1, 1, 2), (1, 2, 0, 1), (2, 3, 1, 2).
Common substrings of length 3 are (1, 3, 0, 2).
There is no common substring of length 4.
