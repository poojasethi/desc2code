Johnny has invented a magic sequence. Each element of the sequence is defined by the same recursive definition - take some linear combination of previous elements (whose coefficients are fixed) and add to them the n-th powers of some integers. Formally: Xn = Xn-1*a1 + ... + Xn-i*ai + b1*d1^n + ... + bj*dj^n, for some integer constants p,q,a1,...,ap,b1,..., bq,d1,..., dq. Of course, as the values can quickly grow, he computed them modulo a fixed value: 10^6. He wrote many consecutive values of the sequence, but then he lost most of his work. All he has now, is 10 consecutive values taken from somewhere in the sequence (he doesn't know at what n they begin), and the recursive rule. And he would like to recover the sequence, or at the very least, to be able to write the next 10 values taken from the sequence.

Input
First, two integers, 0≤p≤4, 0≤q≤4. Then come the descriptions of the coefficients, -100 ≤ a1,...,ap,b1,..., bq,d1,..., dq ≤ 100. Then, the following 10 integers are Xn,Xn+1,...,Xn+9 for some unknown n.

Output
Output 10 integers - Xn+10,Xn+11,...,Xn+19
