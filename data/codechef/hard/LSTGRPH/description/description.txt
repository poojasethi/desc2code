	Mike is given an undirected graph G of N vertices and M edges. A non-negative integer Xi is assigned to the i'th vertex of G, for 1 ≤ i ≤ N.


	Mike was asked to assign labels to each edge of the graph so that the following condition is satisfied:


	Let's suppose that the j'th edge of G connects vertices Uj and Vj. Then, a non-negative integer Yj equals to XUj xor XVj.


	This challenge was too easy for Mike and he solved it quickly.


	The next day, Mike started to worry that he had solved the problem too quickly and had made a lot of mistakes, so he decided to double-check his answers. To his horror, Mike discovered that all the values of Xi had been lost!


	Mike is a very meticulous person and he doesn't like making mistakes, so he decided to create his own values of Xi that still produce the same values of Yj.


	Your task is to determine whether it is possible to do so. If it is, you should output the K'th lexicographically valid sequence (X1, X2, ..., XN) that satisfies the above conditions, knowing the structure of G and all the values Yj.


Note

	Maybe some of you aren't familiar with some terms in the statement. Here are some articles that could help you understand the problem correctly:

XOR operation: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or


	Also, the stack memory size is quite limited on CodeChef, so a deep recursion may lead to the Runtime Error verdict.


Input

	The first line of the input contains the integers N, M and K.


	The next M lines describe the edges of G; the j'th line contains three integers Uj, Vj and Yj.


	It's guaranteed that G doesn't contain multiple edges and loops.


Output

	If there is no valid labelling, or less than K valid labellings, the only line of the output should contain -1. Otherwise, the only line of the output should contain N non-negative integers, denoting the K'th lexicographically valid sequence (X1, X2, ..., XN).


	It's guaranteed that in the correct sequence all of the values of Xi won't exceed the 32-bit signed integer limit.


Constraints
1 ≤ N ≤ 200,000(2 × 10^5);
0 ≤ M ≤ 300,000(3 × 10^5);
1 ≤ K ≤ 1,000,000,000(10^9);
1 ≤ Uj ≠ Vj ≤ N;
0 ≤ Yj < 2^31.

Example
Input:
5 4 2
1 2 5
1 3 9
2 4 0
2 5 1

Output:
1 4 8 4 5 


Explanation

	The first lexicographically valid sequence is equal to (0, 5, 9, 5, 4);
	The second lexicographically valid sequence is equal to (1, 4, 8, 4, 5) - that's the one that should be printed out as the answer.
