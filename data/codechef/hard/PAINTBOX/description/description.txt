Anup has N boxes. He painted them.
He wants to pick W adjacent boxes and give it to Suraj on his birthday. He wants all the W boxes he gifts to be of same colour. Anup repaints some of the boxes, and asks how many ways are there to gift  W boxes to Suraj. Can you please help him out? 

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a two integers N denoting the number of boxes and W denoting the number of adjacent boxes that he wants to gift Suraj. The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the initial colours of the boxes. 
Third line of each test case contains a single integer Q, denoting the number of times Anup repainted a box. Q lines follow, each containing two integers Posi and Coli meaning that Pos^th box was repainted with colour Col.


Output

After each repainting query, output the number of ways Anup can gift Suraj W adjacent boxes of the same colour.


Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ W, Pos ≤ N
1 ≤ Ai, Col ≤ 10^9
For 30 points : 1 ≤ Q ≤ 10^3, 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^4
For 70 points : 1 ≤ Q ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5


Example
Input:
1
4 2
1 1 1 1
3
1 1
1 2
2 2

Output:
3
2
2

Explanation

After the first repaint the boxes are coloured (1,1,1,1), which means 3 ways to choose 2 adjacent boxes of the same colour.
After the second repaint the boxes are coloured (2,1,1,1), which means 2 ways to select 2 adjacent boxes of the same colour.
After the third repaint thee boxes are coloured (2,2,1,1), which means 2 ways to select 2 adjacent boxes of the same colour.
