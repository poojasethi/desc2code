Chef recently decided a very curious encryption algorithm for CodeChef passwords. He took an N-letter password and found all the possible
2-letter substrings, considering the characters of a password was written in a circle. Thus, for AbcD, he would deduce the following
substrings: Ab, bc, cD, DA.


Then, some of the substrings were reversed. For example, the set of substrings above could be converted to Ab, cb, Dc, DA. All
the substrings were then stored in a database. Whenever the need be, the substrings were recovered, and a password was generated. Of course
sometimes, more than one such password could be generated, but Chef thinks this is perfectly fine!


Unfortunately, a programming error by the new CodeChef minion, led to corruption of this database and mixed all the strings together.
Chef now wants to retrieve the passwords, a few at a time. He gives you a set of substrings A from some of the passwords - these you
should always consider, and another set of substrings B from which you can use some. Can you tell him if it is possible to select all the substrings
from A and some (0 or more) substrings from B and construct 1 or more passwords? Each selected string can be used only once, for at max 1
password. See explanation of Sample Input for clarification.



Input
The first Line contains a single number T, the number of test cases.


Each test case contains 2 lines.
The first line of the test case contains the number N (= |A|), followed by the N substrings Chef gives in A. The next line contains
M (= |B|), followed by M substrings. Two substrings are input with a single space character between them.



Output
Print T lines, one for each test case. Output either "YES" if it is possible to select all strings from A and some strings from B
such that the overall set of strings represent the substrings for 1 or more passwords. Output "NO" otherwise.



Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 1000
1 ≤ M ≤ 1000
All characters would be upper case or lower case English letters. Passwords are case sensitive.



Sample Input
2
4 aB aB Ca Bc
6 aB Ca ca ab ba bc
4 aB aB Ca Bc
3 Ba aC bc



Sample Output
YES
NO



Explanation
In the first Sample Input, you can construct "aBaC" from (aB aB Ca Ca) and
"aBc" from (Bc aB ca). Strings selected from A are shown in bold. Remember that substrings can be reversed. Note
that although there are repeated strings, each string is used in at most one of the passwords.
