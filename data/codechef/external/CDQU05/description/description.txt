 
Tom likes to find the new math series.Sometimes he modies famous known series .Today he modified the Fibbonacci series and generates a new series named Tom series.  T1 = 0  T2 = 1  T3 = 1*2 + 0*1 = 2  Tn = Tn-1 * (n-1) + Tn-2 * (n-2)  Now Tom wants to count the frequency of given integer K at Nth position in series.
 

Input

First line of input contains a integer T denotes the number of test cases. 
Each T lines conatins two integer values K and N.

 

Output

For each test case print the frequency of the K at Nth position in T series.

 

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 20
0 ≤ K ≤ 100 
3 ≤ N ≤ 21

 

Example
Input:
2
0 13
20 16
Output:
2
1
 

Explanation
Example 
case 1. In the first test case 13th term of the T series will be 1772006854 and frequency of 0 on this number is 2.  case 2. In the second test case 16th term of the T series will be 5874202721042 and frequency of 20 on this number is 1.
