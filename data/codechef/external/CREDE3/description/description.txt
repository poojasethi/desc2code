Everyone knows that electricity travels faster than anything. But we can delay an electric signal if we can make it pass through a grid of dense and resistive wires. So, this is your objective in this 
problem. You are given a square grid consisting of numbers. The numbers in the grid are the seconds by which an electric signal can be delayed if it is made to pass through that particular block in the 
grid (Be careful...Some blocks can actually increase the speed of the grid!!). You can reflect the electric signal from one block to only 3 other blocks as follows:1. to the block immediately below.2. to the block diagonally below left. (i.e. one down and one left)3. to the block diagonally below right. (i.e. one down and one right)
What you need to do is to find the maximum delay that can be introduced in the electric signal. The constraints are that the signal can start at any block belonging only to the top row. And can end at 
any block only at the bottom row.


Input

The first line contains the number of test-cases followed by a blank line. The test cases won't exceed 50 neither would be less than 1. The first line of each input begins with the dimension of the grid. From the next line, the actual grid is provided as an 
input, the blocks in a row separated by a space and the new row on the new-line. There is a blank line between two consecutive inputs. Consider all the inputs as Integers (in accordance with the "int" in C language on a 32-bit system).


Output

The delays introduced in the electric signal for each input should be printed on a new-line.
