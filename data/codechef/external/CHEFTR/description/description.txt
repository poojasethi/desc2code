Input
The first line of input contains the number of test cases, t.
Then t lines follow each containing 2 space separated integers n and k.

Output
The output contains t lines each containing the answer for that particular test case. Each line contains the number triangles that can be formed for that particular test.

Constraints
1<=t<=1000
3<=n<=1000000
3<=k<=n

Example
