You are given two strings A  and B. Find the number of distinct strings which appear in both A  and  B . A string s is said to appear in S iff s is a substring (appears contiguously) of S.


Input


The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.


Each test case consists of two lines.


The first line contains two space separated integers  n1  and  n2  denoting the lengths of  A  and  B.


The second line contains two space separated strings A and B.



Output


For each test case output a single number denoting the number of distinct strings appearing in A and  B .



Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤  10^4  
 1  ≤ n1, n2  ≤  10^5  
 Sum  of n1 + n2  over  all test cases  ≤  10^5  

A is a string consisting of n1 lowercase characters ('a'-'z').


B is a string consisting of n2 lowercase characters ('a'-'z').



Example
Input:
2
3 5
aad zaacd
4 4
abcd lmno
Output:
3
0

Explanation

Example case 1. The three strings are "a", "d", "aa". 

Example case 2. There are no strings that appear in both A and B.
