There are N friends who are playing a computer game with each other . The N friends are sitting in one row of size N .
The person sitting on first bench  has gameid 0, person sitting on second bench has gameid 1, third has gameid 2 and so on ...
But they are not able to complete the game.
So in order to complete the game they started using unfair means like using cheats.
A lot of cheats are available to them. All the cheats are distributed into 3 folders named 1 , 2 , 3.
It is found that when one cheat is being used then it is used by all people who have gameid between i to j  ( both i and j are included ).
When the cheats are used then either the gamepoints of a person increases or decreases.

When the cheats of folder 1 are used by people having gameid between i to j then the gamepoints of person having gameid i increases by one,
gamepoints of person having gameid i + 1 increases by two and gamepoints of person having gameid i + 2 increases by three and so on till j
When the cheats of folder 2 are used by people having gameid between i to j then the gamepoints of all people in the  given range by certain value v.
When the cheats of folder 3 are used by people having gameid between i to j then the gamepoints of all people in the  given range becomes v.
A person comes  and starts to sum the gamepoints . But he was having great difficulty in calculating the sum  as N is very large
so he decided to write a program which could help him but he was not able to write it. 
So you have to help that person by writing a code for him which would help  him .

THE INPUT WILL CONTAIN MANY OPERATIONS . BUT THE OPERATION WILL BE OF 4 TYPE ONLY 
OPERATION 1
1 i j    
(this operation corresponds to cheats of folder 1)

OPERATION 2 
2 i j v  
(this operation corresponds to cheats of folder 2)
  
OPERATION 3
3 i j v 
(this operation corresponds to cheats of folder 3)

OPERATION 4
4 i j 
(this operation corresponds to finding sum of gamepoints from i to j)

INTIALLY  GAMEPOINT OF EVERY PLAYER IS ZERO.

Input
First line contains T( no. of test cases ).
For each test case the first line contains two integer N ( no. of friends ) , Q( no. of operations).
Next Q lines contains operations.


Output
Output the sum of gamepoints of people from id i to j as given in the operation 4. You have to output the sum everytime operation 4 is encountered in a test case.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤  10 
1 ≤ N ≤  10^6 
1 ≤ Q ≤  10^5 
0 ≤ i ≤  j  <  N
-100 ≤ v ≤  100 


Example
Input:
