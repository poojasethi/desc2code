 
Neha loves bangles. One day she goes to the annual fair near the college. There she finds a huge stall of exotic bangles. The vendor has set up N stacks of bangles where the i^th stack has A[i] bangles of beauty values 1,2,3...,A[i]. Neha wants to look the most beautiful among her friends, so she wishes to buy the bangles with the highest beauty value. But she needs to buy only K bangles. Help her select the best K bangles available and find the sum of their beauty values.
 

Input
Input consist of input T, total number of test cases. Then 2T cases follow. Each test case consists of 2 lines.
First line of each test case consists of 2 integers : N and K.
The second line consists of N space separated integers denoting the highest beauty value of each stack.
 

Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the total beauty value of the bangles bought.
 

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ N ≤ 10000
1 ≤ K ≤ 1000000000
1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 1000000000

Sum of A[i] for all 1<=i<=N will always be greater than or equal to K.
