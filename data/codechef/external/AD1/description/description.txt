Prime number one of the simplest concept in our childhood and comes under the basics of maths . Now, cody's teacher has taught him the prime number concept  and he decided to have some fun with it.

Cody knows that
     " a prime number  is a natural number that has exactly two distinct natural number divisors: 1 and itself"


Now, to check if he has learnt the prime number concept, he picked randomly a number n and if the number is prime then "YEAH" or else "NAA" and he has to find next 10 prime numbers



Input

The first line contains t, the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10000).
Followed by t lines which contain values of n(1 ≤n ≤ 10^12)


Output

For every test case if n is a prime number print "YEAH" or else print "NAA" and print 10 successive prime numbers
separated by a single space.


Example

Input:
3
19
63
23497.

Output:
YEAH

NAA
67 71 73 79 83 89 97 101 103 107

YEAH
