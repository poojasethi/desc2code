Problem Description
Utkarsh has come to a new country having N cities(numbered from 1to N). There are M directed roads in the country each of length  1 unit . Utkarsh is very lazy so he cannot walk more thanK units. 
He has Q queries. Each query is of the form  a b . For each query he wants to know how many  different paths  (of  positive length ) are there from city  a to b  which Utkarsh can walk.
Output the answer modulo  10^9+7 .

 INPUT 
First line contains  N,M,K 
next line contains M  pairs a b denoting a directed road from a to b .
Next line contains  Q .
Then Q  pairs follow. 

OUTPUT
For each pair, print the answer to the problem modulo 10^9+7.

CONSTRAINTS 


N<=30
K<=3*10^10
M<=3*10^5
1<=a,b<=N (may contains self loops or multiple edges)
Q<=900
