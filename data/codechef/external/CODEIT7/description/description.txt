After getting placed you went to a party, after the party you got very HIGH. So out of fun you collected all the N (numbered 0 to N-1) dustbins of your hostel and kept them in front of your room. You also bought infinite number of balls, Then initially you added some balls in each dustbin. Now being really high you started these three tasks 
1) You can empty the whole dustbin(D).
2) You can add M number of balls to K^th dustbin
3) You want to know the total number of balls from i^th dustbin to j^th dustbin (both inclusive).


Input
 The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.

Then T test cases follow, each test case will start with integer N and Q, the number of dustbins and number of tasks.
Then in the next line, you will have n integers giving the initial number of balls in each dustbin (which will be less than 1000).
Then Q lines follow, each of the Q lines will contain two or three integers, the first of them will be the task type
If task type is 1, then 1 will be followed by single integer(D), the dustbin to be emptied.
If task type is 2, then 2 will be followed by two integers(K and M), specifying that M balls are to be added to the K^th dustbin.
If task type is 3, then 3 will be followed be two integers(i and j), range for which the total count of number of balls is to be retrieved.


Output
For each test case, 

if the task type is 1, then output the number of balls that have been removed from that dustbin to make it empty and if task type is 3 then output the total number of balls from ith dustbin to jth dustbin.


Constraints

 0 < T <= 5
 0 < N <= 10^5
 0 < Q <= 50000
 0 <= D < N
 0 <= M <= 1000
 0 <= K < N
 0 <= i <= j < N


Example
Input:
1
5 6
3 2 1 4 5
1 4
2 3 4
3 0 3
1 2
3 0 4
1 1

Output:
5
14
1
13
2

Explanation

Example case 1.The first operation is to empty the dustbin 1, we have thus printed 5 (the balls taken from the dustbin to empty it). For the third operation, You are asked the number of balls from dustbins in the range 0 to 3, which give a sum of 14. Similarly for further operations.
