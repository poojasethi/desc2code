There is going to be a Cricket match tonight for which N guests are invited. There are 9 rows, numbered from 1 to 9 in the stadium, each having several seats. Each row as well as each guest has some priority.
Note:

Guest 1 is to be prioritized more than guest 2. Similarly guest 2 is to be more prioritized than guest 3 and so on.
Row 1 is superior to row2. Similarly row 2 is superior to row 3 and so on.


Arrangement Criteria:


All the guests should get a seat of their choice.
Each guest has a set of preferred rows in which they want a seat.



So now your work comes into play. :P
You need to arrange them in different rows of their choice. No, its not that easy...you also need to prioritize. :)
You need to find an arrangement in which guest 1 gets the seat in the best row possible out of his choice satisfying the arrangement criteria. Then you need to assign best seat to guest 2 and so on. So your task is to generate an arrangement prioritizing guests from 1 to N in a way such that it always complies with the arrangement criteria.

Input

First line consists of a number N. 
Next line will have 9 space separated integers, A1 to A9, denoting empty seats in each of the 9 rows respectively.
This is followed by N lines, each of the form K followed by K space separated integers B1 to BK  denoting the seat preference of each guest from 1 to N.


Output

Print the N integers denoting the row number for each guest. If no arrangement is possible, print "It seems MSG" without quotes.


Constraints
1 ≤  N  ≤ 100 
1  ≤ K  ≤ 9 
0  ≤ Ai  ≤ 9 
1  ≤ Bi   ≤ 9 

Example
Input
5
1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0
5 1 2 3 4 5
1 1
5 1 2 3 4 5
5 1 2 3 4 5
5 1 2 3 4 5

Output
2 1 3 4 5


Explanation

Guest 1 should be allotted row 1 but as guest 2 has only row 1 as preference so we will not be able to arrange them. So guest 2 will be allotted row 1. Then Guest 1 will be allotted Row 2 followed by row 3 to guest 3, row 4 to guest 4 and row 5 to guest 5 as guest 3 has high priority than Guest 4 and Guest 5.
