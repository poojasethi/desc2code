 
In a mystical land where people don't understand how clocks work, the chef has managed to teach them how to see time with the help of angles, write a code which will tell the angle between the two clock hands at any time.
 

Input
The line 1 of the input should contain the integer H representing 'hours' of the clock.
The line two of the input should contain the integer M representing 'minutes'of the clock.

Output
The output should contain the angle between the hours hand and the minutes hand of the clock.
Tips:In 12 hours, the hour hand completes a full circle, a minute hand does the same in 60 minutes.

Constraints

0 ≤ H ≤ 12
0 ≤ M ≤ 60

 

Example
Input:545

Output:97.5
