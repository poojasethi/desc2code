 
Given a string, your task is to encrypt it. The encryption should be done using the following algorithm:

First, Swap the two halves of the given string.

If the string is of odd length, the character in the middle remains at its position.
For example, the string "abcde" is converted to "decab", and the string "abcd" is converted to "cdab".

Then, for each character x of the resultant string, perform the following operations

Find the positional value of the character x. Let the positional value of x be p.  The positional value is the position in which the character appears in the English alphabetical sequence. For example, the positional value of "a" is 1, "b" is 2, "c" is 3 and so on.
c. The character x is to be replaced by (p%10).f((p/10)+1), where "." has been used as a concatenation operator and function f(n) returns the nth position alphabet.


You may assume that the characters in the given string would only include lower case English alphabets.
 

Input
The first line of input would consist of T, the number of test cases. T lines follow each consisting of a string that is to be encrypted.
 

Output
For each test case output the corresponding encrypted text.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
