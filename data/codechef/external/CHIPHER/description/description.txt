Problem description.

time given to them. The faculty has thus decided to encode the
questions, which the students will then have to decode. They have
decided to enlist your help in this - don’t get too happy, you won’t be
told the questions which will be coming in your exam. Given the
question and an integer N, you are supposed to find the encoded
question, such that each letter of the alphabet in the question will be
offset by that integer N. For example if the integer is 2, a will
become c. If the offset goes beyond z, start again from a, so y will
become a. You have to preserve the case of each letter, and leave
all other characters unchanged. 


Input
The first line of input contains an integer T, the number of test
cases. The first line of each test case will consist of an integer N,
the offset integer. The next line will have the question string,
consisting of English alphabets, the question mark character ‘?’,
and the comma character ‘,’ and the space character.

Output
For each test case, output the encoded question on a line by itself.


Constraints

1 <= T <= 100
1 <= length of questing string <= 10^5
1 <= N <= 10^6



Example
