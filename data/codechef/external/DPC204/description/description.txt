        Fibonacci


         


        Recall the definition of the Fibonacci numbers:


         


        f1


        f2


        fnn-1+fn-2        (n>=3)


         


        Given two numbers a and b, calculate how many Fibonacci numbers are in the range 
        [a,b].


         


Input:


        The input contains several test cases. Each test case consists of two 
        non-negative integer numbers a and b. Input is terminated by a=b=0. Otherwise, 
        a<=b<=10^100. The numbers a and b are given with no superfluous 
        leading zeros.


         


Output:


        For each test case output on a single line the number of Fibonacci numbers fi 
        with a<=fi<=b.
