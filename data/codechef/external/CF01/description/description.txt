Aliens are planning to attack on Earth. Scientists at ISRO got a breakthrough when they were able to intercept the message being transferred in between aliens, but the problem is that aliens are using a technique for encrypting the message. Codefest team of IT-BHU were able to hack into the systems of aliens and decipher the method, the aliens were using for encryption but a method for decryption has not been found yet. You are required to decrypt the message.
The method used for encryption is explained below:
Consider a string of N alphabets for example encrypt (N=7). The string is treated as if the last character wraps around back to the first. Next consider a set S of N different strings, in which each string is formed by cyclic rotation of the alphabets of the original string. So for the string encrypt, S = {encrypt, ncrypte, crypten, ryptenc, yptencr, ptencry, tencryp}
The next step is to perform a lexicographical sort in decreasing order on the set of above strings. So S becomes {yptencr, tencryp, ryptenc, ptencry, ncrypte, encrypt, crypten}
Now, the encyrpted string of N alphabets is formed taking the last character from the above sorted strings. For given example, the encrypted string is rpcyetn. They also send the position of the first character of the encrypted string so that the message can be decrypted i.e. 5 for the given example. 

Input
There is a single integer T<=200 on the first line of input which denotes the number of test cases to follow. Each of the next T lines, contains a string made up of k alphabets (a-z characters only) followed by an integer N, separated by a blankspace. 1<=N<=k<=3000.

Output
Output consists of T lines, each containing the decrypted string.

Example

Input:
3
rpcyetn 5
rathe 5
aabb 2
Output:
encrypt
earth
abab
