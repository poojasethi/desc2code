 
There is a fest arranged in Banasthali University by Wappers. Yasha has come to the arranged stalls to eat. There are numbers assigned to each stall. Yasha visits only the magical stalls.
Description of Magical stalls: Calculate the sum of squares of each digit of stall number. Continue the process while checking if this sum is 1 at any iteration, then it is a magical stall. If the sum never turns up as 1 , it is unmagical stall.

 

INPUT
The first line contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
In each test case, first line have an integer M, denoting number of Stalls.
Second line have space separated M integers such that each integer denotes the stall number.

 

Output
For each test case output "YES" if the number is magical and "NO" if it is not in different lines.

Constraints
1<=T<=1800

1<=M<=50

 

Example
Input:

1
3
1 2 7


Output:

YES
NO
YES

 

Explanation
Example case 1. 
1 is a magical number as 12=1.
 2 is not a magical number as 22 =4.
7 is a magical number as 72=49  , so 42+92 =97 , so 92+72 =130  , so 12+32+02 =10 , so 12+02 =1.
