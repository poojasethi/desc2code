Points:10International cyber terrorists have launched a Firesail against the 

country. Its a three step attack on the nation to put it in an irrecoverable state of chaos. First the 

transportation system is taken out, followed by the financial base and the telecom. Finally all basic 

utilities such as water, power, nuclear sources and everything else controlled by computers is 

incapacitated leaving the nation in a deadlock. While the rest of the Force including Mr. Krypto is 

working to regain control and bring order to the chaos in the nation, you have been asked to locate 

and disable the operating centre of the terrorists. The good news is that you have homed in on their 

signal, but the bad news is that every time you enter a command to infiltrate their network, the query 

returns you a number instead. Seems like they have setup a very strong wall of defence. But time is 

running out and you must get past this firewall and break into their systems to shut them down. You 

must find how this algorithm works in order to overcome it. Can you figure out how to get past their 

defences and disable them in this ultimate race against time?
