LUCKY ARMY 
A General is planning to attack one of its neighbouring country. The country
that he is going to attack is undefeated till date. So he went to his priest and
asked for his help. The priest told him that the only chance he can win the battle 
is by creating an army that only contain the soldiers having id numbers which are multiple
of 7 as 7 is the lucky number for General and his army. As this priest is widely known for his 
wisdom General chooses to act upon his advice. He calls his army to the ground and 
ask Chef to calculate the total number soldiers that can be selected for the battle. Chef wants
you to help him with this.
Input Format: 
First line contains an integer T, representing number of test cases.
For each of test cases:
First line contains an integer N, representing the number of soldiers present on the ground.
Second line contains N integers that are space separated representing the id number of each soldier.

Output Format: 
For every test case output will be an integer giving the total number of soldiers that can go for battle.
Constraints: 
1 <= T <= 50 
1 <= N <= 1000

Examples: 
Input
3
4
12 43 7 2
6
3 21 19 49 18 28
5
10 23 64 53 87

Output
1
3
0
Explanation:
First line gives T=3 (3 test cases). 4 in next line means there will be 4 soldiers on the
ground and the next line gives id numbers of all 4 soldiers . Output for this test case is 1
as there is only one number that is multiple of 7(7 itself). Similarly, 3 for the second test case
as there are 3 numbers that are multiple of 7(21 49 28) and in the same way 0 for third test case.
