Ram has created a special type of virus which can block the sim number. To start the sim again victim needs to find the deactivation code of virus using their sim number only. The technique to find the deactivation code is that multiply first 5 digits of sim number with the digit which is five places away from the multiplier and add them.
For Example. 9412356780 is the number which is blocked by virus. So its deactivation code will be calculated as 9*5+4*6+1*7+2*8+3*0= 92.
