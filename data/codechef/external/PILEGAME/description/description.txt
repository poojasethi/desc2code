Sam and Zuck are playing a game. In this game there are k piles, numbered from 1 to n. Each pile, for i from 1 to n, has ni number of stones. In his turn, a player can select any odd number of piles having at least one stone, and remove one stone each from all these piles. Since Zuck already is the owner of a multi-billion dollar company, he allows Sam to take the first turn in this game. The player who cannot make a move loses.
Given the original configuration, your aim is to determine who wins the game, provided both players play optimally.

Input:
The first line contains a single integer T, the number of Test cases.
Each test case has an integer K.
This is followed by K integers n1, n2 ....nk. 
T<=100 
Sum of K for all test cases <= 10^6 
ni < 10^8.

Output
For every test case print exactly one line, either "Sam" or "Zuck" (without the quotes)

Example
Input:
1
3
1 2 3

Output:
Zuck

Note:  Large test files. Use faster I/O.
