 
In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer N, denoted by N!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to N. The factorial operation is encountered in many areas of mathematics, notably in combinatorics, algebra, and mathematical analysis. Its most basic occurrence is the fact that there are N! ways to arrange N distinct objects into a sequence (i.e., permutations of the set of objects). Today, Ross is working on a complicated combinatorial problem and he needs to find out factorials of some small integers. Help him!!
