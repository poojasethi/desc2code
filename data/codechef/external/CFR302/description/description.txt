Stack is a special data structure which follows the property of last in first out. Stack is used to solve the postfix expressions.
Your job is to find out number of push operations in stack which are required to solve a postfix expression equivalent to given infix expression. 

Input
First line of input contains the number of test cases (T not more than 10). First line of each test case consists infix expression(length of the expression is not more than 20)


Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the number of push operations

Example

Input:
3
x+y+x*z/n+n
m*h+h-s+9
b+n+m*2+v/6
Output:
11
9
11
