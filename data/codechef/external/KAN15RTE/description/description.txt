Da Vinci is about to retire from the post of Prime Minister of the French King in a month. It
is going to be very difficult for the King to find his replacement. The King is worried about the
junior ministers as to how they will work without a leader.
To instill in some values of team work among them, the King has asked all the N junior
ministers to paint M walls together. The King feels that such a hands-on activity is a very
good way to make the junior ministers come together and work as a team. The ministers are
allowed to divide a wall into parts such that each part is painted by a different minister. No
two ministers are allowed to paint the same wall at the same time.
It can be assumed that all the ministers paint the wall at the same rate. As this is just a
training exercise, ministers may have other important jobs as well and they may not be free all
the time to do the painting work. S is the start time and E is the end time between which a
minister is free to paint the walls. Also, we know that for a minister, painting is a mundane
job. It may happen that a minister gets bored while painting a wall, leaves it in between and
starts painting another wall without wasting any time. The minister may later come back to
finish the previous wall or he may ask one of the other ministers who he is friends with to finish
painting the wall.
The King is really worried about the future of the kingdom which is going to have these min-
isters without a leader. He really wants these ministers to make smart decisions and perform
well in any situation that they may face. Thus, he has decided to put some extra constraints
on the wall painting exercise. The King knows the number of man hours H required for a wall
to get painted completely. So, for each wall he has decided a duration with the start time A
and the end time D during which the ministers should start and finish painting the wall.
As anxious the King is about testing his ministers, he is also worried that a failure in com-
pleting the task may harm their confidence. He wants to know whether his junior ministers
would be able to finish the given task and meet the deadlines or not. You need to help the King
to find this out.
 

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T which is the number of test cases to follow.
The first line of each test case consists of two space separated integers N and M . Each of the
next N lines contains two space separated integers S and E. Next M lines contain three space
separated integers A, D and H each.
 

Output
For each test case, output a separate line containing “YES” (quotes for clarity) if it is possible
for the junior ministers to paint each of the walls during the designated time. Output “NO”
(quotes for clarity) if it is not possible to do so.
 

Constraints
Should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have. Format it like:

1 ≤ T ≤ 510
1 ≤ N,M ≤ 100
0 ≤ S,E,A,D,H ≤ 10^7

 

Example
Input:
1
2 2
1 5
3 4
1 5 3
2 4 2

Output:
YES
 

Explanation
The first minister paints the first wall from time 1 − 2. Then he paints the second wall from time 2 − 3. Then he paints the first wall again from time 3 − 5. The second minister paints the second wall from time 3 − 4. Thus both the walls get painted fully.
