A forward shifted alphabet code is a form of coding in which each letter has been shifted for a particular number. For example, if a message has been encrypted by shifting 2, then 'C' will be written in place of 'A' , 'B' in place of 'Z', 'A' in place of 'Y' and so on. Such integers are the keys to decode shifted alphabet codes.
Thaton likes sending encoded messages(only alphabets) to Pravakar. So to decode those messages she gave him N alarm clocks, all set at 12 O' clock with batteries removed, placed sequentially in a box. The alarm clocks rings every  { x1,x2,x3,x4,..........,xn }  hours respectively. While sending the message, she tells Pravakar not to consider a continuous sequence of alarm clocks in the set from positions L to R i.e from XL to XR is not under consideration and ask him to insert the batteries in the rest of the alarm clocks (except alarm clocks from L to R) and informs him that the minimum number of hours after which all the clocks under consideration ring simultaneously is the key to her message. Help Pravakar!!
Note :  Shifting of character occurs in a circular manner, i.e. if 'y' need to be shifted forward by 2,
	Then y+2='a' i.e in forward shifting, after z we starts with 'a' again, and in backward shifting , after 'a' we again starts with 'z' e.g back shift 'c' by 5 will be : 'x'.


Input


1st Line contains a single integer N denoting numbers of alarm clocks.
2nd line contains N space separated integers { x1,x2,x3,x4,..........,xn } as described in the statement.
3rd line contains a single integer Q denoting the number of Queries.
1st line for each query contains two space separated integers L and R.
2nd line for each query contains the encoded message.


Output
For each Query, print the decoded message in a line.

Constraints

1 <=N,Xi,L,R <=20
1 <=Q <=200
1 <= Length of Encoded Message<=256

Explanation
One of the clock rings every hour while the other rings every 2 hours and since the value of L =3 and R=3, So third clock is not under consideration. So, the 1st and 2nd clock will ring together after two hours. In other words, all the letters in the given string has been shifted forward by 2. So to decode the message, we have to shift each character backward by 2
