In mathematics, the absolute value (or modulus) |a| of a real number a is the numerical value of a without regard to its sign. So, for example, the absolute value of 3 is 3, and the absolute value of -3 is also 3. The absolute value of a number may be thought of as its distance from zero.


Input

There is a single positive integer T on the first line of input. It stands for the number of numbers to follow. Then there are T lines, each containing exactly one integer number N ,  -10000 ≤ N ≤ 10000


Output

For every input number N, output a single line containing the absolute value of N.


Example

Input:
4
-9
-4
6
-1
Output:
9
4
6
1
