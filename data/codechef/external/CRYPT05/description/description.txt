Problem Statement 
A Mathematics professor walked into her class. She wanted to test her students’ abilities and hence, gave them a series:
1,1,2,3,5,8….
And asked them to predict the number at a given position.
Write a program to do exactly that. Your task is to take numbers as input (one per line), and print the corresponding number in the inputted position.
Note:  0 Terminates the program.


Constraints
No generated number in excess of 1000 digits will be in the test data, i.e.
Func(25) = 75025 has 5 digits.

Example
Input:
5
99
0


Output:
5
218922995834555169026
