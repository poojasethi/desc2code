Problem Description
Alice and Bob are back. This time they are playing a very strange game. There is a stack consisting of even number of balls open at both the ends. Each ball has a number written on it.
The balls can be taken out only from the ends. Alice and bob plays turn by turn. Alice plays strategicallyy but Bob always takes out the ball which has maximum points.Alice always plays first
Your task is to find which player has scored maximum points and wins the game when all the balls are taken out. In each turn a player can take out only one ball form either of the ends.
you will be given an sequence of integers a[1], a[2],...,a[n] where a[i] represents the points of the ith ball.
 

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each test case T consists of two lines:
First line: Number of elements 'N'. 'N' is always even. 
Second Line: 'N' space separated Integers.


Output
For each test case output contains two space separated Integers:
First : The winner ('1' for Alice, and '2' for 'Bob'),
Second: Difference between the points of the players.
 

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ N ≤ 1000
1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 1000
