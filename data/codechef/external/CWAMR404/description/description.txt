 
A network of towers is present in a city for effective communication. A tower 'X' can send data to tower 'Y' , if 'X' has a directed connection to 'Y' , while 'Y' can send data to 'X' , if 'Y' has a directed connection to 'X'. So given such a network with N number of towers & M number of directed connection , find all the possible intermediate towers used to send the data between given tower 'A' and 'B'. And also given a tower 'Z' , check if the tower is essential for the communication to exist between towers 'A' and 'B', if a path exists between the give towers. If essential , print "YES" and if not essential print "NO". If there is no way of connection between the given towers , Print "NO WAY" and don't check for the essential tower condition.
Note: Tower  value ranges from 0 to N-1.

 

Input
First line contains the number of test cases T.
For each test case:
Following line contains the number of towers N.
Following line contains the value of tower 'A', tower 'B' and tower 'Z'.
Following line contains the number of directed connection M.
Following M lines , denote the directed connection between  tower 'T1' and tower 'T2'.


Output
For each test case, output the required answer.

NO


 

Explanation:
first 4 lines of the output , gives all possible way of communication ,
i.e:eg:  4->2->3 . And tower '7' is not essential for communication as towers 4->2->3 connection can be established which does not need tower '7'
