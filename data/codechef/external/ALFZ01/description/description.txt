Romeo wants to get some roses for Juliet and so he goes into a garden. The garden is in the shape of a H x W rectangle, where there are H rows and W columns. Each unit square of the garden has 1 to 100 flowers in it. Romeo has to grab as many flowers as possible, subject to the following restrictions:
He starts by choosing any square in the first row, and collects the flowers on that square. Then, he moves to a square in the next row, collects the flowers, and so on until he reaches the last row. He can not go back to a previous row
When he moves to the next row, he can only move to the square just below it or diagonally to the left or right.
Help Romeo grab the maximum number of roses he can. 

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follow:
The first line of each test case contains two integers H and W denoting the number of rows and columns respectively.
H lines follow. Each line has W space separated integers A1, A2, ..., AW, where each integer M is the number of flowers in that square.

Output
Output T lines, one for each test case. Each line should contain a single integer, which is the maximum possible number of flowers Romeo can get, for the corresponding test case. 

Constraints

1 <= T <= 100
1 <= H, W, M <= 100


Example
Input:
1
11 2
18 66 
19 97 
43 94 
85 27 
23 73 
17 34 
97 52 
74 35 
64 50 
15 59 
44 44

Output:
787


Explanation
Example case 1. The best solution will be to select 66 + 97 + 94 + 85 + 73 + 34 + 97 + 74 + 64 + 59 + 44 = 787
