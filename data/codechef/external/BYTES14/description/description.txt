Today Rohan lost his way back to home in the woods . He wants to go back to his home . He is n distance away from his home . He can reach his way back by jumping through the woods .
He can make either a 2 distance jump or a 3 distance jump . He will make a 2 distance jump with probability p , else he will make a 3 distance jump . What is the expected time for Rohan to reach his home , if each jump takes 2 sec time .
PS. He can also cover distance greater than n through his jumps i.e., if he covers distance greater than n or equal to n , in both the cases it is considered as he has reached his home .
 

Input

First line of input is the number of test cases t  .  For each test case ,next line contains 2 integers n  and p . 

Output
