Ram brought home N identical crackers, and arranged them in a row. He then numbered all the crackers with positive integer numbers such that product of any two numbers is less than or equal to K. He also ensured that the numbers read from left most cracker to right most cracker are in non-decreasing order.
Ravana took away all the crackers when Ram was not at home. To keep things simple, Cool dude Laxman brought N new identical crackers. Now he want to number them following the conditions Ram followed, but he realized that there are multiple ways to do it.
Given N and K, write a program to output the number of ways to number the crackers. If there are infinite ways to do it, output "-1" instead.

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
Only line of each testcase contains two integer numbers N and K.

Output
For each test case output one line. If the number of ways is infinite print "-1". If the number of ways is finite, print the required answer modulo 1000000007.

Constraints

1 ≤ T, N, K ≤ 100000


Example
Input:
2
2 1
2 2
Output:
1
2

Explanation
Test case #1:
We need to number 2 crackers. And the product of any two numbers should not exceed 1. The only possible numbering is "1 1"

Test case #2:
In this case the product of any two numbers should not exceed 2. Two possible ways are "1 1" and "1 2".
Note that "2 1" is invalid because Ram ensured that the numbering from left to right is non-decreasing.
