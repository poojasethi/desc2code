The legendary Sherlock Holmes needs your help in solving a case. He has been trying to solve the case of The Lost Number for a long time and using his exceptional skills, has been able to discover all N parts of the number. He also knows that the Lost Number is the arrangement of these N parts, that results in the numerically maximum number.
Since he is very busy with other cases, he needs you to use your coding skills to  help him find The Lost Number. Given N numbers K1 K2 K3â€¦Kn, output the biggest number that can be formed by joining these N numbers.

Input
First line of the input contains the number of test cases T.
For each test case there are 2 lines of input-
The first line contains an integer N.
The second line contains N space separated numbers Ki.

Output
For each test case output a single line containing the maximum number that can be formed.

Constraints
1<=T<=20
1<=N<=100
1<=K [i]<=10^18

Example

Input:

4 1 8
2
231 942
2
59 542

Output:
