 
Lucky has an array of N elements. The array consists of [1, 2, ……., N] (1 and N are inclusive). She decided to find the value by Xoring the contiguous sub arrays, follow by Xoring the values in the sub array. So help her to obtain the results.

 

Input
Input description.
Tips:

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
Next T lines contains an integer N.


 

Output

For each test case, print the required answer in a single line.

 

Constraints
Should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have. Format it like:

1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6

 

Example
Input:
1
5

Output:
7
 

Explanation
Example case:  Elements in the array are [1, 2, 3, 4, and 5].
The result is 1⊕2⊕3⊕4⊕5⊕(1⊕2) ⊕(2⊕3) ⊕(3⊕4) ⊕(4⊕5) ⊕(1⊕2⊕3) ⊕(2⊕3⊕4) ⊕(3⊕4⊕5) ⊕(1⊕2⊕3⊕4) ⊕(2⊕3⊕4⊕5) ⊕(1⊕2⊕3⊕4⊕5) = 7
