In the University College of Engineering, an event called Code is being hosted. To participate in that event there is a preliminary round to be qualified. In this round, students are needed to find the angle between the Hour hand and Minute hand in a 12hr Clock at a particular instance of time(HH:MM), the best performing algorithm wins the place in the Code event. So help the Students in writing the program.

Input
First line contains T (number of test cases)
Next T lines contain HH, MM


Output
T lines producing the required answer rounded upto 1 decimal.

Constraints

00<=HH<=23
00<=MM<=59
1<=T<=1000


Example
Input:
3
12 00 
20 00
