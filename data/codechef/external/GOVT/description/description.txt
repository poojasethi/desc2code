Secret Project
1,X2.........XN amount in millions such that  X1,X2.........XN are all distinct i.e the amount they are ready to invest are different and the amount is not in fraction (i.e example X111 and X2  amount individually) when grouped together,they feel confident and wish to invest more such that their total invested amount is equal to the sum of product of their individual investments added to their individual amount to be invested(i.e individually they could invest X1 and X2 amounts but after grouping together they can invest a total amount of   X1+X2+X1*X2).Investors can further be combined with other investors and groups but by using the grouping policy mentioned before.
The Target is to find the maximum amount of money the government can fetch from the n investors.

INPUT
The first line contain an integer T denoting the number of test cases.The T cases are follow.The first line of each test case contain one integer N,M denoting the number of investor and integer respectively.The second line contains N space separted integer denoting the amount invested by X1,X2.......XN
investors respectively.

OUTPUT
For each test case output a single line consisting a single integer denoting the modulo M of maximum amount of money the government can fetch from the investors.

CONSTRAINTS

1<=T<=10^3
1<=N<=10^3
1<=M<=10^6
1<=X1,X2.........XN<=N 


SUBTASK

subtask#1: N<=10,M<=10^3(10 points)
subtask#2: N,M<=10^3(30 points)
subtask#3: original constraints(60 points)


SAMPLE
INPUT:
1
4 10
2 3 1 4
OUTPUT:
9
EXPLAINATION:
In first test case the maximum amount of money govt. can fetch is 119 Million. So, 119%10=9 is the answer.
