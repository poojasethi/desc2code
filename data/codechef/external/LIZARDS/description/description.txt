Lizards are weird creatures. Not only are they afraid of bigger animals, they even get afraid when they see some other lizard staring at them.
 N lizards are standing in a line, each of them is either facing left or right. A pair of indices (i,j) (i < j) is called an afraid pair if lizard at index i is facing right, and lizard at index j is facing left. 
 Q queries are given, each query represented by two integers l and r (0 ≤ l ≤ r < N). Query l r means flip direction of the lizards which have indices between l and r, inclusive. E.g., if the arrangement was LRRL then after query 1 3 it becomes LLLR. 
 After each query, print the number of afraid pairs in the arrangement.

Input Description
First line contains single integer NNext line contains N characters, each being either L or R. L means lizard facing left, R means facing rightNext line has a single integer Q, the number of queriesNext Q lines each has 2 space separated integers l and r

Output Description
For each query print the number of afraid pairs in the arrangement of lizards.
