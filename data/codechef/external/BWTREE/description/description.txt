Given a tree of size N with each vertex colored either black or white. Find the number of paths with alternating colors.

Input
First line will have N, the number of vertices of the tree and then N-1 lines will follow of the form u v which denotes an edge between the vertex u and v. Finally, the next line will contain the space separated color(either W for white or B for Black) of each vertex.

Output
Single number denoting the number of paths with alternating colors modulo 10^9 + 7 (1000000007).

Constraints
 N <= 10^5 
 

Example
Input:
3
1 2
1 3
W B B

Output:
6
 

Explanation
These are the alternating colored paths [1],[2],[3],[1,2],[1,3],[2,1,3]
