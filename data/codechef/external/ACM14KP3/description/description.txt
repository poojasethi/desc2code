Two strings a[0..n-1] and b[0..n-1] are called cyclic equivalent if and only if there exists an offset d, such that for all 0 <= i < n, a[i] = b[(i + d) mod n].
Given two strings s[0..L-1] and t[0..L-1] with same length L. You need to find the maximum p such that s[0..p-1] and t[0..p-1] are cyclic equivalent.Print 0 if no such valid p exists.

Input
The first line contains an integer T indicating the number of test cases.
For each test case, there are two lines in total. The first line contains s. The second line contains t.
All strings contain only lower case alphabets.

Output
Output T lines in total. Each line should start with "Case #: " and followed by the maximum p. Here "#" is the number of the test case starting from 1.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ L ≤ 1000000


Example
Input:
2
abab
baba
abab
baac

Output:
Case 1: 4
Case 2: 3


Explanation
Case 1, d can be 1.
Case 2, d can be 2.
