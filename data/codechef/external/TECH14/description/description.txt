How many permutations of the first N numbers exist such that the maximum element between the indices [i..j] is either present at index i, or at index j ?

Input
The first line contains the number of test cases T ( ≤ 10000). Each of the next T lines contains an integer N ( ≤ 1000000000)


Output
Output T lines containing the required answer for the corresponding test case. Since the answers can get really big, output the result modulo 1000000007.

Example

Input:
1
2

Output:
2
