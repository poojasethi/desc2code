There are N numbered boxes placed on a table, let Bi denote the ith box in the line. Write a program that finds the total number of ways to place N identical balls such that atmost k balls are present in the boxes B1, .... ,Bk for 1 ≤ k ≤ n. Since the number can be quite large you are supposed to output the answer modulo 761238923.


Input
Input will contain multiple testcases, on each line N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100) will be given. The last line contains 0 which should not be processed.


Output
For each testcase output exactly one line, the total number possible of ways modulo 761238923.


Example

Input:
1
2
0


Output:
1
2
