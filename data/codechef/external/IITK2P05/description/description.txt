This problem is simple. You will be given an integer  N  and you need to factorize that number. To help you with factorization of  N , you will also be given  phi(N) . 

 phi(x)  is also known as Euler's Totient  function.
 phi(x)  is defined as number of positive integers less than or equal to x which are relatively prime to  x  (i.e, greatest common divisor is 1).


Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two space separated integers representing N and  phi(N)  respectively. N  denotes the number to be factorized.


Output

For each test case, output a single line containing the prime factors of  N  in non decreasing order. See example for clarity.


Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 20
2 ≤ N ≤ 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 (10^18)
