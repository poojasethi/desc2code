An alien from a galaxy far far away has come to Earth to check out the best commodity on Earth - chocolate. The alien, on 29th January, 2013 has N chocolates.
On each day, if the number of chocolates is even, he will eat half of the chocolates. If it is odd, he brings more chocolates such that the new number of chocolates is thrice the current number of chocolates plus three.
