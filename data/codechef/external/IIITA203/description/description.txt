BANKOO'S PROBLEM

PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Bankoo is a serial bunker and always trys to bunk classes whenever possible. But as luck would have it, his college announced a new rule that a minimum percentage of attendance in each subject is necessary to write the semester examination. Thus, Bankoo wants to compute the maximum number of classes he can bunk so that he can still appear for the exams. But having bunked all the maths and programming classes in the previous semesters, he doesn't know much of programming and is unable to do the task. So, Bankoo seeks your help. Can you help him?
You are given N subjects. For each of the subject, you are the given the number of classes and the minimum percentage of attendance required to write the semester examination for that particular subject. You are supposed to find the maximum number of the classes he can bunk for each of the subject.
