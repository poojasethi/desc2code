Ravit and his friends are die hard fans of cricket. As india has reached the semifinal of ICC world cup 2015 they want to support India. So Ravit goes to the sports shop of the nearby market to buy some T-Shirts for his friends.
When he gets to the cash counter, he puts all his T T-shirts on the counter and while waiting in the queue, he realizes that the
sports shop recently started to round the total price of a purchase to the nearest multiple of
10 rupees (with 5 rupees being rounded upwards).
For example, 73 rupees are rounded to 70 rupees,
while 85 are rounded to 90.
It is possible to divide his purchase into groups and to pay for each group separately. He managed
to find  Z dividers to divide his purchase in up to z + 1 groups. He wondered where to place the
dividers to minimize the total cost of his purchase.He doesn't want to
rearrange the items on the belt because he is in a hurry.
