Mike is a naughty child. He never takes his classes seriously. He usually plays mathematical games in his boring lectures. This time he started writing an infinite GP of positive numbers with a common ratio of 2.

1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128.....
He named this series as M-series and made a game. The rules of the game are as follows:

You will be given an array of N numbers (0 based indexing) and will be asked following queries:
(i)Give the count of numbers from array indices x to y (both inclusive) which are present in M-series. This query will be of the form 1 x y.

(ii)Change the value of array from indices x to y(both inclusive) to some another number z. This query will be of the form 0 x y z.

As his lecture is about to finish. You are asked to write a program for his game.


Input
First line of the input will consist of two integers N and Q which denotes array size and number of queries.
Then N integers will follow giving the array elements and then Q queries will be asked as described above.


Output
Output the answer corresponding to the queries.

Constraints
1<=N<=100000
      1<=Q<=100000
      1<=array element<=1000000000000000000


Example
Input:
5 3
1 9 13 4 11
1 0 3
0 1 3 7
1 0 3
Output:
2
1

Note:
Use fast input/output methods.
