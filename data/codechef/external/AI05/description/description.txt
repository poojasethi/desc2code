Tom was running behind jerry and he was about to catch Jerry, suddenly Jerry entered a tunnel, 
which follows a specefic pattern, if we take initial point of tunnel as (0,0) on a plane and write all non-integer 0,1,2..... we get a staircase pattern as shown in the figure. For ex. we locate 1,2 ,3 points as (1,1),(2,0) and (3,1) respectively and follow this pattern continuously

So to help Tom  find Jerry's location, you have to write a program that reads the coordinates of a point (x,y) and write the number (if any) that has been written at that point (x,y) coordinate if input is range 0...5000.

Input
The first line of the input is N, the number of test cases for this problem. In each of the N following lines, there is x, and y representing the coordinates (x,y) of a point.

Output: 
For each point in the input, write the number at that point or write No Number if there is none.

Example

Input:
3 
4 2 
6 6
3 4
Output:
6 
12
No Number
