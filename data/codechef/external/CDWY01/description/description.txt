Ram & Shyam have recently studied about palindromes and are challenging each other with various palindromic problems. Ram recently came up with a problem of his own, He gave Shyam a string and told him to find out the difference of the largest palindrome sub-string of that string and the smallest palindrome sub-string of the given string.
Given a string, S, Shyam ask for your help to complete the challenge or he'll lose.
