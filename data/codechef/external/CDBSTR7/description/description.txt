Huge population has been a major problem in India. To reduce the population growth, Pratyush was asked to come up with a plan.
Pratyush, being an intelligent as he is, came up with the following plan: A man with name M is allowed to marry a woman with name W, only if M is anagram of W or W is anagram of M.
One name is an anagram of another if the second is simply a rearrangement of the first. For example, 'heart' and 'earth' are anagrams.
Your task is to determine whether a couple is allowed to marry or not, according to Pratyush's rule.
