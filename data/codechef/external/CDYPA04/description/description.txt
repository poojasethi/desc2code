Raju loves to play logical games,One fine day his friend Gopi came to his home and told him about a game known as game of dots which his professor asked him in his maths class.As Gopi knew that raju is very passionate about solving logical problems so he decided to play the game with him.Gopi started telling the rules of the game to raju which goes like this-
The game is played on a square field consisting of n × n cells. Initially all cells are empty. On each turn a player chooses and put a dot in an empty cell that has no common sides with previously dotted cells. Adjacent corner of dotted cells is allowed. On the next turn another player does the same, then the first one and so on. The player with no cells to put a dot on his turn loses the game.
Gopi have chosen the field size n and allowed Raju to choose to be the first or the second player in the game. What should you choose for Raju to let him win the game? Both players play optimally.
