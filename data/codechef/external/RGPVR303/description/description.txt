Your are given sticks of different length and your task is to find the number of different triangle that can be formed from these sticks. Two triangles are considered to be similar if each of their corresponding sides is equal in length. If it is not possible to create any triangle then you should output 0.
Note :The triangle inequality theorem states that any side of a triangle is always shorter than the sum of the other two sides


Input
Input will begin with an integer T, the number of test cases.Each Test case starts with an Integer N, the number of sticks followed by N lines ,each consist of length of stick(L). 
 1 ≤ T ≤ 25 , 1 ≤ N ≤ 20 and 1 ≤ L ≤ 10000


Output
For each set of sticks, output a single line consist of the no. of different triangles to be formed.
