 
Problem description.
 
Ram and Shyam were competing against each other and asked each other competitve problems . It is Shyam's turn and his problem is as follows :

1 .     A string is given . Let " w " be the longest substring of length l of the   given string such that it is also its prefix . 
2.     Now he was asked whether its possible to remove some prefix ( meaning some characters from the starting )of the given string so that the remaining string has
" w " string as a substring ( not necessarily the longest of the remaining string ) and also as its prefix !!

If its possible to do so , also find the minimum characters to be removed .
Help Ram solve this problem !!
( Remember if " w " is NULL print " NO ")


Input
There would be only one line consisting of the string

Output
" YES " or " NO " according to the condition described above

If " YES " then also print the number of minimum characters to be removed from the input string .

Constraints
 1 <=len(string)<=1000000 

Example
Input:
abcabcdabc

Output:
YES
3


Explanation
The longest substring of the input is " abc " which is also the prefix .
Now we can remove the prefix " abc " where the remaining string would become " abcdabc ". 
We can easily see that for the remaining string we have the 
substring " abc " which is the substring as well as the prefix of the remaining string "abcdabc" .
