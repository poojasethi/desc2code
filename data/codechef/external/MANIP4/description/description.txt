Okay, now we're talking class 6 geometry. Remember that, don't you? Lines and points and aha! Triangles? We give you 3 points and you tell us what sort of a triangle it forms, if it forms a triangle that is. What? Yes! That's all!


 Input 

The first line of input gives the number of cases, N. N test cases follow. Each case is a line formatted as:
x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3


 Output 

For each test case, output one line containing "Case #x: " followed by one of these strings (minus the bullet): 
- not a triangle
- isosceles acute triangle
- isosceles obtuse triangle
- isosceles right triangle
- scalene acute triangle
- scalene obtuse triangle
- scalene right triangle


 Limits 
1 ≤ N ≤ 100,
x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3 will be integers.
-1000 ≤ x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3 ≤ 1000

Output
Case #1: isosceles obtuse triangle
Case #2: scalene acute triangle
Case #3: isosceles acute triangle
Case #4: scalene right triangle
