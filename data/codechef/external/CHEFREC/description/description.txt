Chef is very fond of squares but he didn't like rectangles at all instead he fears from them. To make him comfortable with the rectangles his teacher gave him a simple task.
His teacher gave him a 2D matrix of N X M size ,
where n is number of rows and m is number of columns.
He has to print the elements of the matrix in Diagonal wise. 



For the matrix shown in image traversal is: 3 7 9 98 88 7 90 2 34 2 2 7
NOTE: Due to large Input Output file it is preferred to use fast input output methods.

Input:
The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting number of test cases.For each testcase:

First line contains two space separated integers N, M.
Next N lines contains M space seprated Integers.



Output
Output a single line containing N X M space separated numbers Diagonal wise of given Matrix.


Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ N, M ≤ 500
1 ≤ Elements of Matrix ≤ 10^9



Example
Input:
12 33 1 68 6 4

Output:
3 1 8 6 6 4
