Problem description.
Chef has 2 brothers David and Michael. All of them are very fond of numbers. David and Michael keep adding an initial number which is input by the user(a and b respectively) to the previous number,initially starting from 0. They ask the Chef to merge the numbers in array. They make the task of chef difficult by telling him not to put the number in the array more than once and put the numbers in the array in ascending order. After some time they ask the chef the i th number in the array where i is input by the user. 

Input
Input description.

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
Each test case contains 3 space-separated integers a denoting David's number,b denoting Michael's number and i denoting the i th number


Output
Output description.

For each test case, output a single line containing i th number in the merged array .


Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
1 ≤ a,b ≤ 3000
1 ≤ i ≤ 10^9


Example
Input:
3
3 5 7
13 11 20
2 4 6

Output:
15
121
12



Explanation
Example case 1. a=3  {3,6,9,12,15,18,21.... and so on}
b=5  {5,10,15,20,25.... and so on}
merged={3,5,6,9,10,12,15,18,21....and so on}
c=7
