Problem description.
Finally Lelouch has reached “Kyoto”. There he found many odd looking sticks under a tree. When he looked more closely, he found a message engraved on the tree saying-“You can perform magic with a GOOD stick!! A stick of length ‘L’ is GOOD if there exists a right angled triangle whose length all the sides are positive integers and the length of the HYPOTENUSE = L !! “ Lelouch being a greedy person collected  “T” sticks. Now he wonders whether he can perform magic with a specific stick whose length is a positive integer “L”.

Input
Input description.
First line of the test file contains the number of sticks collected by Michael -> TT lines follow. The i’th line specifies the length L of the i’th stick.

Output
Output T lines. On the ith line  print “YES” if he can perform magic with the i’th stick otherwise print “NO” (quotes only for clarity).

Constraints
T<=300L<=100000 (=10^5)

Example
Input:
3161718Output:
NOYESNO 

Explanation
Since 8^2 + 15^12 = 17^2, 17 is a valid integer hypotenuse, and hence it is accepted
