Chef and Mahi are good friends. Chef Likes to play with Numbers he is very good at maths. Chef has N distinct Numbers with him in sorted order. Chef always make fun of Mahi as he is a medical student, He doesn't know maths. Chef thinks of a game called "Game of Numbers". Here are rules of the Game. 
Take an integer A ≤ N. And Let,
SA be the number of ways in which first 'A' numbers from the set of Numbers can be arranged in any order. 
SA+1 be the number of ways in which first 'A+1' numbers from the set of Numbers can be arranged in any order.
.
.
.
SN be the number of ways in which first 'N' number from the set can be arranged in any order. 
Then find the sum of above Computations that is SA + SA+1 + SA+2 + ..... + SN.

Now chef explained the Game to Mahi and they Both started playing. Mahi needs your help in this game.

NOTE: Output Can be Very Large print it as ans mod 10^9+7. 

Input
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of single line and it contains values A and N respectively.

Output
For each test case, print a single line giving the answer to the problem.
