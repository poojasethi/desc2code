Problem description.

Birju(the hacker) is the teacher of hacking class and was supposed to take an extra lecture of 5th sem IT.   Birju had already taken 2 lectures that day so he was very tired. He could not give free lecture to students because they were very much talkative.So he decided to give the students a task. Each student had to ask a good programming question to the rest of the class and no question could be repeated. Birju decided to call the students roll number-wise.Now Anshul is the first roll number in the class and Jay is the 2nd Birju invited Anshul on stage to ask the question. Anshul asked the class to find the nth Fibonacci number, but Jay also had same question in his mind. So when birju called Jay to share his question, in a dilemma he quickly asked the class to find the nth non-fibonacci number.

But problem arised was Jay doesn't know how to find nth non-fibonacci number, so he has asked for your help to find nth non-fibonacci number. Write the program to help Tanna..

Input:

First line contains number t, total number of test cases.Then next t lines contain one number n for which you have to find nth non-fibonacci number.

output:

t lines containing nth non-fibonacci number for each test cases.

constraints:

0 < t <= 1000000
0 < n <= 100000000

sample test case:

5
1
2
3
4
5

sample output:

4
6
7
9
10
