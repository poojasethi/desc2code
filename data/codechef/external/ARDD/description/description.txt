Darshit enters his classroom to discover his Professor Shastri shouting at the top of his voice, and the entire class in commotion. He soon realizes what's wrong.  Someone broke a canister of Deodorant in the class, and Prof. Shastri will do anything to break his bones. 

Since no one knows who really did it, and it was probably done by someone from outside the class, the students decide to play a game. The loser of that game would have to own up to Prof. Shastri.
This wouldn't be a problem if Darshit wasn't on the defaulters list. But he was, and under no circumstances could own up to this messy situation. 
Help Darshit figure out exactly which person would be the loser in this game.


 The game 
All the students would sit on their seats, and their names would be written in a list. Then, one by one, names would be struck off the list. A number between 1 and 5 would be chosen, and the striking would proceed based on that number. The second last person to be struck off the list would have to own up to Prof. Shastri

This would've been easy if people still had to sit, but most of the class had already picked their seats!


Note
There will be total 5 sample inputs given to your program. All input values lie between 0 and 120.


Sample 
Assuming a class of 7 students
And a random number 3, striking would proceed as follows:
3,6,2,7,5,1,4 

Thus, the first person in the original list of names would be the loser.
