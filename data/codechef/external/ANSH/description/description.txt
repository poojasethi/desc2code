Problem description.
Ansh is very enthusiastic about his studies even at the age of 6 years. Recently he has studied about division and learnt to find quotient and remainder. After learning the division he became very happy and told Anshika about it. As Anshika is very smart, she decided to make fun of him. So she told him to solve a problem. The problem is as follows:-
For given two numbers N and M, calculate N mod 1 + N mod 2 + N mod 3 + ……..+ N mod M;
Here mod refers to the modulo operation. i.e. in A mod B we have to find the remainder after dividing A by B. Example: 5 mod 2 =1.
As the answer may be very large print it modulo 10^9 +7.
So save Ansh by helping him to find the answer as soon as possible.

Input
Only line containing two numbers N and M.

Output
Print a single integer corresponding to the given problem.

Constraints
1<=N, M<=10^13

Example
Input:
3 4

Output:
4


Input:
2 2

Output:
0
 

Explanation

Example 1: 3 mod 1=0
                 3 mod 2=1
                 3 mod 3=0
                 3 mod 4=3
 Therefore, the required answer= 0+1+0+3=4
