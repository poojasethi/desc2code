 
 Problem Statement:
Given an array, arr[] of size N followed by Q queries.
A query will include two values L and R. For each query, print the sum of the elements from L till R for the given array,
i.e Sum of arr[i] for each i such that L<=i<=R .

Input
First Line : T, denoting the number of test cases
Second line : N and Q
Third Line : N integers, ith integer denoting the value of arr[i]
Q lines follow : 
Each line has an L and R

 

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 100000
1 ≤ L ≤ R≤ N
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9

 

Example
Input: 
2
5 4
1 3 5 7 9
2 3
3 4
1 4
2 5
3 1
1 6 9
2 2

Output:

Explanation
Test Case 1: 
	Query 1 : 2 3 : Sum of 3 and 5 = 8
	Query 2 : 3 4 : Sum of 5 and 7 = 12
	Query 3 : 1 4 : Sum of 1, 3, 5 and 7 = 16
	Query 4 : 2 5 : Sum of 3, 5, 7 and 9 = 24
Test Case 2: 
	Query 1 : 2 2 : Sum of 6 = 6
