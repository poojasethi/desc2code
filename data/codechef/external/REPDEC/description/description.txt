In expansion of the fraction 2/33 is  , where the 0.6(bar)  is used to indicate that the cycle 06 repeats indefinitely with no intervening digits. In fact, the decimal expansion of every rational number (fraction) has a repeating cycle as opposed to decimal expansions of irrational numbers, which have no such repeating cycles.
Write a program that takes as input numerators and denominators of fractions and determines their repeating cycles. 

For this problem, define a repeating cycle of a fraction to be the first minimal length string of digits to the right of the decimal that repeats indefinitely with no intervening digits. Thus for example, the repeating cycle of the fraction 1/250 is 0, which begins at position 4 (as opposed to 0 which begins at positions 1 or 2 and as opposed to 00 which begins at positions 1 or 4).


Input
Each line of the input file consists of an integer numerator, which is nonnegative, followed by an integer denominator, which is positive. None of the input integers exceeds 3*10^3. End-of-file indicates the end of input.

Output

For each line of input, print the fraction, its decimal expansion through the first occurrence of the cycle to the right of the decimal or 50 decimal places (whichever comes first), and the length of the entire repeating cycle. 
 In writing the decimal expansion, enclose the repeating cycle in parentheses when possible. If the entire repeating cycle does not occur within the first 50 places, place a left parenthesis where the cycle begins - it will begin within the first 50 places - and place ``...)" after the 50th digit. 
 Print a blank line after every test case. 

For every input number N, output a single line containing the factorial of N.


Example

Sample Input:
76 25
5 43
1 397
Sample Output:
76/25 = 3.04(0)
   1 = number of digits in repeating cycle

5/43 = 0.(116279069767441860465)
   21 = number of digits in repeating cycle

1/397 = 0.(00251889168765743073047858942065491183879093198992...)
   99 = number of digits in repeating cycle
