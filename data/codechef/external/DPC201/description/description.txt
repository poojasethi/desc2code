 Apple 
        Trees

 

Apple trees in a garden form a rectangular grid. A 
        group of monkeys lives on these

trees. Not more than one monkey lives in each tree. A 
        monkey feels happy to believe that it is

the lord of all apple trees it views from the top of 
        the tree it lives in. However, as the trees are

of different heights a monkey can view trees that are 
        not obstructed from its view by other

trees. A monkey that views the maximum number T of 
        trees is a lord of lords. The undisputed

monarch is the lord of lords that lives in the highest 
        tree. In case two or more lord of lords

have the claim to be the monarch then monarchy is 
        disputed.

Assume that the ground of the garden is plane; 
        vertical straight lines represent trees;

trees are at a distance of unity row-wise or 
        column-wise; and the height of each tree is an

integer in the unit of the distance. A tree of height 
        zero in a position indicates absence of a

tree on that position. Visibility of a tree R from the 
        top of a tree P depends on heights and

locations of P, R and other trees. A tree R is 
        invisible from the top of a tree P if and only if

there exists a visible tree Q that lies on the 
        vertical plane containing P and R and is located

between P and R so that the top of R is either on or 
        below, the line joining tops of P and Q.

Write a program to locate the undisputed monarch, 
        given heights of all trees.



        Input

The input may contain multiple test cases.

For each test case, the first line gives two integers 
        m and n representing respectively

the total number of rows and columns of trees in the 
        garden. Each of the next m lines

contains n integers representing heights of trees in a 
        row. The jth integer in the ith row

represents the height of the tree in ith row and jth 
        column of the garden. Assume that the

garden contains no more than 200 trees.

The input terminates with an input 0 as the first 
        input for a test case.



 



        Output

For each test case output three integers r, c and T in 
        one line. Integers r and c

represent the location of the undisputed monarch, 
        where r is the row number and c is the

column number of the tree on which the monarch lives. 
        In case monarchy is disputed, both r

and c are zero. The integer T represents the total 
        number of trees visible to a lord of lords.
