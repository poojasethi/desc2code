You have M identical eggs. You want to determine the maximum height that you can drop an egg from a building of N floors without breaking it (or determine if the egg does breaks even when dropped from the first floor). Let us call this maximum safe height the critical height.
Our eggs have a unique property: they can withstand one fall from a height greater than the critical height. If the same egg falls from a height greater than the critical height for a second time, it breaks, and it can't be used again. You can use an egg any number of times as long as it is not broken.
What is the minimum number of throws you need to determine the critical height in the worst case assuming you follow an optimal strategy?
Input: The first line contains the number of test cases T. Each of the next T lines contains two integers N and M each.
Output: Output T lines, containing the required answer for the corresponding case.
Constraints: 1 <= T <= 1000 1 <= N,M <= 300
Sample Input: 3 2 1 3 2 5 2
Sample Output: 3 4 5
Explanation:
For the first example, N = 2 and M = 1. One strategy is to throw the egg from the first floor twice (note that our special eggs cannot break the very first time you throw it). If the egg breaks, the critical height is 0. Otherwise, throw the egg from second floor twice to determine its critical height. This requires 4 throws in the worst case.
However, there is a better strategy. First throw the egg from floor 2, then from floor 1. If the egg breaks on the second throw, the critical height is 0. If it does not, throw it once again from floor 2 and check if it breaks. This requires just 3 throws in the worst case.
A character string is said to have period k if it can be formed by concatenating one or more repetitions of another string of length k. For example, the string "abcabcabcabc" has period 3, since it is formed by 4 repetitions of the string "abc". It also has periods 6 (two repetitions of "abcabc") and 12 (one repetition of "abcabcabcabc").
