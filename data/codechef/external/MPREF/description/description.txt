Recommending systems are very popular now.Many commercial websites use it to recommend items to their users.Sometimes merging preferences is a difficult task because different users have different preferences.
A user's preference is a linear order of items.
For example there are 3 items, namely 1,2,3 and 3 users.
The first user prefers item 1 to item 2 and prefers item 2 to item 3.
So his/her preference is 1 2 3.
The second user's preference is 2 1 3.
And the third user's preference is 3 2 1.
How can we merge the 3 preferences?
If we merge them to get a preference P we can calculate the badness of it.
It can be defined as the total number of pairs that Disobey in all the linear orders.

So the badness of 1 2 3 is 0 + 1 + 3 = 4 because  1 2 disobeys the second preference and all the 3 pairs  disobey the third preference.
The badness of 1 3 2 is 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.
The badness of 2 1 3 is 1 + 0 + 2 = 3.
The badness of 2 3 1 is 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.
The badness of 3 1 2 is 2 + 3 + 1 = 6.
The badness of 3 2 1 is 3 + 2 + 0 = 5.

So if we let P = 2 1 3 , the minimal badness is 3.


Input

Given N users preferences of M items, calculate the minimal badness of merged preference.
The first line of input is 2 integers, N  and M .
Each of the next n lines is a permutation of integers from 1 to M.

Output

Just output the minimal badness of merged preference in a single line.

Example

Input:
3 3
1 2 3
2 1 3
3 2 1

Output:
3


Constraints

 0 < N < 21 
 0 < M < 10001
