An arithmetic progression is a sequence of numbers a1, a2,... an such that ai+1-ai is equal for all 0≤i<n. This difference is called the common difference of the arithmetic progression.

Now consider a sequence of arithmetic progressions A1 = (a1,1, a1,2,... a1,n1), A2 = (a2,1, a2,2,... a2,n2),... Ak = (ak,1, ak,2,... ak,nk)

 A progressive progression is such a sequence with the additional properties that:

 ai,ni = ai+1,1 for 1 ≤ i < k
 ci, the common difference of Ai, is a positive factor of ai,1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ k
 ci<ci+1 for 1 ≤ i < k
 ni >1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ k
 k ≥ 1


Find the number of progressive progressions such that a1,1k,nk = N. As this number can be quite large, output it modulo 100000007.


Input
The first line of input contains T (≤ 100), the number of testcases. This is followed by the description of the testcases. The description of each testcase consists of a single integer N (1 < N ≤ 1000000).


Output
For each testcase, output modulo 100000007 the number of progressive progressions such that a1,1k,nk = N
