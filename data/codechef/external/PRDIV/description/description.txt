Problem Description

You are given n integers.You are also given another integer x which is prime.Now your task is simple.
You have to find the length of the largest sub-array,in which all the elements are divisible by x.

Input Format

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then it is followed by T cases.
The first line of each test case contains an integer n denoting the number of elements in the array. Then it is followed by n space separated integers.
Then the next line of the input contains an integer q denoting the number of queries.Then q lines follow each having a prime number.

Output Format

For each query, output a single line containing the answer for that query.
