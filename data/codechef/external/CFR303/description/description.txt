Your job is to write a program which determines the maximum number of 2, 3 and 5 which should be multiplied to calculate the factorial of particular number.
For example: 6!=6*5*4*3*2*1=(3*2)*(5)*(2*2)*(3)*(2)*(1), So the number of 2s which are multiplied here are 4, number of 3s=2 and number of 5s=1


Input
First line of input consists number of test cases T (not more than 10). First line of each test case consists of positive integer N (1<=N<=500)


Output
For each test case, first line of output should consists number of 2s which are multiplied in the factorial of N, second line should consists number of 3s which are multiplied in the factorial of N and third line should consists number of 5s which are multiplied in the factorial of N.
