 
Shubh loves death metal,he has an opportunity to get selected as lead singer in metallica,but he has to solve a question to qualify for the auditions.There is a list of N songs of metallica from song 1 to N, he has to the identify the year of each song strictly in the order as given in the problem set (1 to N).Question i(1<=i<=N) contains pi options, exactly one of them is correct.

The selection of every option takes 1 second. The aim is to answer all the N problems correctly. If he selects a wrong option for any problem then all the selected answers become unselected and test starts from the very beginning(from 1st question again).

He is too sharp, but his luck is not favoring him today. One good thing is that he remembers everything. The order of answers for each problem and the order of problems remain unchanged, as well as the problem and answers themselves.

How much time (in seconds) will he take to perform in worst case?

 

Input
The first line contains a positive integer n. It is the number of questions in the test. The second line contains space-separated n positive integers pi, the number of answer variants to question i.


Output
Print a single numeric value — the minimal time (in seconds) needed to pass the test it the worst-case scenario.

Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 1000
1 ≤ pi ≤ 10^9

 

Example
Input:
