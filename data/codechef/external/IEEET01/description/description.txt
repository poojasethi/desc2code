A circular prime is a prime number with the property that the number generated at each intermediate step when cyclically permuting its (base 10) digits will be prime. Simply if all the rotational digits of a number are themselves prime It is called a prime number. For an example 1193 is a circular prime because 1931, 9311, 3119 are also prime. So according to above description first 10 circular primes will be 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 37, 79, 113. In this problem you are supposed to fine the number of circular primes below a given limit. 


Important: The combination of each circular is primes are neglected when counting. That means only the lowest number is counting. 


Input
 The first line will contain the number of cases and the next lines will give the limit.


Sample Input
4
10
20
50
200

Output
The output must contain the number of circular primes below that each given limit


Sample Output

Number of circular primes below 10 is 4
Number of circular primes below 20 is 7
Number of circular primes below 50 is 8
Number of circular primes below 200 is 12
