 A circular cake of radius  r   is placed with center at (x,y)  on an infinite 2-D grid. Shubhv is standing at  (x0, y0)  and can move at  v  units/second. She can move in any direction and want to get out of the cake as soon as possible. What is the minimum time in which she can reach a point  outside  or  on the boundary of   the cake?


Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.


Each test case consists of a single line containing 6 integers denoting  r, x, y, x0, y0, v  in order.


Output

For each test case output a single number  rounded to 6 decimal places  which denotes the minimum time in which Shubhv can walk out of the cake.


Output within an absolute or relative error of 10^-6 will be considered correct.


Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤  10 ^ 5  
 1  ≤ r  ≤  10^9  
-10 ^9  ≤ x, y, x0, y0  ≤  10^9  
1 ≤ v ≤  10 ^ 5

2 0 0 1 0 1
5 4 4 9 4 7
10 3 4 5 6 10

Output:

1.000000
0.000000
0.717157
