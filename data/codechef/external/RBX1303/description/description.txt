Mrs Pattinson instructs her students to write a code to find if a given 4 digit year is a Perfect Year or no. But her definition of a Perfect Year is a little different. According to her a Perfect Year is the one, the lower or higher two digits (or both) of which is a perfect square and the root obtained is also a perfect square

Input
The single line of input is a 4 digit year.

Output
The output is either 1 for Perfect Year or -1 for an Imperfect Year.

Example

Input:
1981

Output:
1

Explanation
Consider the input 1981, the lower two digits are 81 and higher two digits are 19. 81 is a perfect square having square root 9 and 9 also is a perfect square having square root 3. Hence the output 1.
Consider the input 2025, the lower two digits are 25 while higher two digits are 20. Though 25 is a perfect square, itâ€™s square root 5 is not a perfect square.
For the input 8116, both lower and higher two digits are perfect squares and their square roots are also perfect squares.
