Mr. Rohit has recently been promoted as the Vice President of the company he works, to celebrate the occasion he decided to call his friends to the party at his place. His friends are a bit choosy in selecting tables. There are N tables at the party numbered from 1 to N. They will be glad if they are allowed to sit on their chosen table. It is also very much possible that more than one table can make Rohit’s friends happy.

There are X friends which Rohit circled out to call at the party, numbered from 1 to X.

Now Mr. Rohit wants to know the maximum number of friends that he can make happy.


Input

Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the total number of friends who will be happy at the party.
