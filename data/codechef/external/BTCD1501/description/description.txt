Problem Statement
Given a string S, you have to find the Pragyanically smallest string which is not a substring in the given string. This task is too easy for you. Here's the catch. The Pragyanical order of the strings is the one you see in the column names of an Excel spreadsheet i.e 
 a < b < c < d <..... < z < aa < ab ...... < az < ba. ....... 

Input
First line consists of a integer T denoting number of test cases.
Then T lines follow where each line consists of the string S.
S consists of only lowercase characters.

Output
Then T lines follow where each line consists of the answer to the solution

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ Length Of String S ≤ 10^5


Example
Input
2abcdaabbcc
Output
ed
Explanation
For the first test case "e" is the substring which is not present in the given string.
