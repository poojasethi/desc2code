Your task consists of evaluate a polynomial of degree n (0 <= n <= 999) represented by its n+1 coefficients of the form:
pn(x) = cnxn + cn-1xn-1 + … + c2x2 + c1x + c0

in each one of the k (1 <= k <= 100) points x1, x2, …, xk. The coefficients of the polynomial and the values where they will be evaluated are integers in the interval [-100, 100] that guarantees that the polynomial's evaluation is at the most 263 – 1.

Input

There will be multiple test cases, each one with 4 lines that are described below

n: degree of polynomial.

cn cn-1 … c2 c1 c0: coefficients of the polynomial separated by a single space.

k: number of points to evaluate the polynomial.

x1 x2 … xk-1 xk: points to evaluate the polynomial separated by a single space.

The final test case is a single line where n = -1 and this case should not be processed.

Output

For each test case you should print k + 1 lines of output, the very first line containing the case number and the following k lines with the result of the polynomial's evaluation in each one of the k given points. See the sample.
