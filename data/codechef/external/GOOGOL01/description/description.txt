Problem description. 

Once, The CSE department of ISM Dhanbad organizes a workshop on Competitive Programming. Guess what who is the guest of honor, Petr Mitrichev himself. On that occasion he gives a nice glimpse of how he started coding and got into Google. 
After he is done with his presentation, he asks the students to solve an Arithmetico-Geometric Series to check their skills. The A.G.P is as follows:





Since, the answer could be very large. So, you need to print the actual  answer mod 215372682525. 

 Note: Submissions are only allowed in C, C++ and Java.  

Input
First line contains a single integer T denoting the number of Test Cases. Then T lines follow. Each of the next T lines contain 4 space separated integers a d n x 

Output
Output the desired result as stated in the problem statement. Result of each test case must be presented in a new line.

Constraints
Should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have. Format it like:

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
0 ≤ a ≤ 100000
0 ≤ d ≤ 100000
0 ≤ n ≤ 100000
0 ≤ x ≤ 100000

 

Example
Input:
2
0 2 3 4
1 2 3 5

Output:
54
232
