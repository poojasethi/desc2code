Recently, Jack organized  a party where his N girlfriends came. Each of his girlfriend was wearing a colored dress and there are K different color dresses in total. For this party Jack hired a photographer who secretly took photos of his girlfriends. The next morning, Jack decided to upload some photos (as taken by photographer) on Facebook but he uploads only those photos which are "pretty" to gain more number of likes. A photo is said to be "pretty" if more than half of his girlfriends in it are wearing same colored dress. In other words, if there are G girlfriend in the photo, it is pretty if strictly more than G / 2 girlfriends have same colored dress.
