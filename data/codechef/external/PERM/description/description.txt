 
There are N numbers which has to be arranged. You are given M constraints of the form (a, b) which means that a has to appear before b in the arrangement. Compute the number of arrangements possible modulo 1000000007. 
 

Input
Input description.
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains 2 integers N denoting the number of numbers to arrange and M denoting the number of constraints. Each of the next M lines has a pair of space separated integers a and b denoting a constraint.
 

Output
Output description.
For each test case, output the number of arrangements modulo 1000000007.
 

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 5
1 ≤  N ≤ 20 
1 ≤  M ≤ 1000 
1 ≤  a,b ≤ N 
 

Example
Input:
1
3 1
1 3

Output:
3
 

Explanation
Example case 1. There are 3 possible permutations in which 1 comes before 3: 1 2 3, 1 3 2, 2 1 3.
