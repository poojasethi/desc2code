 
Naveen likes tazos very much and he has been collecting them since he was 8. But recently when he was coming to the college he lost his bag of tazos. He was very upset about that but then he came to know about Tazonia, a fest where people came to exhibit and sell their collection of tazos.
On a fine day Naveen went to Tazonia but he was late and all the shops were getting closed. He was the last customer and everyone was ready to give all the remaining tazos to Naveen. But the organiser of that event didn't want Naveen to take all the tazos and put a restriction on the shops from where he can collect the tazos.
