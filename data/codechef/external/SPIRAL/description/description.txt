 
You are given a 2d array having m rows and n columns.Write a program to print it in
Spiral
 form.

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers m denoting the number of rows and n denoting the no of columns.After that Array is taken as input.

 

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing output in spiral form.

 

Constraints
