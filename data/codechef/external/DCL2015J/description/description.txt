Sheldon , a student , was attending his Computer Science class .
His teacher asked him to compute pow(a,b) and he was able to solve the problem for a given number of test cases .
Seeing that Sheldon was able to solve the problem easily his teacher decided to make the next question a little tricky
she asked Sheldon to compute pow(a,pow(b,c)) modulo 10^9+7 for a given number of test cases.
Since he tried a lot but still got Time Limit Exceeded (tle) for this problem.
Sheldon asked you to help him solve this problem.



Input
The input consists of several test cases .
Each case is on a single line .
In each case , we are given three space separated integers a , b and c .
The input is terminated by a = b = c = -1 .

Output
For each test case , print exactly one line containing the value modulus 10^9 + 7.


Constraints
0 <= a , b , c <= 2^31 - 1

Sample Test cases
Input:
2 2 2
-1 -1 -1
Output:
16 
Note :
Assume 0^0 = 1
