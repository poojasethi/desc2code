 
The chef wants to play chess and is trained by his coach. The chef knows all the rules of playing chess. To test the chef, coach gives him an assignment.
Coach arranges 8 Queens on a chess board and asks chef to check and tell him whether any of the 8 queens is threatening any of the 7 other Queens. The chef is facing difficulty to find out. Your job is to help chef find whether all Queens are safe at their places and finally say whether the arrangement is valid or not.
A chess board is an 8 x 8 matrix of squares and Queens may move any direction along a row, column or diagonal. 
 

Input
The first line consist of T, which denotes the number of test cases. Following T lines consist of 8 space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., A8 which denote 8 columns of the Queens on the rows of a chess board, with 1 being the first column and 8 being the last, e.g. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 means the Queens are along the diagonal.
 

Output
Print "Yes" if all the Queens are safe, otherwise print "No" (without quotes) for every test case
Tips:

If there are T test cases, the output will contain T lines, with each line containing either Yes or No

 

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ Ai ≤ 8

 

Example
Input:
3
1 8 2 5 3 7 4 6
3 5 2 8 1 7 4 6
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
 
Output:
No
Yes
No
 

Explanation
Example case 1. Here Queen A4 with position (4,5) can kill Queen A6 with position (6,7) diagonally. Same is the case with Queen A5 and Queen A8. Hence this arrangement is not valid.
Example case 2. Here all the Queens are safe, hence this arrangement is valid.
Example case 2. Here all the Queens are arranged diagonally, hence this arrangement is valid.
