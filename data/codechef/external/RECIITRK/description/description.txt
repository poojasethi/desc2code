Alice, a girl from Wonderland, always likes to take challenges. That is why she appears in most of the programming challenges.
She visited NIT Durgapur campus recently and saw some emerging talents in competitive programming. As she is now tired of taking challenges, she is wondering if she could give a challenge to NIT Durgapur students. She is very excited about this and has prepared a challenge for them.
There are N forests in Wonderland each having at most one exit point and zero or more entry points. She wants you to design a race track consisting of two or more forests. Start and end point of the track should be in the same forest. As Alice knows that there are many valid tracks possible, she wants you to tell her the length of the longest race track. Print -1 if no such race track is possible.

 

Input
The first line contains T, the number of test cases.
Each test case begins with N, the number of forests in Wonderland.
Second line of each test case consists N space separated numbers. If ith number is A[i], then it means exit point of forest i is connected with one of the entry point of forest A[i]. If A[i] is -1, it means there is no exit point in ith forest.
 

Output
For each test case, output the length of the longest race track. Print -1 if no such race track is possible.
 

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ N ≤ 1000000
0 ≤ i ≤ N-1
-1 ≤ A[i] ≤ N-1 and A[i] != i

 

Example
Input:
1
23
4 4 1 4 13 8 8 8 0 8 14 9 15 11 -1 10 15 22 22 22 22 22 21

Output:
6
 

Explanation


In the given example, longest race track is 13 -> 11 -> 9 -> 8 -> 0 -> 4 -> 13.
