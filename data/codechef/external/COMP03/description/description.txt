You are a junior scientist at one of the centres of project SETI (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence). One day you were working on a project while listening to your radio and suddenly you hear some numbers being aired... As you tune the radio the chanting of numbers becomes clear and you hear something like this...

109 10
401 5
164 8
10212 3
216 7
121 9

After studying the numbers you came to know that the numbers in the right column is the radix or base in which the number on the left is expressed i.e the number 109 is expressed in base 10(decimal number).

Also the number on the left depicts a particular character in the ASCII chart i.e the number 109 10 means that 109 is a decimal number(base 10) and it is equivalent to the character 'm' in ASCII chart

Similarly the number 401 5 means that 401 is a number in base 5 (equal to 101 in decimal) and is equivalent to 'e' in ASCII chart.

thus the above sequence of numbers are decoded into the string 'method'

Keen to know more information you decide to create a program that will decode the numbers obtained into the character string.



Input
Line 1 number of characters N you want to decode
Next N lines containing the number and its radix by a space


Output
the decoded string


Example

Input:
6
109 10
401 5
164 8
10212 3
216 7
121 9 

Output:
method
