When every body gets in the morning there are only 'K' toffees left.
Given A and B, you have to tell the minimum 'N' which makes this distribution possible and 'K'.
Obviously the number of toffees can't b fractional or negative.

Input
One line containing no. of test cases 't' followed by 't' lines containing 'A' and 'B' each.

Output
in a single line output the N and K for each test case.

Constraints:


3 <= A <= 10
B <= A
test cases 't' < 100

Example:
Input:
1
3 2

Output:
23 4
