Snow leopard recently got a collection of ‘A’ really funny videos. He has a software which helps him make different playlists of C videos out of all the videos. Everytime he uses the software, he gets a new playlist eveytime. He found out the algorithm used by the software for this.
 	- Each video should be played.
      -Between the two videos, there should be atleast ‘B’ different videos.
Help snow leopard find the number of possible playlists.
Since the number of playlists may be too large, find
No. of playlists % 100003.

Input :
There is a single line having A B C
Where A – the total number of videos available
	   B – the minimum of different videos which have to played before a video can be repeated
	   C – The number of  videos that have be to there in the playlist.

Output – 
	A single line containing the total number of possible playlists % 100003.
Constraints –  

1 <= A <= 100
0 <= B <= 100
A <= C <= 100

Example
Input - 
50 5 100

Output - 
61860
