 You are given 3 numbers N, D and K . Consider all the permutations of number N. Find out the number of permutations that give K modulo D.

Input

The input consists of 3 space-separated numbers  N  ,   D   ,  K  

 

Output

Output the required answer.


Constraints

0 ≤ N ≤ 10^14
1 ≤ D ≤ 1000
0 ≤ K ≤ D - 1


Example
Input:
214 2 0

Output:
4
 

Explanation
214 has 6 permutations. Out of these the valid permutations are 124 , 142 , 214 , 412
