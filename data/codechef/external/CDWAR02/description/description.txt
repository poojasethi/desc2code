 
Hatim hates to carry luggage, but unfortunately he got a job to carry the luggage of his N friends in office. Each day, one of his N friends, gives him the luggage of a particular weight to carry. You will be given the weight of luggage of each friend in the array Weight, where Weight(i) is the weight of luggage of ith friend carried by Hatim on ith day. It is given that all the luggages carried by Hatim are distinct in their weights.
As Kevin assigned this job to Hatim, so for each day, he wants to know the number of days in future when Hatim will have to carry the luggage , having weight less than the weight of luggage of current day.
Please help Hatim for the same.
 

Input
The first line contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. In each test case, the following input will be present:
First line contains an integer N, where N represents the number of friends.
Next N line contains N integers, where ith line contains ith integer, which represents Weight(i).

Output
Output exactly T lines. Each line contains N integer separated by a space, where ith integer represents the number of luggage of future, which are less than the weight of luggage of the current day.
