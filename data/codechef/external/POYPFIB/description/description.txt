Sir Piyush loves Fibonacci numbers. He is fascinated about calculating the Fibonacci numbers.
The N^th  term of Fibonacci series (f(N)) is defined as
f(N) = f(N-1)+f(N-2).
where f(0)=0, f(1)=1.
Your task is to help Piyush to find the Fibonacci number he desires.

Input

The first line contains T ,the no. of test cases.
Next T test cases contain a single integer N.


Output

For each test case you must evaluate f(N) i.e. the N^th fibonacci modulo 1000000007.


Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10.
0 ≤ N ≤ 10000000000.

 

Example
Input:
2
5
9

Output:
5
34

Explanation
Following are the Fibonacci numbers (form 0 to 9)
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
hence f(5)=5 and f(9)=34.
