A team of robbers have entered the premises of the Bank of Chefland. The bank consists of a long corridor, with N cameras fitted along the corridor. To prevent being seen in the cameras, the robbers will generate K electric surges to disable the cameras. If a surge is generated between distance A and B (measured from one end of the corridor), then all cameras in the inclusive range get disabled.
Given the locations of the cameras and the region affected by each surge, print the total number of cameras disabled. All coordinates are measured from one end of the corridor.

INPUT
First line consists of two space-separated integers, N and KNext line contains N space-separated integers, where the i^th integer Ci indicated the coordinate of the i^th camera.Each of the next K lines contains two integers. i^th line contains integers Ai and Bi indicating the region affected by the i^th surge.

OUTPUT
Print a single integer, indicating the total number of cameras disabled by the surges.
