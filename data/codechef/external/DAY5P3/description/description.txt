 
Given a connected and undirected graph, a spanning tree of that graph is a subgraph that is a tree (graph without cycle(s)) and connects all the vertices together. A single graph can have many different spanning trees. A minimum spanning tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree for a weighted, connected and undirected graph is a spanning tree with weight less than or equal to the weight of every other spanning tree.
 

Input

First Line of the input will contain T representing the number of test cases.
First line of each test case will contain two space separated integers V and E representing Number of Vertices and Number of Edges respectively.
Next E lines will contain 3 space separate integers A, B, W which represents an edge between vertex A and B of weight W. 
Vertices will be labeled starting from 1. For example if V=5, the set of vertices is {1,2,3,4,5}

 

Output


Output should consist of V-1 lines where each line would represent an edge that it part of the MST. Each of the output line should have 3 space-separated integers A, B and W representing an edge between A and B which is of weight W.
The edges should be printed in increasing weights. Also, print such that A < B for each edge.


 

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
2 ≤ V ≤ 1000
1 ≤ E ≤ V * (V - 1) / 2
1 ≤ A, B ≤ V
1 ≤ W ≤ 10^6
