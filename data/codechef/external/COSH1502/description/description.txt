Problem description:
Sonu got bored of playing Solitaire all day, and has invented a new game of cards that he can play by himself. He takes a shuffled deck of cards with R red cards and B black cards. In each turn, Sonu draws a card. A red card awards him with  -r  points, while a black card awards him with  +b  points. He can stop drawing cards at any point he wishes. 
Sonu believes there must be a strategy which maximises his expected score over all possible draws on the deck. Help Sonu find this maximum expected score.

Input
First line will contain the integer n, the number of test cases. Each test case will consist of one line, containing the integers R, B, r and b.

Output
For each test case, output the expected score that Sonu can get with the optimal strategy. Output should be correct up to 6 decimal places.

Constraints

1 ≤ n ≤ 10
0 ≤ R, B ≤ 1000
1 ≤ r, b ≤ 10

 

Example
Input:
3
5 0 3 6
0 4 3 6
1 1 3 6


Output:
0.000000
24.000000
4.500000
 

Explanation
In the first case, Sonu knows there are no black cards left in the deck, and hence stops drawing cards immediately.
In the second case, Sonu knows there are no red cards left, and hence draws all cards.
