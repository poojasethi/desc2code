PRIME TRIPLES
The theorem
of Pythagoras was known long before Pythagoras (who lived c540 B.C.), the
earliest statement of it being in the Indian Sulbasutras
dated c800 B.C. The dimensions of Altars in India were based on Triples.
Triples are
sets of three numbers(integer, decimal , positive, negetive). Any Triple of the form a,b,c represent a right angled triangle which Base =
a; Height = b; Hypotenuse = C. We find that cosA =
a/c. Hence any triple represents an angle A.
A Prime
Triple is Triple if its elements are whole number and have no common factor. Forexample 3,4,5 and 24,7,25 are
Prime Triples, however, 6,8,10 is not because 2 is a common Factor.
Your task is
to determine whether a Triple is Prime or Not.
