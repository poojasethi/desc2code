Hackers! Hackers! Everywhere!
Some days back your email ID was hacked. Some one read the personal messages and Love Letters you sent to your girl friend. That's a terrible thing, well, you know how are the boys at ISM. So, you have decided that from now onwards you will write Love Letters to your girlfriend in a different way.
Suppose you want to write "i love you sweet heart", then you will write "I evol uoy teews traeh".
