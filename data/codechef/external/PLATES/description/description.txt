 

Company 'A' produces a special type of rectangular plate used for interior designing. They got an order from Company 'B' to supply them with all possible different rectangular plates of Area equal to 1 to X (Both inclusive). Selling price of one rectangular plate of any Area is Rs. 2. Company 'B' asked Company 'A' manager to tell them the Total Cost. Company 'A' manager is not good at maths so he asked you for help. You have to help Company 'A' manager to find the total cost of all the different plates of Area equal to 1 to X (Both inclusive). (See Example).
Note: Length of side of rectangular plate is always an Integer and rectangle with different dimensions are considered different for e.g 1*2 and 2*1 are two different plates


Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
Each test case consists of single integer X.

Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the total cost of plates of Area 1 to X ( both inclusive).

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ X ≤ 10^6

Sample Input

3

Sample Output

2

10

Explanation

In second test case total cost of all the different rectangular plates of Area 1 to 2 (Both inclusive) i.e. cost of plates with area equal to 1 + cost of plates with area equal to 2
No.of plates with area 1 = 1 (1*1)
No.of plates with area 2 = 2 (2*1 & 1*2)
Total cost = 1*(cost of one plate) + 2*(cost of one plate) = 1*2 + 2*2 = 6
