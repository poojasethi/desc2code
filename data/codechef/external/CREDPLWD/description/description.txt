 
The Roboliga team of Credenz '14 have bought a plywood. The plywood is a flat plane represented as a 2D matrix. Each element of a 2D matrix represents the weight of that particular part of the plywood.
Now the Roboliga team wants to cut a rectangular hollow piece of outer rectangle of size AxB and inner rectangle of size ((A-2)x(B-2)) from the plywood which satisfies the following conditions:
All the blocks on the hollow rectangular piece have equal weight.
The area covered by the outer rectangle is maximum i.e. product of A and B is maximum.
Note that pieces of dimensions less than or equal to 2 are allowed. Such pieces would not be hollow.
 

Input
First line contains two integers M and N
Next M lines contain N space-separated integers: the description of the matrix
 

Output
Output the maximum area of the hollow rectangle.
 

Constraints
1 <= M <= 100
1 <= N <= 100
1 <= ai <= 10^9


Example
Input:
7 7
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
7 9 9 9 9 2 4
1 9 3 4 9 6 7
7 9 9 9 9 2 4
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
7 6 5 1 3 2 4
1 2 3 4 5 6 7

Output:
12
