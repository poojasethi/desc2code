Roger was having fun solving his problems until he found this one.As you know, an undirected connected graph with N nodes and N-1 edges is called a tree.
You are given an integer 'K' and a tree consisting of 'N' nodes. Each node 'i' has a value a(i) associated with it.
We call a path 'P' of tree valid if following conditions are satisfied:

 P has atleast 2 nodes associated with it.

Max a(u) - Min a(u) ≥ K (u belongs to the nodes present in the chosen P).
Your task is to count the number of Valid Paths.


Input
The first line contains two space-separated integers N and K.
The second line contains N space-separated positive integers a(1), a(2), ..., a(n).
Then the next n - 1 line each contain pair of integers u and v denoting that
 there is an edge between u and v.


Output
Print the number of Valid Paths.
Note:
The nodes are numbered from 1 to N.


Constraints
1 ≤ N ≤ 5000
1 ≤ u,v ≤ N
0 ≤ K ≤ 10^9
0 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9


Example


Input:
3 1
1 2 3
1 2
2 3


Output:
3
