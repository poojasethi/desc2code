 
Given two ints A and B, find value of function G(A,B) which is defined as Sum(F(x)) where A<=x<=B.

F(x) is defined as the number of ways to reach xth staircase from ground given you take either 1 or 2 consecutive steps.
 

Input
First line consists of t, the number of test cases.

t lines follow. Each test case consist of 2 integers A and B..

Output
For each case, output the value of G(A,B) mod 10^9 + 7.
 

Constraints

t =  10000
1 <= A <= B <= 1000000000(10^9) 

 

Example
Input:
10000
1 1
2 3
.
.

Output:
1
5
.
.
 

Explanation
G(1,1)=F(1)=1
G(2,3)=F(2)+F(3)=2+3=5
F(3)=Number of ways to reach staircase 3.
Ways to reach staircase 3 are [1,1,1],[1,2],[2,1].
