 
Rohan, a young scientist, has developed a new programming language. In his new language, he has developed a special type of operator which he has termed as digit-wise operator. The language is in its Beta phase, so as of now, there are only two digit-wise operator which are + and *. The digit-wise operator + performs digit wise addition, while * performs digit wise multiplication. They work almost the same as bitwise operator work, differing only in the aspect that instead of working on bits, they work on digits of integers, also it outputs only the last digit of the result and the digit is printed in words (where all character are in lower case English alphabets).
Given an expression consisting of two operands A and B, and a digit-wise operator, output the result it would produce.

 

Input
The first line of input contains T, the number of test cases.  Each line of test case contains two space separated integers followed by a space, and then, the operand i.e. one of the digit-wise operator (+ or *).

Output
For each test case, output the result that has been asked for in the problem statement.
 

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
1 ≤ A ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ B ≤ 10^5

 

Example
Input:
2
1324 3950 +
6139 3850 *

Output:
four two seven four
eight eight five zero
