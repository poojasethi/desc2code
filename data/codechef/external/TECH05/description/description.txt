Your task in this problem is very straightforward. You are given a point in the cartesian plane (m,n) where m>0 and n>0. You start at (0,0) and are allowed to make unit moves along the positive x-axis or the positive y-axis. In other word if you are at a point (x,y) you can move to either (x+1,y) or (x,y+1). Your task is to find out the total number of ways you can reach (m,n) from (0,0) modulus K.


Input

First line contains 'T', the number of testcases(T ≤ 50). The next 'T' lines contain three space separated integers m,n,K 1 ≤ m,n ≤ 1,000 K ≤ 1,000,000


Output
A single integer denoting the total number of paths mod K.
