Problem description
Manasvi has just learn about factorials in his high school mathematics class .He loved the concept of factorials so much that he decided to make a printed chart of factorials to decorate his room with ' just another mathematical stuff ', but soon he realized that it is quite difficult to find factorials of every number by himself and even Google was showing the result in exponential form. After hours of struggle, he approaches you ,to help him find factorials in  pure integer form (not exponential). 

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number whose factorial is to be found .


Output

For each test case, output a single line containing the required result. 


Constraints
