The classical Mobius function µ(n) is an important multiplicative function in number theory and combinatorics. µ(n) is defined for all positive integers n and has its values in {-1, 0, 1} depending on the factorization of n into prime factors. It is defined as follows:

* µ(n) = 1 if n is a square-free positive integer with an even number of prime factors.
* µ(n) = -1 if n is a square-free positive integer with an odd number of prime factors.
* µ(n) = 0 if n is not square-free.
Given N, find the number of tuples (a,b) with 1<=a<=N and 1<=b<=N, such that µ(a*b) = µ(a) * µ(b)

Input
The first line of input contains a number T(1<=T<=10), the number of test cases.
Then T lines follow, each containing a single number N(1<=N<=100000).


Output
Output T lines, one line for each input, containing the number of tuples satisfying stated property.


Example

Input:
3
1
2
4


Output:
1
3
14

Explanation:
In case of N=4, only the tuples (2,2) and (3,3) do not satisfy the required condition, the other 14 tuples do.
