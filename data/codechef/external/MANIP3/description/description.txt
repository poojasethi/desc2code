Babloo wanted to make Babli a friendship band. He wanted it to read 'str' on her wrist. Once he'd done that and Babli had put it on, he realized that apart from str, a lot of other sentences could be read by changing the first word of the sequence. For example “Babli is the best: Babloo” could also be read “the best: BablooBabli“ on her wrist. So, we give you n different str strings followed by a weird sequence like the one in the example, all you have to do is tell us if it can be read off the string or not.


 Input
