As Dheeru  wants to go out with his girlfriend now, he wants you to solve the following problem for him. You are given a Siddhu array consisting of N integers in which Ai denotes ith element of the array.
There are Q queries and each query consists two integers L and R. For each query output the number of Siddhu Primes in between L and R (both inclusive).
A Siddhu Prime number is defined as a number present in the Siddhu array and has only 2 positive divisors.

Input
First line contains an integer N denoting the size of array.
Next line contains N space separated integers Ai of the array.
Next line contains an integer Q denoting the number of queries.
Each of the next Q lines contain two space separated integers L and R as described in the problem.

Output
For each query, output your answer in a single line.

Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6
1 ≤ Ai ≤ 10^6
1 ≤ Q ≤ 10
1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ 10^6

 

Example
Input:
5
4 3 1 7 12
2
1 8
4 13
Output:
2
1

Explanation
Query 1. The two numbers are 3 and 7
Query 2. The only Siddhu Prime number is 7.
