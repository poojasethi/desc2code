The New Zealand government is super-excited about the Cricket World Cup 2015 happening in their country. Hence, it has decided to conduct a census on cricket to find out how many people are interested in the sport, etc.
The statistics obtained are given to us as a range of numbers from A to B (inclusive). In these statistics, the government is interested in some particular numbers called "Kiwi Numbers".
A number is called a Kiwi Number if it has a prime number of distinct factors. A prime number N has exactly two divisors, 1 and N.
Can you help the government by calculating the number of Kiwi numbers in the given range? 
Input: The first line contains the number of test cases T. Each of the next T lines contains two space separated numbers A and B.
Output: For each test case, output the required answer on a separate line.
Constaints: 1 <= T <= 100 2 <= A <= B <= 1000000000 B - A <= 200000
Sample Input: 3 2 10 100 100 578 720
Sample Output: 6 0 23
Explanation: For the first case, the Kiwi numbers are 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9.
