An interesting topic in real analysis is convergence of series. E.g., consider the following summationThe summation converges for all integer values of n≥2.For different values of n, find what the series converges to. Print the convergent sum as a fraction P/Q in it's lowest form, i.e., gcd(P,Q)=1.

INPUT
First line contains T, number of testcases.Each of the next T lines contain a single integer N.

OUTPUT
For each test case, print a single line answer for that case.
