 
Given an array of length N containing integers  A1, A2, A3, ... AN . Given m queries of the form (l,r) find the maximum length of continuous subsequence (Ai, Ai+1, ...Aj) such that l ≤ i ≤ j ≤ r and (Ai + Ai+1 + Ai+2 + ... Aj) mod k = 0.
 

Input
First line of input contains three numbers N,m,k - length of array, number of queries, and number used to take modulus with.
Next line will contain N integers denoting the value of elements of array.
Next m lines will contain two integers l and r denoting a single query.

 

Output
Print a single line for each query with the maximum length satisfying the given condition. If no such subsequence exist for a query print "0" (without quotes).

 

Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4
0 ≤ Ai ≤ 10^9
2 ≤ k ≤ 10^6
1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ N
