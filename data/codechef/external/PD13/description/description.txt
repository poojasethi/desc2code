Given a natural number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500000), please output the summation of all its proper divisors.

Definition: A proper divisor of a natural number is the divisor that is strictly less than the number.

e.g. number 20 has 5 proper divisors: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, and the divisor summation is: 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 = 22.



Input

An integer stating the number of test cases (equal to about 200000), and that many lines follow, each containing one integer between 1 and 500000 inclusive.


Output

One integer each line: the divisor summation of the integer given respectively.


Example

Input:

3
2
10
20

Output:

1
8
22
