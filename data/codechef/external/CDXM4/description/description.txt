you have to convert a code for the old version of compiler to the
code for a new version of compiler.
In the old compiler we have used "->" for pointers and the new compiler use "." for pointers.Now we need to replace each "->" with "." but not in the comments of the code.A comment starts with "//" in the line and terminates at the end of the line.
 


Input


Max. 2000 lines of code
each line of code have maximum of 60 characters.



Output

The new code with required changes.



Example
Input:

int t;   //variable t
t->a = 0;    // -> denotes the pointer
t->c = 5;
return 0;  // -> is not used


Output:
int t;   //variable t
t.a = 0;   // -> denotes the pointer
t.c = 5;
return 0;  // -> is not used 
 

Explanation

"->" is not converted to "." in the comments of 2nd and 4th line.
