Two friends Alice and Bob were once quarreling among themselves as to who will get hold of the box of chocolates brought by their aunt.
Alice, shrewd and cunning as she is, makes a plan to stop this issue and get hold of the box. She challenged Bob a problem which he has to solve then and there only in front of her. The problem is stated very simply as:
Given an array of N non - negative integers  ai, and a number K, Bob can remove elements from either side of the array, i.e either from first or last, such that the resultant array satisfies the condition that
max(ai) - min (ai) = K.
He has to minimize the number of elements removed and hence find the length of the resultant array. The resultant array must obey the condition above after removing elements from the sides. If there is no length which satisfies above then print "0" (quotes for clarity).
Input
The first line contains T which denotes the number of test cases.
Then for each test case we have 2 lines, N and K.
Then the next line has N space separated integers ai.
Output
For each test case print the corresponding answer.
Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 5
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
0 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9
0 ≤ K ≤ 10^9
Example
Input:
2
4 4
2 3 4 6
3 3
1 2 3
Output:
4
0


Explanation:
The first example, Bob doesn't need to remove anything as the whole array satisfies it.
The second example, even if Bob removes everything, there is no possibility hence the remaining length is 0.
