Girish has recently joined IISc. Being a highly enthusiastic
student he wants to attend as many classes as possible. He has
prepared a list of classes he wants to attend along with their timings.
But he realizes that he can not attend all the classes as some of
their timings clash with each other. Given the schedule of classes,
help Girish identify the maximum number of classes he can attend.


Input
The first line of input contains 'T', the number of test cases (1 ≤ T ≤ 1000). This is followed by 'T' test cases. Each test case consists of a blank line followed by one line containing a number 'C', the number of classes (1 ≤ C ≤ 1000000). This is followed by 'C' lines, each containing two integers representing the start and end times of each class.



Output
The output should consist of 'T' lines corresponding to the 'T' test cases. Each line should contain one number, which is the maximum number of classes that can be attended.
