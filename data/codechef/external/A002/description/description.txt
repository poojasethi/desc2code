On reaching the final frontier of the Galaxy , Sector 64 , the crew found themselves in a situation they had not anticipated .

The base they were supposed to land on was completely destroyed without any trace .
All they found on the base was a Teleport channel , an encrypted key and some encrypted data , apparently left behind by mistake .
The captain decided to investigate and find out where the Teleport channel leads to and what information were left behind .
To do this , he has to decrypt the key and find a code to decode the information and unlock the Teleport channel .

The key had been encrypted using an ancient encryption algorithm .
In this algorithm , a digit is preceded as well as succeeded by a certain number of characters which decides the position
of the digit in the unencrypted code .

The encrypted key has the following characters and their relative weight-age :

Z      the basic charcacter ( may be considered of unit value )
Q      equivalent to 3 Z 
E      equivalent to 5 Z
T      equivalent to 7 Z
U      equivalent to 9 Z

The characters which precede a digit add to its weight-age and which succeed a digit subtract from its weigh-age .
The position of a digit in the unencrypted code is decided on the basis of its weight-age , the digit with the least weight-age is the left most and the digit with the most weight-age is the right most .
In case of same weight-age for two digits , the digit that appears later in the encrypted key appears earlier in the unencrypted code .

Example : 

ZZZE5UU7QQZZ7T3QQQQ4EEZ 

weight-age of 5 : (3x1) + (1x5) - (2x9) = -10 
weight-age of 7 : (2x9) - (2x3) - (2x1) = 10 
weight-age of second 7 : (2x3)+(2x1) - (1x7) = 1
weight-age of 3 : (1x7) - (4x3) = - 5
weight-age of 4 : (4x3) - (2x5) - (1x1) = 1


Implying the unencrypted code is :
