Gordon breathed heavily.
"We can't take a chance. This is our only hope."
Hiding under the shadow of Wayne Tower, he and Lucius Fox looked over the hordes of prisoners being released from Blackgate Penitentiary. They were arming up to attack downtown.
"They need to cross the Riverwaith Bridge. Due to the damage we caused to it, they can only cross it in a single file. We must use this opportunity to cripple them." said Fox.
"I have my undercover officers ready. They have already infiltrated the prisoners."
"Hmm, we better give them instructions to position them in the file. I suggest we place the officers such that we keep the prisoners most separated. This will give us a strategic advantage when we strike."
Input:
First line: one number t , indicating number of test cases
 t < 10^6
Next t lines: two space separated numbers indicating the number of prisoners (p) and the number of undercover cops (c).
0<=c<=p<=10^9
Output:
A single number (for each test case) ,which tells us the minimum possible consecutive prisoners in the single file, after optimally placing the undercover cops.
Sample Input:
