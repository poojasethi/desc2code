 
The final of Cricket Super Cup is finally here.  India has restricted arch rivals Pakistan to a score of ‘S’ runs. Now they have to chase this score in ‘n’ balls. Since it’s a Super Cup, the regular cricketing rules won’t do justice to the name of the cup. Runs on each ball could be quite large here.  On the ith ball, player can score either di or 0 runs. Dhoni,  quite confident about his win, wonders what are the number of ways of scoring exactly ‘S’ runs and end the match in a draw so that there could be a super over. Since he is weak in math, he has asked you to apply your coding skills and tell him the answer before India goes for batting.
 

Input
First line contains two integers  n and S.
n -> the number of balls
S -> runs to score to end the match in a draw.
Next n lines contain n integers  ‘di’, the number of runs a player can score on the ith ball.


Output
Output a single integer which is the answer to Dhoni’s problem.

Constraints

1 ≤ n ≤ 40
1 ≤ S ≤ 10^9
1 ≤ di ≤ 10^9
