 
Mo wants to get an internship at  an electronics plant, it's known from past experience that the probability is x  that a new intern who has attended the company's training program will meet  the qualification criteria, and that the corresponding probability is  y  for a new intern who has not attended the company's training program.  k  interns of all  n  new interns attend the training program.
Mo is now sad that he did not qualify for the intern. What is the probability that he did not attend the company's training program?
 

Input
