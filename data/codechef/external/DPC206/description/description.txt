        A simple recursive method to generate a numeric palindrome from any 
        number is to reverse its digits and add it to the original. If the sum is not a 
        palindrome (which means, it is not the same number from left to right and right 
        to left), repeat this procedure. For example for 195:


    195 + 951 = 786


    786 + 687 = 1473


    1473 + 3741 = 5214


    5214 + 4125 = 9339 
        Resulting palindrome

 

 In 
        this particular case the palindrome 9339 appeared after 4th addition. This 
        method leads to palindromes in a few step for almost all of the integers. But 
        there are interesting exceptions. 196 is the first number for which no 
        palindrome has been found. It is not proven though, that there is no such a 
        palindrome.


         

 Your 
        task is to write a program that gives the resulting palindrome and the number of 
        iterations (additions) to compute it. All tests data in this problem will have 
        an answer, will be computable with less than 1000 iterations (additions), which 
        will yield a palindrome that is not greater than 4,294,967,295.

 


 Input


         
        

         
        The first line will have a number N (0<N<=100) with the number of test 
        cases, the next N lines will each have a number P to compute its palindrome.

 



        Output

         
        For each of the N numbers you will have to write a line with the minimum 
        number of iterations (additions) to get to the palindrome and the resulting 
        palindrome separated by one space.
