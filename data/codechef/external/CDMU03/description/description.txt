 
A school assignment required Sanchez to calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum value of a given mathematical expression. With great help from his teacher, after going in for extra hours of study, he was able to complete his assignment. But, as his friends not used to him putting in so much effort into studies and for that missing his football practice decided to play a prank.
They erased the brackets, which were important for the understanding of the expression and Sanchez was left clueless as to the explanation and the answer.
Your task is simple. You will have to help Sanchez.
He is given a mathematical expression involving '+' and '*'. This expression does not contain any brackets or parentheses. Your task is to help Sanchez find the difference between maximum and minimum values obtained by placing brackets in the given expression.
It is guaranteed that both the answer values will be between 0 to 2^64 - 1 (inclusive).
The total length of the string will not be more than 100

Input
Input description.
First line of the input contains the number of test cases T. (1 <= T <= 100)
Each of the T lines contains expression consisting only of non-negative integers xi (0 ≤ xi ≤ 10) and binary operators “+”
and "*".

Output
Output T lines. Each line contains a number which will be the difference between maximum and the minimum number which can be formed from the expression.
 

Example
Input:
1
2+1*0


Output:
2

 

Explanation
 minimum value is 0 while the maximum value is 2.
