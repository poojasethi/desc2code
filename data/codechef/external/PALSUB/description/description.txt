This TechNITi, Billi's intelligence is tested in a very different way by his girlfriend. His girlfriend has given him a binary string .

She asked Billi to remove palindromic subsequences from the given binary string of length N.
Find minimum number of palindromic subsequences he needs to remove such that the string becomes empty.


Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
First line of every test case is integer N the length of string
 Second line is the binary String

Output
Output a single integer for each test case corresponding to the answer.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 1000 ,T is the number of test cases.
1 ≤ N ≤ 1000000 ,N is the length of the string.
N*T will always be less than 1000000.

Example
Input:
1
9
101001101

Output:
2

Explanation
1001 and 10101 are the two subsequences.
