Pratik has to jump from the present tile to the next-to-next tile and so on to reach the end, until he can't jump anymore. He also has to keep on adding the numbers of the tile he has landed on. What will be the sum Pratik has calculated after he has completed jumping.

Input
The First line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. Each test case will have two space separated numbers N and K.


Output
For each test case output a single integer which is the sum calculated by Pratik.
