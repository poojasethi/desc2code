On being teleported through the teleport channel , the crew reach Earth and find that the invaders have attacked the planet .
They decide to join the war against the invaders .

Based on information available , the crew of the ship decides to analyze the probability of the Mother-ship of the invaders being in a sector and then focus their attacks on the ones with highest probability .

They decide the probability of the Mother-ship being in a particular sector based on the amount of protection it gets from the supporting Frigates in the grid .
There are eight Frigates in the grid and no two of them are in the same sector .

The protection a sector receives from a Frigate is decided as follows : 
  
Every Frigate has the ability to protect any sector in the row , column and diagonal it is located in .
But it's ability to protect is maximum when the sector is just adjacent to it in it's row or column ( let us just call it as Protection Status 14 ) and then gradually falls at a rate of 2 units per sector as the distance increases ( as in , the sector next to its adjacent sector has Protection Status as 12 and so on ) . 
The protection of a sector along its diagonal is half the protection of a sector at same distance along the row or column , as in , the Protection Status of a sector adjacent to a frigate along its diagonals is 7 and it falls of as the distance increases at a rate of 1 unit per sector .

Also , if a sector is protected by more than one frigate , the Protection Status of that sector is the sum of the protections provided by all the Frigates for the sector in the grid .

Example 

The map of the galaxy being : 


               64  63  62  61  60  59  58  57
               49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56
               48  47  46  45  44  43  42  41
               33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40
               32  31  30  29  28  27  26  25
               17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24
               16  15  14  13  12  11  10  09
               01  02  03  04  05  06  07  08



In the 8x8 grid , if a Frigate is at Sector 12  , it protects the following sectors ( with the Protection Status in bracket ) .

Row Elements : 11(14) , 10(12) , 09(10) , 13(14) , 14(12) , 15(10) , 16(08)  . 
Column Elements : 05(14) , 21(14) , 28(12) , 37(10) , 44(08) , 53 (06) . 

Diagonal Elements : 22(7) , 26(6) , 40(5), 04(7) , 20(7) , 30(6) , 34(5) , 48(4) , 06(7) .  



It can be taken for granted that the Mother-ship in not in a sector where a Frigate is .
If more than one sector has same protection status which also happens to be the highest , 
the sector numbers are to be output in an increasing order .
