The inhabitants of the Holumba Island use a language which uses palindromes. Every word in the language is a palindrome. The Holumbians have a kept a dictionary of all their words in a secret system to prevent the enemy islands from stealing it. But, the enemy island hackers have hacked into the secret system and have messed up the dictionary. You have to convert all the wrong words written by the enemy hackers into the original words of the Holumbians.
