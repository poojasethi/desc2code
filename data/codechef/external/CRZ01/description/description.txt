On a wonderful rainy day, a little champ was wandering in the street. He was so sad because he had no power to fight against the monster, meanwhile there was a magical rain with power-boosters, the value of each power booster is a positive number. The product of power boosters is a constant.
Let us consider a1, a2, a3…..,an are the powers of the power-boosters a1*a2*a3….. *an =k. So help the champ to determine his optimal power to face the monster by calculating the minimum of a1+ a2+ a3…..+an. (If he defeats the monster he can become the prince of the Magical World).


Input
First line contains T (number of test cases).
Next T lines contain n, k.

Output
T lines producing the required answer rounded up to 6 decimal digits.

Constraints
1<=T<=1000
 
1<=N<=10^3

Example
Input:
1
2 4

Output:4.000000
