A number is said to be a palindrome if it remains the same when it is read backwards. Eg. 12021 is pallindrome while 21 is not
A number is called total-palindromic if it contains a palindrome with odd length greater than 1 and an even palindrome as a substring.
For example, the number 22676 is total-palindromic whereas the number 101 is not because it contains the palindrome of odd length 676 and even length 22. While 101 does not contain an even palindrome as a substring.
You are given 2 numbers a, b. Output the number of total-palindromic numbers which lie in the
range (a,b] i.e set { a+1, a+2, .... b }

Input
First line contains number of test cases T.
Each test case contains 2 lines.

First line contains the number a
Second line contains the number b


Output
Output T lines, each line containing an integer - the answer to the test case.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
99 ≤ a < b ≤ 10^18


Example
Input:
2
99
100
110
119

Output:
0
1

Explanation
In second test case the range is between 110 and 119 i.e the numbers 111,112,113,114,115,116,117,118,119.
Of these only 111 contains the odd palindromic substring 111 and even palindromic substring 11.
So the answer to this test-case is 1
