 

Problem description.
"Pandas Don't Cry" is a semi professional band. Recently, they bought a new tour bus, which they will use to travel from one city to another for their concerts. Unfortunately they don't have much funds left now. The Band's lead guitarist is worried as to how they will pay the tolls when they move from one city to the other, as they travel a lot. He doesn't have to worry about the fuel since that is taken care of by the band's sponsors. So he decides to take a route that will cost them the least on the basis of the toll that they have to pay when they move from one city to another. Now he thinks that he only has to minimise the toll. So he decides to choose a path that will cost them the least(toll-wise). But the next concert starts in T minutes!!! He soon realises that taking the path which would cost them the least toll may not be such a good idea as the band has to reach the destination city in less than or equal to T minutes, and the path through which they will have to pay the least may not take them to their destination in that time. He has no idea how to solve this problem. He asks you for help.

Given a starting city and a destination city, tell the minimum toll that the band will have to pay to go from the starting city to the destination city. 

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases.
For each of the t test cases, the first line contains the number of cities N and available time T.
The first city is the city at which the band starts, the last city is the their destination city.
After this line there are N lines with N numbers each, specifying for each city the travel time to the i-th city.
The table is terminated with an empty line.
The table of the tolls follows in the same format.
In other words, each entry in row i and column j denotes the time/toll incurred on moving from city i to city j. 


Output

For each test case, output a single line containing the minimum toll that the band will have to pay followed by the total travelling time.

 

Constraints

1 ≤ t ≤ 30
3 ≤ N ≤ 50
0 ≤ T ≤ 1000
