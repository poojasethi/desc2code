Let G(S) denote the sum of the elements of set S and F(n) be the sum of G(s) for all subsets of the set consisting of the first n natural numbers. 

For example, F(3) = (1) + (2) + (3) + (1 + 2) + (1 + 3) + (2 + 3) + (1 + 2 + 3) = 24.



Given n, calculate F(1) + F(2) + ... + F(n).


Input

The first line contains the number of test cases T ( ≤ 1000). Each of the next T lines contains an integer n. (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000000000).

Output

Output T lines, one corresponding to each test case. Since the answers can get very big, output the answer modulo 8388608
