In cricket tournament, the winner of a match is awarded with 3 points and the loser 0 points. In case of a tie, both teams are awarded with 1 point each.You had given number of wins for each team in the tournament, and the number of ties for each team in the tournament and your job is to calculate the maximum points a team in the tournament has.For example:-
there are 6 teams in a tournament and 

no. of wins of 1st team= 12
no. of wins of 2nd team= 45
no. of wins of 3rd team= 20
no. of wins of 4th team= 17
no. of wins of 5th team= 48
no. of wins of 6th team= 0
no. of ties of 1st team=48
no. of ties of 2nd team=10
no. of ties of 3rd team=53
no. of ties of 4th team=94
no. of ties of 5th team=0
no. of ties of 6th team=100
So team 2 has the most number of points, 145 (45*3+10*1)



Input
Input will begin with an integer T, the number of test cases.Each Test case starts with an Integer N,
the number of teams in the tournament. The next N lines containing no. of win for each team per line 
in order from 1 to N team which is followed by N lines containing no. of ties for each team per line
in order 1 to N team.
1 ≤ T ≤ 20 
1 ≤ N ≤ 50
0 ≤ no of wins or ties for a team ≤ 100


Output
For each test case, output a single line containing maximum points a team has in the tournament .
