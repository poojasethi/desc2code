 
The Chef was an exceptionally great student, but did not write any of his exams well, and used to fail a lot receiving zeros in a lot of problems. This caused the Chef to have a fascination towards zeros. 
 The Chef wanted to write a program to help him find the number to trailing zeros. Let there be a whole number N such that N! (N factorial) when written in base 10 (decimal notation) ends in P Zeroes. The chef wants to find the smallest N which produces P Trailing Zeroes.

Note: It is assured that N exists for values of P tested.

Input
The first line consists of T number of test cases. Then T lines follow each taking the input P.



Output
>Your program has to print the number N for each test case in T lines.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
0 ≤ P ≤ 10^9

 

Example
Input:
1
2

Output:
10
 

Explanation
Test case 1. 10!= 3628800 (Two trailing zeroes).
