Prashant is a professor at NIT Jalandhar. His student, Pankaj recently gave a test for n subjects. He scores Ai marks in the i^th subject. Now, Prashant does very strict marking and gives negative marks too.
Pankaj wants that his marks should be same in all the subjects. So, he goes to Prashant and asks for his help.

Prashant says that he can help Pankaj in the following way :


Pankaj can select any two subjects i and j (i≠j).Prashant will increment marks of i^th subject by 1 and decrement marks of the j^th subject by 1.

He can do the above step any number of times.

Now you have to help Pankaj find the maximum number of subjects in which he can achieve equal marks.

Input

The first line contains a single integer T, denoting the number of testcases. The descriptions of T test cases follow.

Each test case contains integer, n  the total number of subjects.The next line contains n space-separated integers the marks in n subjects.

Output
For each Test case, Output the maximum number of subjects in which he can achieve equal marks.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10.
1 ≤ n≤ 100000
-1000000000 ≤ Ai≤ 1000000000


Example
Input:
1
3
1 6 2

Output:
3

Explanation
Example case 1. Pankaj will 1st select subject 1 and 2 and now marks become : {2,5,2}.
Pankaj will then select subject 2 and 3 and now marks become : {2,4,3}.
Pankaj will then select subject 1 and 2 and now marks become : {3,3,3}.
