Harsh’s brother gifted him a big pack of Parle-G, but it’s too much for him. He doesn’t want to eat them all so to decide which out of them he will eat, he came up with an interesting way.
Harsh arranges n biscuits in a line, placing each piece vertically upright like dominoes. In the beginning, he simultaneously pushes some of the biscuits either to the left or to the right.  After each second, each domino that is falling to the left pushes the adjacent biscuit on the left. Similarly, the biscuits falling to the right push their adjacent biscuits standing on the right. When a vertical biscuit has biscuits falling on it from both sides, it stays still due to the balance of the forces. The figure shows one possible example of the process.

Finally in the end, Harsh will eat all those biscuits that are left standing.
Given the initial directions Harsh has pushed the biscuits, find the number of the biscuits he will eat.
Input
The first line contains a single integer n (1≤n≤400), the number of the biscuits in the line. The next line contains a character string of length n.  The i-th character of the string si is equal to
•	"L", if the i-th biscuit has been pushed to the left;
•	"R", if the i-th biscuit has been pushed to the right;
•	".", if the  i-th biscuit has not been pushed.
It is guaranteed that if si=sj="L" and i
Output
Output a single integer, the number of the biscuits that Harsh will eat.
