Rohan has decided to trade in Gold. But as he is just starting out, he can only buy one unit of gold and then sell it at a later date. This is unfair for Rohan. To make up for this restriction, Rohan is given the price of gold of N days into the future from today. Can you help Rohan maximize his profit?

Input
The First line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The First line consists of a single integer N which is the number of days. The following N lines will consist of the integer P[i] which is the price of gold on i'th day.


Output
For each test case output a single integer which is the maximum profit he can make.

Constraints

1≤ T ≤1000 
0≤ N ≤10^6 
0≤ P[i] ≤10^6
