Chef is very quick at finding remainders of integer division. Thus,to increase the difficulty, he is given three numbers X,Y and N,and asked to calculate the remainder of X^Y/N.


Note: Please look at the list of languages allowed for this problem.

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
The second line contains a single integer N denoting the divisor. Description of T cases follow.
Each line of the test case contains 2 space-separated integers X and Y respectively.


Output

For each test case, output a single line containing the remainder of (X^Y)/N.


Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10^6
1 ≤ X ≤ 10^6
1 ≤ Y,N ≤ 10

 

Example
Input:
3
3
5 2
2 5
3 3

Output:
1
2
0


Explanation
Example case 1. Here the value of N is 3, which remains constant for all test cases. The required output for the first test case would be the remainder of 5^2/3
i.e. 25%3i.e. 1.
