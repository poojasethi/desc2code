Four Intergers are encoded in a special manner. A encoded integer of any integer in a series is a difference between the sum of integers at the right of that interger and the sum of integers at the left of that integer.
Suppose 1 2 3 4 are four integers in a series then 1 will be encoded as (2+3+4), 2 will be encoded as (3+4-1), 3 will be encoded as (4-(1+2)) and 4 will be encoded as (-(1+2+3)). 
So series of encoded integers is 9 6 1 -6


Your job is to find the original series of intergers from a given series of encoded integers

Input

Input is a single line containing the numnber of test cases T not more than 10. First line of each test case consists of four integers seperated by a space. 

Output
 For each test, output a series of original integers seperated by a space.

Example

Input:
2
9 6 1 -6
37 12 -22 -44

Output:
1 2 3 4
10 15 19 3
