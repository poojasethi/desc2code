Problem description
You are participating in The Quick-Math Quiz 2015 and, fortunately enough, have managed to qualify for the final round. But the final round ain't a piece of cake. The quiz master has revealed the final problem which reads :

You are given an array of integers of size N and an integer K.
Then you are asked Q number of questions.
Each question has two integers S and X.
You need to tell if the sum of any S consecutive subarrays of size K sum up to X or not.

The contestant who answers first, wins.

Input
The first line of the input contains two integers N and K denoting the size of array and size of each subarray respectively.The next line contains N spaced integers representing the array.The next line contains an integer Q representing the number of questions.Q lines follow.Each question has two spaced integers S and X representing the number of consecutive subarrays and the sum of consecutive subarrays.

Output
For each question, print "YES" or "NO" (without the quotations) accordingly to the question.

Constraints

1 ≤ S+K-1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ Q ≤ 10^3
1 ≤ Value of an integer in array ≤ 100


Example
Input:
5 2
1 2 3 4 5
41 52 123 143 21

Output:
YES
YESNOYES
Explanation
Example case 1. (2 + 3) = 5 by considering 1 subarray starting from 2^nd position.Example case 2. (2 + 3) + (3 + 4) = 12 by considering 2 subarrays with the first subarray starting from 2^nd position.Example case 3. The sum any three consectuive subarrays of size 2 is not equal to 14 as the only two possibilities are 15 and 21 Example case 4. (2 + 3) + (3 + 4) + (4 + 5) = 12 by considering 3 subarrays with the first subarray starting from 2^nd position.
