Romeo and Juliet are sending messages to each other. But to protect them from prying eyes, they have come up with a clever scheme to encrypt their messages. They have assigned a number to every possible combination of alphabets! It goes as follows: 
1 = A
2 = B
.
.
.
26 = Z
27 = AA
28 = AB
.
.
.
702 = ZZ
703 = AAA and so on.
Now you have to decrypt their message.

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follow:
Each test case contains a single integer N denoting the coded word.

Output
For each test case, output a single string(upper case) which is the decoded word.

Constraints
Should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have. Format it like:

1 <= T <= 1000
1 <= N <= 10^18


Example
Input:
5
6
28
221629
4606000382677
62977

Output:
F
AB
LOVE
VALENTINE
