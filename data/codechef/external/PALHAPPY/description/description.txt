 
Arora is a content person because, his name can be spelt the same, when seen from both left and right sides, ie. a palindrome. Seeing this, his friend, gagan, also wanted to have something unique about his name. So, he finds out, that by changing a single letter of his name(gaga'g'), his name also becomes a palindrome.
