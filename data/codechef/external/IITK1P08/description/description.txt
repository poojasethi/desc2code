You are a bird shooting enthusiast. You are standing on position 0 and a flock of birds (assume infinitely many birds) is flying away from you at 1m/s.
The flock of birds is initially at 1m away from you.


Your rating is (P, N) and your time lag is (T, R). This means the following.


If P is your precision rating : At every turn, beginning when the birds are at 1m position, you take a shot at one of the birds in the flock.
Suppose at this turn, if the flock of birds is Xm away from you, then probability that shot is successful is 1 ⁄ X^P.


N is your range : You can only shoot at the flock of birds if it is at a distance less than or equal to N.


T is your reload time : After every shot, you reload your gun, and that takes time T. The next time you shoot, thus the flock of birds is T more meters away than it initially was.


R is your rejoicing time :D : If you are successful in shooting a bird, you rejoice your success and spend an extra amount of time R in reloading
(taking a total of T + R time before the next shot).



Assume that you have infinitely many bullets.


Given N, P, T, and R. Find the expected number of birds you will shoot down!


Input

A single line containing space separated 4 numbers N, P, T, and R, in that order. P is a real number while others are positive integers.

Output

A single line containing the expected number of birds you will shoot down. The output should be correct to within 10^(-6) of the actual answer.


Constraints

 P is a real number, 1 < P < 100 
 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^18 
 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^5 
 1 ≤ R ≤ 10^5 
 Further, ln(N) < 14 (P - 1) 


Example
Input:
10 2 3 4

Output:
1.015625
