drawft.com/android  is hiring freshers. As they are giving opportunity to freshers, the number of applicants were too high and they don't have time to conduct personal interview for each candidate. Hence, they thought of conducting an elimination round.
Help Bob to get Placed into the job. He can prove himself when he attends Personal Interview but the thing is how to cross the elimination round.
In Elimination round, they divided entire people into different groups of varying sizes. Only one candidate from each groups will have a chance to attend interview.
How they select that candidate is ..
Consider there are N people in a group circularly (say person1 to personN),
they give a sword to person1.
now, showing the sword person1 asks person2 to go back home and passes it to person3 and the same process repeats until only one person left and that person will get a chance to attend interview. Help Bob to be that person in his group.
