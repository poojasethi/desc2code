Chef recently bought an online catering website. To increase his sales he decides to organize a lottery system, where you get one digit for every item you buy. A person's lottery number is formed by taking all the digits they received, in the order in which they were received.
For example, if a person buys items A, B and C in that order, and gets digits 1, 5, and 7 respectively for these items, then that person's lottery number is 157.
Now, Chef is an intelligent guy, so he decides that the lottery number wins if it is a palindrome. But he finds that there are a lot of palindromes so a lot of people win the lottery. He decides that he'll change the rule a little.
Under the new rules, for a lottery number of length N, the last K digits together should form a prime number, and the remaining N-K digits together should form a palindrome.
Chef wants to find out how many winning lottery numbers exist for a given value of N and K.

Input
The first line contains T, the number of test cases. It is followed by T lines, each of which contains 2 integers, N and K, separated by a space.

Output
For each test case, output the possible number of tickets (as described above) modulo 1000000007

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
2 ≤ N ≤ 10^18
1 ≤ K ≤ 9
K < N


Example
Input:
2
2 1
4 2

Output:
36
225


Explanation
Example case 1.
K is 1. There are 4 possible prime numbers of 1 digit: [2, 3, 5, 7]. N-K is 1. There are 9 possible palindromes: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] (numbers of length 1 are trivially palindromes). The total number of possibilities is 9 * 4 = 36. 36 % 1000000007 = 36.
Example case 2.
K is 2. There are 25 possible prime numbers of upto 2 digits [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, ...]. N-K is 2. There are 9 possible palindromes of 2 digits: [11, 22, 33, ...]. The total number of possibilities is 25 * 9 = 225. 225 % 1000000007 = 225.
