 
The number of submissions of CodeChef from Students of Graphic Era University had been growing since the day the CodeChef campus chapter, GEU_Coders had been formed here. This rise in user submissions alerted the staff members at CodeChef. They started to track user activities of students from Graphic Era University. They noted a particular pattern in growth of submissions. Every day starting from 15^th Feb, 2015 (which is the date when GEU_Coders started) they took note of the number of user submission from students of Graphic Era University. They observed that the number of submissions was growing in the following manner:
1 2 7 20 61...
CodeChef was hosting a major contest where it was expecting a huge traffic, the contest is scheduled N days from the day GEU_Coders started. They need to take preparation to manage the traffic on that day. Assuming that the sequence will continue growing in the same manner as that in the present, they would like to know how many user submissions would be there from the students of Graphic Era University on the N^th day.
Note: You are required to submit an iterative solution and not a recursive one.

Constraints
Should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have. Format it like:

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 20
