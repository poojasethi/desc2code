You have an unbiased coin which you want to keep tossing until you get N consecutive heads. You've tossed the coin M times and surprisingly, all tosses resulted in heads. What is the expected number of additional tosses needed until you get N consecutive heads?
Input: The first line contains the number of cases T. Each of the next T lines contains two numbers N and M.
Output: Output T lines containing the answer for the corresponding test case. Print the answer rounded to exactly 2 decimal places.
Sample Input: 4 2 0 2 1 3 3 3 2
Sample Output: 6.00 4.00 0.00 8.00
Sample Explanations: If N = 2 and M = 0, you need to keep tossing the coin until you get 2 consecutive heads. It is not hard to show that on average, 6 coin tosses are needed.
If N = 2 and M = 1, you need 2 consecutive heads and have already have 1. You need to toss once more no matter what. In that first toss, if you get heads, you are done. Otherwise, you need to start over, as the consecutive counter resets, and you need to keep tossing the coin until you get N=2 consecutive heads. The expected number of coin tosses is thus 1 + (0.5 * 0 + 0.5 * 6) = 4.0
 If N = 3 and M = 3, you already have got 3 heads, so you do not need any more tosses.
