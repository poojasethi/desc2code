Problem

			There are N rectangular towers in a certain two-dimensional landscape. Each tower has a height given by hi, i∈[1,N] . If you join K adjacent towers, they will form a solid rectangle of area K ✕ min(hi,hi+1,......hi+k+1).

            Given N towerss, find the greatest such solid area formed by consecutive towers.

Input

			The first line contains N, the number of towers altogether.
            The second line contains N space-separated integers, each representing the height of a tower.

Output

			One integer representing the maximum area of rectangle formed.

Constraints


					1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5




					1 ≤ hi  ≤ 10^6
