  __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __

7|__|__|__|__|__|__|__|__|
6|__|__|__|__|__|__|__|__|
5|__|__|__|__|__|__|__|__|

     1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8 


Input

The first line consists of the number of test cases (within 1 and 20) followed by a blank line. The input consists of the position (indices as 2-digit integer as denoted on the board) of the pieces in the following order:

8 White Pawns
2 White Rooks
2 White Knights
2 White Bishops
1 White Queen
1 White King
8 Black Pawns
2 Black Rooks
2 Black Knights
2 Black Bishops
1 Black Queen
1 Black King

Total 32 inputs for a single test case.

A zero will be provided as an input if the corresponding piece is absent on the board. Finally, there is a blank line between corresponding test-case input. Consider that the input is error-free also consider that no piece is in attack by any other piece apart from the BLACK king.

You just have to print the result of the question, "Is the black king in Checkmate condition?" in "yes" or "no" for each input on separate line.
