There are two right angle triangles with same base and different height.The hypotenuse of the two triangles are intersecting each other. The complete figure is such that the perpendicular of two triangles start from the two end points of their same base.

Your job is to write a program to calculate the length of perpendicular drawn from the intersection point of two hypotenuse to the base.


Input
Input is a single line  containing a number of test cases T not more than 10 and first line of each test case contains the length of perpendicular of first triangle and second line of each test case contains the length of prepdicular of second triangle. The length of base is not given as a input. All the inputs are positive integer values.


Output
For each test case output is a single line containing the lenth of perpendicular drawn from the intersection point of two hypotenuse to the base.
