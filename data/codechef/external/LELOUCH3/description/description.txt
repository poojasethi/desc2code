Problem Statement:
At Ashford academy, mathematics instructor comes up with an easy number problem for the test.
Finding out the sum of squares of proper factors of a given number other than 1. Now you would think thats easy, but for Nunnally (She is Lelouch's sister if you were wondering) its not.
You have to write a program for her to compute the sum of squares 'S' of proper factors of a number 'n'.
Help Nunnally pass the test.

Input:
First line contains the number of test  cases 'T' followed by T lines containing a test case each.

Ouput:
In one line output S mod 1000000007 for every test case.

Constraint:
0 <= n <= 10^8
1 <= t <= 10^2
time = 1 sec

Example:
Input:
5
3
8
9
6
10

Output:
0
20
9
13
29
