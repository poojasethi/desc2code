Alice went to see the sage to find out if he is real or not. Sage asked her a question.How many minimum number of strings P, does she need to make a string (S). He gave her infinite number of strings of P. He told her she can concatenate any number of strings of P. Sage to make her life simple, told her that she can remove any unnecessary characters from the concatenated string. Alice needs your help in finding out the answer. Can you help Alice in finding the truthfulness of the Sage. If you cannot make string S, then Sage asked her to print “-1”.
