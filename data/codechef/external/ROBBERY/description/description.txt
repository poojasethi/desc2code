 
There were two robbers Kali and Vikrant who came across a hidden cave. When they went inside ,they saw a stack of gold plates kept there. Each plate has a money value written on it which he will get when he sells them. They decided to play a game .
In each turn the player can take 1,2 or 3 gold plates from the top. Both the players play optimally but Kali starts first. Now you have to tell what is the maximum money Kali will get when he sells his gold plates.
See Sample I/O for clarifications 

Input
First line is T , the number of testcases Then 2T lines follow , 2 lines for each testcase.
The first line contains N , the number of gold plates in the stack
Second line consists of N integers denoting the money value of plates 
Note: The first element denotes top of the stack and the last element the bottom of thestack.

Output
For each test case, output the answer which is the maximum money value Kali can get on selling his plates.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 5
1 ≤ N ≤ 100000
1 ≤ Money Value on a plate ≤ 1000000000


Example
Input:
2
3
1 2 3
4
1 1 3 4
Output:
6
5
 

Explanation
Case 2.
Kali takes the plates with values 1,1,3 and Vikrant takes the plate with value 4 . So Kali can get maximum money value = 1+1+3 =5.
