 
Chella, a 5 year old kid, recently learnt the numbers from 0 to 9, and spends all his time trying to write larger numbers. One day he wrote a number on a paper, and turned it upside down i.e. inverted it. He was surprised and amazed  that the writing he did on the paper still made sense. So, now he has created a game for himself, where he writes numbers and looks at them upside down to see if it still is valid. Can you help Chella in this game..??
 

Input
 t    (no. of  testcases) 
 n   (number which is to be found valid while being viewed upside down)

Constraints
 1<= t  <= 1000
 1<= n <= 10^50

Output
yes If the number is valid , followed by the new number(after inverting) in the next line.
 no. otherwise

Example
Input:

2

1234567

1809610

Output:

no

yes

0196081
