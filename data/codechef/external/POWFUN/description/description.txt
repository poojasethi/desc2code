 
F(x)=Sum of powers of primes in prime factorization of x
Given p and q,
Calculate ∑f(x) for x in range(p,q).

For Ex : - F(18) =3
18 is written as 2^1 * 3^2, so powers are 1 and 2, Hence, F(18) = 1+2 = 3. 

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of   T test cases follows.
The first line contains 2 space-separated integers p and q. 

 

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing summation of F(x) for all x in range(p,q)

 

Constraints

p ≤ q
1 ≤ p,q ≤ 10^6
T ≤ 10^6
