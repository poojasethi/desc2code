Problem Description:


"For them it's a choice between German bullets and ours, but there's another way; a way of courage, a way of love of the Motherland. We must publish the army newspaper again, we must tell magnificent stories, we must make them believe in a victory. We must give them hope."
             -Danilov

In war,we find water scarcity everywhere all over the Europe.
 German Major Erwin König starts his work for using the ground water for irrigation. He finds the undergroud water flowing
along the  line y = x. He wants the project to be useful for the given  'N'  surrounding villages. Hence he needs to find a place along the water flow
such that the sum of the distance from 'N' surrounding villages to that place is minimum. Could you help him to find such a place? 
 

Input
First the line contains an integer T   denotes the  no of test cases

Each test-case starts with an integer N denotes no of villages / no of coordinates

The next   N lines contain coordinates x and y of the village


 

Output
For each test cases print the required coordinate in the form  x y rounded to 6 decimal places

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ n ≤ 2000
-10000 ≤ x,y ≤ 10000

 

Example
Input:
1
2
0 1
2 1

Output:
1.000000 1.000000
 

Explanation
Example case 1. 
The project should be started at (1.000000,1.000000) since the sum of the distance from this to all the villages is 2 (1 + 1).you cannot find any other coordinate along the water flow whose sum of distances is less than 2
