Problem description.
The Pragyan Bot Contest is to design a bot to do the following task. You are given an initial configuration of board of M rows and N columns and a target board of M rows and N columns, where each tile is either Blue or Red.
Blue is denoted as '1' and Red is denoted as '0'. Your task is to make the initial configuration on the board to look like the target board. The bot can do one of the following functions in each step : 

Select a column Ci. For each tile in that column change the blue color tiles to red and vice-versa. It takes one time unit to do this.
Select any two rows and swap them. This operation takes zero time units 


Find the minimum number of time units taken to change the board to the given configuration.

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers M and N. Then 2 lines follows where the first line contains M space-separated strings of 0's and 1's each of length N where the strings represents the configuration of M rows of the initial board. Then the next line contains M space-separated strings of 0's and 1's each of length N where the strings represents the configuration of M rows of the target board


Output

For each test case, output a single line containing the minimum time taken to match the boards. If it is not possible for the bot to match them, then output -1.


Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 150
1 ≤ M ≤ 150
1 ≤ N ≤ 50

 

Example
Input:
1
2 3
110 001
000 111

Output:
1

Explanation
For the first test case the robot can switch the 3rd column of the initial board and match it with the final board.
