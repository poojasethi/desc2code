Problem statement
Henry, a graduate research assistant, is doing research on the properties of Fibonacci numbers. He is overloaded with work from his Professor and could make
use of some automation. He requests you to write a program which would tell him whether or not each number from the sample data, which he provides, is a Fibonacci
number of not. Write the program for him.

NOTE: Fibonacci numbers are numbers of the sequence which follows the recursive formula An = An-1+An-2 where A1 = 0 and A2 = 1 (initial conditions).


Input
The first line contains T the number of test cases.
The T lines follow with each line containing a single integer F.


Output
For each test case, ie., for each number F, display whether or not the number is a Fibonacci number. Each test case output should occupy its own line.
Print "YES" if it is a Fibonacci number else print "NO" (Both without quotes).


Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 100000
0 ≤ F < 2^64


Sample Input
2
34
1233


Sample Output
YESNO


Explanation

34 is the 10^th Fibonacci number.
1233 is not a Fibonacci number.
