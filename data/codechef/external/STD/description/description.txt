 
In Hogwarts this year, darkness will prevail.
Harry Potter, through his mental connection with Voldemort, has found out that Malfoy will be killing Dumbledore. Harry will do anything to save him.
Hermione has promised to go in the future every day, using her time turner (only, she can’t change the future herself) and tell him the exact time when malfoy has the opportunity to kill Dumbledore, starting from tomorrow (Ron bets it’s the 13th day, but who believes Ron?!)
Hermione visits each day, and finds that the time when Dumbledore can be killed is peculiar. She will make a table for each day, starting from 00:00 hours at night. She can figure the exact time by calculating the product of at least three ‘stand numbers’ mentioned on the stairs of the quidditch playground stands. Ron points out that each of these is a Prime number and that they only increase each day (Ron can be a game changer sometimes!!). 
Filch knows their plan but will never tell them that none of the numbers on a single day are ever the same.
Help harry and Hermione figure out the time, if Dumbledore is to be murdered on the Nth day, starting tomorrow.
