Now she Challenged chef to find a pair of numbers in the list with maximum XOR. Since chef is busy, he is asking for your help. 

Input
The first line of the input has a single integer T denoting the test cases. Each test case has a single number 'n'.

Output
You have to print the maximum XOR achievable using any pair of numbers between 0 and n(both inclusive).

Constraints

1 <= n <= 10^9

1 <= T <= 10^5



Example
Input:

1
1
