Problem description
NIT Durgapur sports club is organising a boxing tournament. There are N boxers(numbered from 1 to N) and M matches will be played between them.Each player will play against some/all of the players. Also, every player has their market value. Now Mr Silol is a bookie who does not want this tournament to happen. So he decides to bribe each and every player by paying them the amount corresponding to the sum of the market value of all the players, he will be playing against and who are still in the tournament. When a player walks out, all his matches are cancelled. So in order to cancel the tournament all matches should be cancelled. Your task is to help Mr Silol in finding out the minimum amount he has to spend so that the tournament is cancelled successfully.NOTE: Value of each player is between 1 and 100(both inclusive).

Input
The first line of input contains T, the number of test cases. Each test case consist of multiple lines.First line contains two integers N and M. Next line contains N space seperated integers, market value of N players. Then M lines to follow , each of which contains two integers X and Y between whom the matches will be played.

Output
For each test case,output a single line containing the minimum amount Mr Silol has to pay.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 1000
1 ≤ M ≤ 1000
1 ≤ X,Y ≤ N


Example
Input:
1
4 3
30 10 20 40
2 4
3 2
1 3

Output:
40

Explanation
One of the optimal sequence is:1.First bribe player 1,cost is 20.2.Than bribe player 3,cost is 10.3.Than bribe player 4,cost is again 10.4.At last,bribe player 2,cost is 0.
Therefore,total cost is 40 which is minimum.
