Andromeda has a deep interest in stars, galaxies and the universe since childhood. She has taken several picture of the night sky and based on that, she has noted down the co-ordinates of all the stars in 3D space (the coordinate values are in light years). The coordinates of two stars may not be distinct due to human error. She considers two stars to be in same galaxy if euclidiean distance between them is atmost d light years. Three stars A, B, C  such that euclidiean distance between A and B is less than or equal to d and euclidiean distance between B and C is less than or equal to d, then they all will be in same galaxy even if euclidiean distance between A and C is greater than d.
Andromeda wants to know the number of galaxies and for that she needs your help. You are given coordinates of N stars and the value of d. You have to tell her the number of galaxies.
 

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers N and d.
The next N line contains 3 space-separated xi, yi, zi integers denoting the co-ordinates of the stars 

 

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing total number of galaxies.

 

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 100
0 ≤ d ≤ 10^9
-10^8 ≤ xi, yi, zi ≤ 10^8 (1 ≤ i ≤ N)
