This time it was WonderKingâ€™s opportunity to challenge WonderMath, although it is hard to give him a
challenge, king gave a challenge. It is like follows. 
King gives a number that is sum of most 10 consecutive numbers and least
2 consecutive numbers. WonderMath has to find those consecutive numbers which
has to add.
As an Example :
We can write 18 as the sum of consecutive as follow,
18 = 5 + 6 + 7
18 = 3 + 4 + 5 + 6
In this challenge you have to consider most consecutive numbers,
so the answer will be 3,4,5,6.
Your program must help WonderMath to find those consecutives.

Input
The first line contains the number of cases (< 100), and then in each
new line the number ( < 10,000)you have to find consecutives.


Output

The consecutive numbers that sums up to produce the number given in
the input file, each number separated by a space.
