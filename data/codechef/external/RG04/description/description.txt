As engineering colleges are proliferating without any check, so a law has been passed stating that the number of colleges in any state should be limited 

to a single digit. So a software engg. was called to develop some code which takes number of colleges as input and display the single digit number of 

required colleges as output for each state.

Input
Each line of input consists of a number of colleges (maximum 5 digits) to be tested. when 0 is encountered as input program terminates


Output
Ouput consists of a single digit number for each input number fed to that software.
