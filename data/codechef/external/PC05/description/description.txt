Given a range of numbers (BOTH INCLUSIVE), print the number of numbers, sum of whose digits is a prime number.
 Note: 1 is NOT considered to be a prime number.


Input
First line contains the number of test cases T.
Each test case consists of two lines, each line containing one integer. First integer L gives the beginning of the range of values and the second integer U gives the end of range.


Output
One integer in a new line which gives the number of numbers that satisfy the given condition.


Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ L ≤ U ≤ 10,000
