Given an array a[1..n] with n positive integers. You can select any 3 different indices i, j, k and sum up the values a[i], a[j], a[k]. You need to output the maximum sum you can make by selecting some i, j, k.

Input
The first line contains an integer T indicating the number of test cases.
For each test case, the first line contains n indicating the size of array a. 
Second line of each test case contains n space separated integers representing the array a. 

Output
Output T lines in total. Each line starts with "Case #: " and followed by the maximum sum of 3 values. Here "#" is the number of the test case starting from 1.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 30
3 ≤ n ≤ 100
1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10000


Example
Input:
2
4
1 2 3 4
4
1 2 1 1

Output:
Case 1: 9
Case 2: 4


Explanation
Test Case 1:
You can select 2, 3, 4 and get the sum 2+3+4 = 9.
Test Case 2:
You can select 2, 1, 1 and get the sum 2+1+1 = 4.
