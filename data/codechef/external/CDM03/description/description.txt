 
Chef was doing the work of his math class about three days but he is tired of make operations a lot and he should deliver his task tomorrow. His math’s teacher gives two numbers a and b. The problem consist in find the last digit of the potency of base a and index b. Help Chef with his problem. You are given two integer numbers: the base a  and the index b . a and b both are not 0. You have to find the last digit of a^b.
 

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows:
For each test case will appear a and b separated by space.

 

Output
For each test case output an integer per line representing the result.

 

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 30
1 ≤ a ≤ 20
1 ≤ b ≤ 2000

 

Example
Input:
2
3 10
6 2

Output:
9
6
 

Explanation
Example case 1. 3^10 = 59049 so last digit is 9.Similarly in case 2 6^2 = 36 so 6
