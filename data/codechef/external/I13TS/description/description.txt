Two good friends M.H. and S.K.M. like to play with digits....
One fine morning another friend A.D. gave them a huge stream of digits and asked some rather 'simple' questions. 
The two good friends M.H. and S.K.M. scrathed their heads and could not come up with an efficient solution.Can you help them?

The digit stream presented was 0123456789101112131415161718.........

A.D.'s rather simple questions went like this: he gave q the number of questions he would ask and then asked those questions as
what is the 100 th digit in the sequence?
what is the 112322th digit in the sequence? and so on...



Formally speaking,
You will be given q queries and each query will be a positive integer which denotes the position(starting with 0) who's digit you are required to find.

Input format:

Input starts with q the number of queries.Each query is presented in a new line.
Output format:

The digit in the required position in the above stream in a new line.
Constraints:
1<=q<=10^6
and each query will be a positive integer

Sample input:

4
0
3
10
11
Sample Output:

0
3
1
0
