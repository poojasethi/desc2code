 
Tanya recently learned about switch sequences, and the concept of "Good Switch Sequence" or GSS and loved it. A switch is a device, which can be either 'On' or 'Off' and can be toggled as we require. A "Good Switch Sequence"/GSS is one where all the "Off" switches appear before the "On" switches in the sequence, if they are present
Now she got a switch sequence from her friend and decided to convert it to a GSS. At a particular instant she can toggle any one switch in the sequence from On to Off or vice versa. You need to tell her the minimum number of toggles she needs to do to achieve the goal of GSS.
 

Input
The first line contains T, the number of Test Cases. T lines follow.
Each Line of test case consists of a string S -consisting of letters 'O' and 'N' only , representing the given Switch Sequence. Character 'O' at an index i represents that the i'th switch is OFF. Character 'N' at an index i represents that the i'th switch is ON .

Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the answer.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 200
1 ≤ |S| ≤ 100

 

Example
Input:
3
ONONO
OOONNNNN
NNNNOOO

Output:
2
0
3
 

Explanation
Example case 1.There are many ways to get a GSS in two toggles. For example: Toggle the second and the fourth 'N's to get a GSS.

Example case 2.There is no need to toggle any switch as the given sequence is already a GSS.
