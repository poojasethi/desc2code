Problem description.
Jojo is so good at multiplying that she can multiply two 15-digits integers within 5 seconds. After practicing for years, she decided to approach the Limca Book of Records. As a jury member you are given the task to decide if she is eligible enough for holding the record. But before you test her, you should know the result of multiplication of numbers so that you can verify them with her answers.As an computer science literate, create a program that can calculate the multiplication of two numbers efficiently.

Input

Each sub-task contains just two integers A , B in two separate lines.

There will be a total of 10 sub-tasks.

Output

For each sub-task, output a single line containing the result of multiplication of both the integers.


Constraints
All the subtask contains different numbers.

1 ≤  A , B  ≤ 10^15

 

Example
Input:
111111
111111

Output:
12345654321

 

Explanation
Self-explanatory.
