Problem Statement
John defines a wavy sequence "a" as a sequence of N integers such that a[0] < a[1] > a[2] < a[3] > a[4] ... and so on.
Also,  he defines the value of a sequence as sum of |a[i] - a[i - 1]| for all 0 < i < N.

Now, any sequence that is wavy and has maximum value amongst all its permutations becomes the favourite of John. Given an integer N, can you print the lexicographically minimum permutation of length N(containing numbers from 1 to N) that is John's favourite?

Note : "1" is lexicographically smaller than "2".


Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer N.

Output
For each test case, output a single line containing N+1 integers, the first being the value of the required permutation, followed by the permutation itself.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 10
0 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
