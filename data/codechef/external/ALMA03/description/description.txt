 
We all know that our friend Bheem likes gcd of numbers very much. One day Kaalia challenged him with a new problem with gcd. He gave Bheem N numbers and asked to divide the given set of numbers into some disjoint subsequences. Two numbers a and b belong to same subsequence if  gcd(a,b)>1. Value of each subsequence is the largest number in that subsequence. He challenged Bheem to find the product of values of all subsequences.
Help Bheem win this challenge.

Note: if gcd(a,b) >1, gcd (b,c) >1 then a,b,c will be in same subsequence even if gcd(a,c) = 1.

 

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of elements in the set.
 The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN elements in the set. 

 

Output

For each test case output a single number, the answer to given problem modulo 1000000007, in a separate line.
