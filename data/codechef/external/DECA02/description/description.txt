Problem Description
Alex from mars is planning to attack the Earth. He has created his army with some divisions. Each division is headed by a leader. Each division has some soldiers.
When the leaders went to Alex to show the army formation, he was unhappy with the number of soldiers in each division. He then decided to increase or decrease
the count of soldiers in each division. "m" represents the initial count in the division, "n" represents the count decided by Alex.
Only two operations are allowed:
1. A soldier can be removed from the division, i.e. if there are x soldiers than after operation there will be (x-1) soldiers .
2. The current number of soldiers can be doubled, i.e. if there are x soldiers than x more soldiers can be added to hav 2x soldiers.
Each operation cost one. 
You have to find the minimum number of operations needed to convert "m" soldiers to "n" soldiers. See the explaination for more clarification.

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.Each test case consists of one line containing two space separated integers: m and n


Output
For each test case output the minimum number of operations needed. 

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ m,n ≤ 10^9

 

Example
Input:
3
8 16
8 5
1 3
Output:
1
3
3

Explanation
case 1 :8 can be doubled to 16. so only one operation.
case 2: 3 operations needed :
	8->7->6->5. 3 operations.
