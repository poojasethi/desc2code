 The Wonderking in Wonderland had a great
friend called Wondermath a professor in mathematics.
The king and the professor shared everything, they were same age,
married same day, have same number of children etc. To represent
this friendship  professor Wondermath introduced Amicable numbers,
a pair who is friends like him and king.
 Amicable numbers are a pair of numbers with the following property: the sum of all of the proper
divisors of the first number (not including itself) exactly equals
the second number while the sum of all of the proper divisors of the
second number (not including itself) likewise equals the first number. 
The set of 220 and 284 was the first known set of amicable numbers.
Pythagoras discovered the relationship and coined the term amicable
because he considered the numbers to be a symbol of friendship. 
For example:

For example let's show that  220 & 284 are amicable numbers:
First we find the proper divisors of 220:

1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, 110 

If you add up all of these numbers you will see that they sum to 284.


Now find the proper divisors of 284:


1, 2, 4, 71, 142

These sum to 220, and therefore 220 & 284 are amicable numbers.
To satisfy his friend Wonderking, professor wants to find many Amicable numbers before the tea time tomorrow. You must develop a program that declares a number is amicable or not in order to help professor WonderMath.



Input
The first line of the input file contains the number cases (<10) followed by set of numbers ( < 100,000,000) one in each new line which you have to declare amicable or not.

Output
If the number is not an amicable number it should print no, if it is an amicable number it should print yes and the amicable number of it. 

Example
Input:
4
1184
2620
3550
5020 


Output:
Yes, amicable with 1210
Yes, amicable with 2924
No
Yes, amicable with 5564
