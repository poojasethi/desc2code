A prisoner from the Central Jail has just escaped in the late night, the city has been put on high alert. Special Security forces are chasing him. To catch him as soon as possible they seek the help of CAI.

You are an agent at Central Agency of Investigation a.k.a CAI, your boss has assigned you a task of tracking a person who has just escaped the prison, with the help of the advanced satellite imaging of the institute.
 

The satellite sends you the real time coordinates of the prisoner as well as that of the city. You figured out that the city is a straight line divided into N segments. It is also known that for a pair of segment, they either have no common points or all points of one segment belong to the second segment. (Here points are the houses belonging to segment)


The satellite gives you M changing positions of the prisoner. For each position, your task is to report the security forces of the segment of minimum length, to which the prisoner belongs.


Input
The first line consists of an integer N, that is the number of segments The Next N lines consists of integers xi and yi that are the coordinates of the endpoints of the segment. All segments are distinct. The next M lines contains an integer cj, that is the number of changing positions.cj.


Output
For each position output the number of the corresponding segment on a single line, if the point doesn’t belong to any segment, print “-1”.

 Note: The segments are ordered from 1 to N.


Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ xi < yi ≤ 10^9 
1 ≤ M ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ cj ≤ 10^9
