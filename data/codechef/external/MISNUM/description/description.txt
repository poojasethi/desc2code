 
Shweta loved marking numbers. One day she was idle and decided to mark numbers in the following way

She decided to pick up all the numbers starting from 2 till 10^9 and for each number, she marked all its mulitples, including itself.
In the process, if she arrived at a number already marked, she would mark it again.

 
She then decided to make things more interesting. She threw away all the numbers that were marked exactly twice.
Given queries of a range of numbers, your task is to tell the number of missing numbers in that range (inclusive).

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer Q denoting the number of queries. The description of Q queries follows.
Each query contains two integers L and R denoting the range of query.
 

Output
For each query Q print in a new line the inclusive count of missing numbers in that range.
 

Constraints
Should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have. Format it like:

1 ≤ Q ≤ 10^6
1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ 10^9

 

Example
Input:
1
100 200

Output:
2
 

Explanation
In the sample test case there are two missing numbers in the range [100 , 200].
