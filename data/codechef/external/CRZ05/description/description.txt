After summer holidays,students of JNTUK-VZM are incurious during classes.
So their professor decided to make them play a game in order to motivate them
towards their academics.So the professor called two sets(equal number) of
same height (heights in one set are repeated in other set).He asked one
set of students to stand randomly and the other set to stand in the ascending
order of their heights opposite to each other.Professor asked students of
same height to exchange their positions.The motto of the game is to write a
program to calculate how many times the students of both sets meet.
