 
Given a set of N distinct numbers, you need to find the length of the longest monotone increasing subsequence.
A monotone increasing subsequence is a subset of numbers which are strictly increasing from left to right. However the numbers need not to be adjacent in the original set or the longest subsequence may/may not be unique.
For example : Given a sequence 1,2,9,4,7,3,11,8,14,6 , the longest monotone subsequence will be 1,2,4,7,11,14.

 

Input
The first line of input gives the number of cases, N.
N test cases follow. For each test case there will be two lines – the first one representing the length of the sequence & second one representing the sequence itself.



 

Output
For each test case, output one line containing the length of  the longest monotone subsequence for that test case..
 

Constraints

1 ≤ Length ≤ 20
1 ≤ N ≤ 10
