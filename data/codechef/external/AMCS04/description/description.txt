Consider the set of non negative integer values of X which satisfy the equation A^X = C (mod M), given that A and M are coprime. Find the sum of the least K values in this set. Print the answer modulo 10^9 + 7. If the number of terms in this sequence is less than K, output 0. 

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
The next T lines contains four space separated integers each A, C, M, K.

Output
For each test case print the answer in a separate line

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10^2
1 ≤ A ≤ 10^5
0 ≤ C < M
1 ≤ M ≤ 10^8
1 ≤ K ≤ 10^8
