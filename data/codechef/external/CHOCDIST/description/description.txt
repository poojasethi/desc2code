IIT Kharagpur's Cultural Fest Spring Fest is going on. Many students have come to attend this fest. Chef Arka from Arkland has also set up a stall. We all know that 
Arka's choclates are so delicious. But he could bring only N choclates. Currently there are K students at Arka's stall. Arka doesn't want to disappoint anybody so he 
will try to distribute choclates uniformly. Also he is a very kind person, so he will distribute all the choclates he has. Every one is excited to know maximum number 
of choclate that one can get.

Input
First line contains T (number of test cases). T lines follow, each line consisting of two integers N and K.

Output
For each test case print one line containg maximum number of choclate that a student can get.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
1 ≤  N, K  ≤ 1000
