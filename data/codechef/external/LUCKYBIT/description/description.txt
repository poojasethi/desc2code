 
Lucky has an array of N elements [a1, a2, a3, ....,an]. Bunny decided to play a game with the array. So he gave another array which have N elements [b1, b2, b3, ...., bn] and ask her to find the minimum number of bits required to change ai to bi. Let's consider ai = 4 and bi = 3 binary values of 4 and 3 are 100 and 011, we need 3 bits to change 4 to 3.

She needs your help to solve this problem.
 

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer N denotes number of elements in the arrays.
For next N lines, each line contains two integers(ai and bi) separated by space

 

Output

Output N lines, each line contains minimum number of bits require to change ai to bi.

 

Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ 10^9

 

Example
Input:
2
1 3
4 3

Output:
1
3
 

Explanation
Example case:
For 1 and 3 binary values are 01 and 11, so we need to change 1 bit for get 3 from 1
