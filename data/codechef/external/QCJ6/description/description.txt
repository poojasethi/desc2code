In each turn a player can move exactly one coin to any square to the left i.e, if a player wishes to remove a coin from square i, he can then place it in any square which belongs to the set (0,1, ... i-1) . Given the description of the board and also assuming that Tom always makes the first move you have tell who wins the game (Assuming Both play Optimally).
