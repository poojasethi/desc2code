The Bridges of San Mochti

Clowns before joining Synapse have to undergo a series of traing excercises.   One of the training exercises is to cross a series of rope
bridges set high in the trees.  Every bridge has a maximum capacity,
which is the number of people that the bridge can support without
breaking.  The goal is to cross the bridges as quickly as possible,
subject to the following tactical requirements:

One unit at a time!
If two or more people can cross a bridge at the same time (because
they do not exceed the capacity), they do so as a unit; they walk as
close together as possible, and they all take a step at the same time.
It is never acceptable to have two different units on the same bridge
at the same time, even if they don't exceed the capacity.  Having
multiple units on a bridge is not tactically sound, and multiple units
can cause oscillations in the rope that slow everyone down.  This rule
applies even if a unit contains only a single person.
Keep moving!
When a bridge is free, as many people as possible begin to cross
it as a unit.  Note that this strategy doesn't always lead to an
optimal overall crossing time (it may be faster for a group to wait
for people behind them to catch up so that more people can cross at
once).  But it is not tactically sound for a group to wait, because
the people they're waiting for might not make it, and then they've not
only wasted time but endangered themselves as well.

Periodically the bridges are reconfigured to give the trainees a
different challenge.  Given a bridge configuration, your job is to
calculate the minimum amount of time it would take a group of people
to cross all the bridges subject to these requirements.
For example, suppose you have nine people who must cross two
bridges: the first has capacity 3 and takes 10 seconds to cross; the
second has capacity 4 and takes 60 seconds to cross.  The initial
state can be represented as (9 0 0), meaning that 9 people
are waiting to cross the first bridge, no one is waiting to cross the
second bridge, and no one has crossed the last bridge.  At 10 seconds
the state is (6 3 0).  At 20 seconds the state is
(3 3 /3:50/ 0), where /3:50/ means that a unit of three
people is crossing the second bridge and has 50 seconds left.  At 30
seconds the state is (0 6 /3:40/ 0); at 70 seconds it's
(0 6 3); at 130 seconds it's (0 2 7); and at 190
seconds it's (0 0 9).  Thus the total minimum time is 190
seconds.
Input: The input consists of one or more bridge
configurations, followed by a line containing two zeros that signals
the end of the input.  Each bridge configuration begins with a line
containing a negative integer –B and a positive integer P, where
B is the number of bridges and P is the total number of people that
must cross the bridges.  Both B and P will be at most 20.  (The reason
for putting –B in the input file is to make the first line of a
configuration stand out from the remaining lines.)  Following are B
lines, one for each bridge, listed in order from the first bridge that
must be crossed to the last.  Each bridge is defined by two positive
integers C and T, where C is the capacity of the bridge (the maximum
number of people the bridge can hold), and T is the time it takes to
cross the bridge (in seconds).  C will be at most 5, and T will be at
most 100.  Only one unit, of size at most C, can cross a bridge at a
time; the time required is always T, regardless of the size of the
unit (since they all move as one).  The end of one bridge is always
close to the beginning of the next, so the travel time between bridges
is zero.
Output: For each bridge configuration, output one line
containing the minimum amount of time it will take (in seconds) for
all of the people to cross all of the bridges while meeting both
tactical requirements.
