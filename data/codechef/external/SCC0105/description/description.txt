Tom is fond of permutations. He tricks every one by his strange problems. Here is one of them.
Once he gave Jerry an infinite supply of positive (natural) numbers .
Then he challenged him if he could pick up certain set of numbers such that their sum is equal to a particular number N.
Jerry being brilliant quickly found a solution. This deeply hurt the ego of Tom. 
Now Tom was furious and asked Jerry if he could tell him the count of all possible solutions to this problem.
He also added one more constraint that is Jerry must pick exactly K numbers to form the required set.
Two sets of K-tuples (n1,n2,.....,nK) , (a1,a2,.....,ak) are considered different if for  atleast one i => ni != ai . 
For example for N=5 and K=2 (2,3) and (1,4) are distinct also (1,4) and (4,1) are distinct. Hence a total of 4 such sets could be formed.

Input
The first line contains one integer T, the number of test cases.
Next T lines contains two space separated integers N, K.
N= The sum that is required to be produced
K= The number of positive integers in a set that sum upto N 

Output
Output a single line corresponding to each test case the count of number of solution possible.
Output -1 if no solution exists.
Since the answer can be large so take MOD with 10^9 + 7.

Constraints

0 < T ≤ 100000
0 < N ≤ 10000
0 < K ≤ 10000
