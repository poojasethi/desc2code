This time little Avani is interested in finding the LCM of the m^th and n^th Fibonacci numbers. She will provide you with two integers m and n and you have to help her by finding LCM(Fm , Fn) mod 10^9 + 7.
In mathematics, Fibonacci numbers are the numbers defined by the following recurrence relation.
Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2
and F1 = F2 = 1


Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. T lines follow. Each line contains two space separated integers m and n


Output
For each test case, output a single line containing answer to the query.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100000
1 ≤ m , n ≤ 5000



Example
Input:
3
1 1
3 4
