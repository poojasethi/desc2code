Double Near Palindromes
C-3PO is an expert in
pretty much every language. His conversation with R2-D2 are
always fun to observe un that R2-D2 speaks in Droid, C-3PO speak in English,
and they understand each other perfectly! Anyway, humans and droids both enjoy
playing word games. A palindrome is a word or sequence of one or more letters
that reads the same forwards and backwards. A near palindrome is a word or
sequence that can be changed to or kept a palindrome by changing exactly one
letter to a different letter. For example, BAT is a near palindrome, since
changing the T to a B would make the word a palindrome: BAB. PEEP is not a near
palindrome: although PEEP is palindrome, changing any letter would remove its
palindrome status.A double near palindrome is a word or sequence that consists
of two near palindromes concatenated together. For example, BATMAN is a double
near palindrome, since BAT and MAN are both near palindromes. Given a list of
words, you are to determine which words are double near palindromes and which
are not.
Input
The input consists of one
or more words. All words (except the last) will be inclusively between 1 and 25
letters long and will consist of entirely of capital letters. The last word
will be *END* and is not be processed; it simply indicates the end of the
input. There may be any number of spaces and characters before, after, and
between words.
Output
The output cases are to
appear in the same order in which they appear in the input. For each input
case, you are to print either w is a double near palindrome. or
w is not a double near palindrome. whichever is appropriate, where w is the
input word. Exactly one should follow each output case (meaning there should be
no blank lines in the output).
 
Sample Input:
BATMAN CONSTANTINOPLE *END*
 
Sample Output:
BATMAN is a double near palindrome. CONSTANTINOPLE is not a double near palindrome.
