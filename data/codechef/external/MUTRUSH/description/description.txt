Our new era superhero JAGGI is fighting to save the world, he has to find and kill mutants who live in random houses within a straight street. Since we live in a modern world, the mutants of this world are very smart and no one knows in which house they live. In fact, even they don’t know where the other mutants live but they do have some kind of pattern according to which they choose their respective house numbers.
Fortunately, JAGGI is aware of this pattern which says that the address of the next mutant can be found by killing the previous three mutants and adding their respective house addresses. JAGGI has started working and has already found the address of the first three villains of the street: Address 0, Address 1 and Address 2. But JAGGI doesn’t want to hurt anyone except the mutants, so he has to be sure and wants to find the address of all the houses where the mutants live. 
He randomly decides to choose a house number and asks you whether a mutant lives there or not. Help him by answering his query in the form: YES or NO. 
INPUT
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. For each test case there will be a single integer which represents the house number.

OUTPUT
