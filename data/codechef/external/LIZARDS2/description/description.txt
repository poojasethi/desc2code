 

N lizards are standing in a line, each of them is either facing left or right with equal probability. A pair of indices (i,j) (iafraid pair if lizard at index i is facing right, and lizard at index j is facing left.
What is the expected number of afraid pairs?

 

Input
Input description.
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. For each case there is a single line containing N, the number of lizards.
 

Output
Output description.
For each test case, output a single line containing the expected number of lizards as an irreducible fraction. See the sample output for the exact format.
 

Constraints

 T  = 1000 
  1  <=  N  <=  10^9  

 

Example
Input:
2
2
3

Output:
1/4
3/4
 

Explanation
Example case 1. There are four possible ways: LL, LR, RR, RL. Of these only 1 has an afraid pair.
