There were a little elephant and an ox in Byteland. They were best 
friends. Once they went to forest to get some fruits. The little 
elephants could get N fruits and the ox got M fruits. While returning 
home, they decided to equalize the number of fruits they have. So, they 
decided to play a game.
In each turn, one will divide the fruits of the 
other into some groups such that each group has equal number of fruits 
and then he will keep one group apart and eat all fruits in the other 
groups (see explanation) . The game continues until the number of fruiits 
they have becomes equal.The little elephant starts the game.
Now, you have to tell how many maximum number of fruits they can take 
home after this game.

Input
First line of the input contains a single integer T, the number of test 
cases. Then T lines follow, each line having two space separated integers 
N and M, which denote the number of fruits they initially have.

Output
For each test case output a single line containg an integer which is the
maximum number of fruits they can take home.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤  10000 
1 ≤ N, M ≤ 10000 

 

Example
Input:
2
4 6
5 3

Output:
2
1
 

Explanation
Case 1:Initially the little elephant has 4 fruits and the ox has 6 
fruits. In the first turn, elephant forms 3 groups of 2 fruits each. He 
leaves 2 fruits and eat other 4. So, the ox now has 2 fruits. In the 
second turn, ox can divide 4 fruits into 2 groups of 2 fruits each. He 
leaves 2 fruits and eat the rest. Now they both have same number of 
fruits i.e 2. You can check that they can't have more than 2 fruits after 
the game.
