 
Problem description.
Wonder Woman is tensed seeing Batman and Superman fighting. She need to stop this fight as soon as possible. But, she can't do it alone. She has started recruiting new superhumans. She gets a list of N names as strings. Some superhumans have given their name more than once. She gives you M queries. In each query, she gives you two indices for that array. In each query, consider the list of strings between indices l and r in the original list. Make a new list with all the distinct strings in that sub-array and sort it lexicographically. You need to output the power of the team containing these people. The power of this team is given by summation i*size(s[i]) in this new list.


Input
First line contains T ,the number of test cases.


Second line contains two space seperated integers N and M.

Then follow N strings denoting the names of superhumans.

Then follow M queries contain l and r as explained in the problem statement.



Output
Print the power of the team for every query in a new line.


Constraints

Sum of N over all test cases <=10^4
Sum of Q over all test cases <=10^4
1<=l<=r<=N


Example
Input:
1
2 3
cyborg
flash
1 2
1 1
2 2
Output:
16
6
5
 

Explanation
For first query New list is {cyborg,flash}
and answer is 1*(size(cyborg))+2*(size(flash))=16
