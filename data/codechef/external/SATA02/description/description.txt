Lukas just bought a new phone so he has decided to sell his old phone. He needs to decide a price at which he will sell his phone. There are n prospective buyers and each one of them has a secret valuation for the phone which is unknown to Lukas. Analysing historical data,Lukas finds out that the valuation of each prospective buyer is a number chosen uniformly at random from [0,100] dollars. If the valuation of any of the buyers is greater than the price set by Lukas, he will be able to sell his phone at the price set by him. Help Lukas set a  price to maximize his expected revenue.
 

Input
