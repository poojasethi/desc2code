 
With the increasing popularity of Chef Po, many other chefs started to dislike him. So one day they decided that they will make chef Po indulge in a question so that he could not complete the food service in time, which will result in his unpopularity. They went to Chef Po and asked him, given a number N find the greatest Devil number K such that K<=N.  A number is Devil if it contains only 1 and 3.
