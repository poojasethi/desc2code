Sherlock has recently started playing DOTA - the most addictive strategy game of all time. His favorite attack in the game is the "LVL-Death" spell of a hero called Doom Bringer. 
Every time he upgrades this spell the chance that it deals additional damage changes. Suppose K is the power of the spell, Sherlock noticed that the spell deals additional damage to enemy heroes whose level is NOT a K-Prime* number. An enemy hero's level can be between 1 and 10^7.
*A K-Prime number is a positive integer that is not divisible by first K prime numbers. 
Sherlock wanted to know how effective his spell can be. He wants to know the probability(as an irreducible fraction) of the spell with a power level of K dealing additional damage to an enemy hero whose level could be between L and R (both inclusive).
Input
First line will contain a number Q. Next Q lines will contain 3 space separated integers L, R and K
Output
Your output should contain exactly Q lines where i-th line is the answer to the i-th query. For every query print the required probability as an irreducible fraction of the form numerator/denominator.
 
Constraints

1 <= Q <= 10^5
1 <=L, R<=10^7 
1 <=K <=10^6

 
Example
Input:
3
1 10 1
1 20 5
10 20 3

Output:
1/2
4/5
7/11Explanation:
For the first test case, the numbers {1,3,5,7,9} are not divisible by the first prime number(K=1) - 2 in the range between 1 and 10(L and R). Hence the probability is 5/10 = 1/2
Warning: Large I/O, be careful with certain languages.
