Problem description.

 Rihanna wonders why the starting numbers of Fibonacci series are always 0 and 1. She didn’t like that and thus want to change the starting numbers.

So given the 1st and 2nd numbers of series as a and b respectively. Find out the ‘r’ th number in the series for given r.

Input
First line has integer T, the number of test cases
Next T lines contain T test cases
each line contains integers  a ,b, and r 


Output
For each test case output the answer modulo 10^9 +7

Constraints
1<=T<=50000
0<=a,b<=1000000
1<=r<=1000000
 

Example
Input:

2
0 1 3
2 3 1


Output:

1
2
