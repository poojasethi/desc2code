An ant is caught on one corner of a cuboidal cake with sides l, b, and h. It wants to reach the diagonally opposite corner, However, the ant can perform a cakewalk only along the faces of the cake.
What is the least amount of distance that the ant needs to walk to reach the other corner?


Input

There are T test cases.


First line contains a single integer, T.
T lines follow, each containing 3 space separated numbers : l, b and h

 

Output
Output T lines, each containing a single floating point number, containing the least distance that the ant needs to travel. A rounding off error of 10^-6 will be tolerated. 
 

Constraints

 T  ≤  10^5 
 l, b, h  ≤  10^6
