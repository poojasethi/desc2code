Ruskin needs a railing around his swimming pool, but he is too lazy to build it himself. So he purchased a railing-building machine.
He wants the railing to be a regular polygon. The machine builds the railing along a single path, but it can only make railing corners at a single angle a.
Will the machine be able to build the railing Ruskin wants? In other words, is there a regular polygon which angles are equal to a?

Input 

The first line of input contains an integer t -the number of tests. Each of the following t lines contains a single integer a  — the angle the machine can make corners at measured in degrees.
T test cases follows:"


Output

For each test, output on a single line "YES" (without quotes), if the machine can build a railing Ruskin wants, and "NO" (without quotes), if it is impossible.


Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 179
1 ≤ a ≤ 179

 
Input:
3
30
60
90


Output:
NO
YES
YES

 

Explanation
case 1. It is impossible to build the Railing, since there is no regular polygon with angle.  
case 2. The Railing is a regular triangle, and in the last test case — a square.
