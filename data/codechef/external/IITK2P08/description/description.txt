Devu found a 2-D matrix filled with Capital English Alphabets ('A' to 'Z') lying around in Churu's lab. He got very fascinated with the matrix and asked Churu to give the matrix to him so that he can play with it. Churu, although being a nice guy was not so nice to him, and asked him a puzzle and promised to give it to him only if Devu solves the puzzle correctly.
Devu really wanted to have the matrix  so he asks you for help. Will you help him ?

The puzzle is to count the number of sub-matrices containing exactly K distinct letters.


Input

The first line of the input contains two space separated integers N and K. N denotes the size of the matrix i.e., the matrix is a square N x N matrix. K is as explained in the problem statement.


Output

Output the the number of such sub-matrices  in a single line.


Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 100
1 ≤ K ≤ 26


Example
Input:
4 1
ABAB
