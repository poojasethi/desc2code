Â 
Mary is having a party because his team won the African cup so he is inviting his friends to eat some pizza.
Unfortunately, Mary's friends can't eat an entire pizza but all of them know exactly how much pizza
they can eat and insist on getting the exact amount of pizza but Mary eats one complete pizza
and all of them wants his amount of pizza in one slice.
Their requests break down to three different pizza slices-either one quarter or a half or three quarters of pizza.
Write a program that will help Mary to find out what is the minimal number of pizzas he has to order so that
everyone gets exact amount of pizza they want.

Input format :

First line contains an integer N, 0<=N<=10,000 , number of friends. 
In each of next N lines there is amount of pizza that each of Mary's friends wants to eat, that

Output format :

In the first and only line you should write the minimal number of pizzas Mary has to order. (Don't forget to order
one complete pizza for Mary)
