 
A guy named Cman attends the final grade of a high school. One day Cman decided to
watch a match of his favorite football team. And, as the boy loves football very much,
even more than linear algebra, he forgot to do the homework. Specifically, he forgot to
complete his linear algebra tasks. Next day the teacher got very angry at Cman and
decided to teach him a lesson. He gave the lazy student a seemingly easy task: You are
given an idle body in space and the forces that affect it. The body can be considered as a
material point with coordinates (0, 0, 0). Cman had only to answer whether it is in
equilibrium. According to the teacher a body is considered to be in
equilibrium if and only if the coordinates of the resulting vectors are prime
numbers. So, Cman began to solve the problem. But later it turned out that there can
be lots and lots of these forces, and Cman can not cope without your help. Help him.
Write a program that determines whether a body is idle or is moving by the given
vectors of forces.
Note : The resulting vector acting on a body is the vector having x, y and z coordinate
as sum of all x[i], y[i] and z[i] respectively.
 

Input
First line of input will contain a single integer “T” representing number of test cases.
First line of each test case will contain a single integer “N” denoting number of force
vectors acting on the idle body.
Next N lines will contain three space separated integer i.e. x[i] coordinate, y[i]
coordinate and z[i] coordinate of force vector i..

Output
For each test output the word "YES" if the body is in equilibrium, or the word "NO" if
it is not

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 1000
0 ≤ x[i] ≤ 100
0 ≤ y[i] ≤ 100
0 ≤ z[i] ≤ 100

 

Example
Input:
2
3
2 1 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
3
5 7 11
3 7 5
3 5 3

Output:
NO
YES

 

Explanation
Example case 1.When we sum up the force vector i.e. sum up x[i], y[i] and z[i] we got 11, 14,
18 i.e. (2+4+3, 1+5+8, 3+6+9) so the y and z coordinate of the resulting vector are not
prime so the body is not in equilibrium state. Hence, we print NO for first test-case.
