Problem description.
 Rihanna wants to find the number of triangles that can be formed with n lines, no three lines are concurrent.
But there are many sets of parallel lines in those lines.


Input
 First line has integer T, the number of test cases
In each test case 1st line has two integers n,m
n represents the number of line and m represents the number of sets of parallel lines
 Next line contains m  intergers  m1,m2,m3,m4… , each integer is the number of parallel line in each set.


Output
For each test case output the number of triangles  that can be formed  modulo 10^9 +7 

Constraints
1<=T<=6
3<=n<=10^9
0<=m<=100000
2<=m1,m2,m3…<=n
m1+m2+m3<=n
 

Example
Input:
2
3 0
7 2
3 3

Output:
1
9
