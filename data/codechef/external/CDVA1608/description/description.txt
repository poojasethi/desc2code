In Berland a new movie was released on the occassion of 14th Feb. The craze for this movie was very much among the peoples of the city. So many of them decided to go to the only Movie Theatre of Berland. As berland is very much developed there are many large(tall) buildings, including the movie theatre.

You will be given the distance between building D[i] and the speed of each taxi driver S[i].
