Akash gave a number N and asked Rcc whether it is prime or not. Rcc is obsessed with prime so for small numbers (less than 100) he could answer the question. Now akash gave a number > 1000 and asked Rcc whether the number is prime or not. 

Input
The first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.

Each line of the test case contains a number N.


Output
