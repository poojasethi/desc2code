Keyboard typing is the main source of our input to the computer. We use keyboard for textual inputs. But to err is human. Suppose that in typing a document the user makes a mistake. He types a letter to the right of the actual character letter on the keyboard. Write a program to take the user string as input and display the actual correct string.
Note: Apply the required constraint.


Example

Input:
Sdfghj
Output:
Asdfgh
