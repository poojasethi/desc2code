Raju and Rada planned a trip to Egypt inspired by the movie ‘THE MUMMY’, not a pleasure trip. They went to Egypt by plane. On plane they met a curator who works at the British museum.
He gave them a map containing some interesting places in Egypt.
After lots of discussion they decided to go ‘HAMUNAPTRA-The city of the death ‘ which contained huge number of pyramids and sand arts.
At the earliest they reached HAMUNAPRA. They entered a pyramid .there was a huge door. Raju and radha failed to open the door. So they decided to go back. Bt radha find some words written on the walls of the pyramid. They referred the map given by the curator. It says arrange them in such a way that every word begins with the same letter as the previous word ends and write on the sand door will open.
For example, the word ``proti'' can be followed by the word ``imhotep''.
The task given to you guys is to write a computer program that will read the list of words and determine whether it is possible to arrange all of them in a sequence (according to the given rule) and consequently to open the door.

Input
The input consists of T test cases.
The number of them (T, equal to about 500) is given on
The first line of the input file.
Each test case begins with a line containing a single integer number N that indicates the number of plates
(1 <= N <= 100000). Then exactly N lines follow, each containing a single word. Each word contains at least two and at most 1000 lowercase characters. The same word may appear several times in the list.

Output
Your program has to determine whether it is possible to arrange all the plates in
a sequence such that the first letter of each word is equal to the last letter of the previous word. All the plates from the list must be used, each exactly once. The words mentioned several times must be used that number of times.
If there exists such an ordering of plates, your program should print the sentence "The journey continues.”. Otherwise, output the sentence "Journey ends here.".

Example

Input:
3
2
anak
sunamum
3
suyathuo
lordevys
orphanx
2
hmm
hmm

Output:
Journey ends here.
The journey continues.
Journey ends here.
