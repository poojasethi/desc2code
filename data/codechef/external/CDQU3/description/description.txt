 
Ramanujan loves to play with numbers. He once asked everyone in his class a question :
“Given a Number N, what is the smallest number which can be formed whose product of DIGITS will be equal to N?  For example if N is 100 the number is 455.” 
His friend pointed out to him that there are certain numbers which cannot be formed in this manner. Ramanujan took due note of that and told everyone in his class to try solving this problem through programming.
Your task is to Print the Smallest Number Whose Product of Digits is Equal to N. If there is no such number, you MUST print -1.

 

Input
The First Line of Input will contain an Integer T, Denoting the Number of Test Cases.                                Each of the next T lines , each , will have a positive whole number N.

Output
For each Test Case, Print on a new line the smallest number whose product of digits is N. If there is no such number print -1.

Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 10^3 (30 Points)
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^16 (70 Points) 

 

Example
Input:
3100139                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 

Output:
455-119
 

Explanation
In the first case, the smallest number whose product of digits is 100 is 455 as 4*5*5=100. For the second case there are no numbers in which the product of digits will give us the original number. So we print -1. For the third case 9 can be represented as 1*9 hence number is 19. 
 The Input and Output Format must be Strictly Followed.
