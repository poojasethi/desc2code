Here is another mathematical problem, where the trick is as much to discover the algorithm as it is to write the code: write a program to display all possible permutations of a given input string--if the string contains duplicate characters, you may have multiple repeated results. 


Input
Input should be of the form 

Permute  string


Output
Output should be a word per line.


Example

Input:

cat

Output:

cat
cta
act
atc
tac
tca
