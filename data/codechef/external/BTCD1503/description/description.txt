Problem description.

Alia has just started learning algorithms. Her coach has given her this pseudocode.
	
	res <- 0
	for i=1 to B-1:
		if gcd(B,i)=1:
			res <- res+i*i
	print(res)

For each test case, given B print a single line giving  (res%1000000007). 
 

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases, which is followed by T inegers.

 

Output

For each test case, output a single line giving the integer result.

 

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
1 ≤ N ≤ 1000000000
