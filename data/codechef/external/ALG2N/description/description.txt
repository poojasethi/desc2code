But he got puzzled after a few calculations. So gave you the job to generate the solutions to 2^n and find their sum of digits.


Input
N : number of inputs N ≤ 100
then N lines with input T ≤ 2000


Output
The output for the corresponding input T


Example

Input:
3
5
10
4

Output:
5
7
7

Explanation:
2^5=32
3+2=5
2^10=1024
1+0+2+4=7
2^4=16
