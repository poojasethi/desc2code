Jasmine is a very lazy girl. She always sleeps in Maths class. One day her teacher catches her sleeping and tells her that he would mark her absent for the whole semester. While he pretends to be strict, he is actually very kind-hearted. So he wants to give Jasmine a chance to prove herself. He gives her a problem. If Jasmine can answer it correctly, he will forgive her. Can you help Jasmine find the answer to this problem? 
The problem: The teacher gives Jasmine a number N and asks her to find out the probability that any proper divisor of N would be an even perfect square. 
Note: Even perfect square means the number should be even and a perfect square. 
Input Format 
The first line of input contains an integer T, the number of test cases. T lines follow, each line containing N, the number that the teacher provides. 
Output Format 
For each test case, print in a newline the output in p/q format where p and q are positive coprime integers. If p is 0, you should simply output 0. 
Constraints
