Background

During a plain crash every person died other than one. When he woke up he found himself in Bermuda triangle. No one was there to help him, but luckily he found a map of an archipelago in crashed plainâ€™s garbage which consists of grid squares with characters, where '#' indicates land and '.' indicates water. Two land squares belong to the same island if they are neighboring grid squares, which means their x coordinates and y coordinates differ by at most 1.
To escape from this island he have to find the near by island so that he can get back to his home. Help him to find the number of islands shown in the map.


Input: 

The first line of the input contains a number which indicates the number of test cases to follow.
Each test case starts with a line containing two numbers n and m, the number of rows and the number of columns of the grid, respectively. The following n lines contain m characters each and describe the map to be processed. You may assume that the map contains only characters '#' and '.', and that the border of the map consists only of water (character '.').


Output: 

For each test case print in a line the number of islands shown on the corresponding map in the input.
