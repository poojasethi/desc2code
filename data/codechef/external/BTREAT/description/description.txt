Its Chef's Birthday and his friends are demanding him for treat. So he went to the shop to buy N gift packets (one for each friend). Each gift packet bought from shop contains some number of chocolates in it. 

Chef believes in equality i.e. all gift packets should contain equal number of chocolates in it. So Chef thought to rearrange the chocolates, one by one, such that all gift packets should contain equal number of chocolates afterwards.

But since its Chef's Birthday he wants to do this in minimum number of chocolates moved. Help Chef to do this task and you might also get treat from Chef :p

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of gift packets. The second line contains N space-separated integers C1, C2, ..., CN denoting the number of chocolates in i^th gift packet. 


Output

For each test case, output a single line containing number of minimum moves required such that each gift packet contain equal number of chocolates. If it is not possible to do so then print "No Treat".


Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ Ci ≤ 10^6


Example
Input:
2
4
5 2 4 5
6
5 2 4 1 7 5

Output:
2
5

Explanation
Example case 1. Chef can move one chocolate from 1st gift packet to 2nd gift packet (distribution looks like 4 3 4 5). Now in next move he moves one chocolate from last gift packet to 2nd gift packet. Final distribution looks like 4 4 4 4 which took place in 2 moves.
