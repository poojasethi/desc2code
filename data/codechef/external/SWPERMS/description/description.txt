Your have written the numbers 1, 2, ..., n on a blackboard in that order. You are given m distinct pairs of integers 1 ≤ x_i,y_i ≤ n. You can perform several operations, where in a single operation you select a given pair (x_i, y_i) and swap the x_i'th and y_i'th numbers from the left. Note that the numbers written on the blackboard at any time is a permutation of 1, 2, ..., n. Find the number of possible permutations that can be written on the blackboard after a finite amount of operations. (You can use a pair as many times as you wish.)
Since the answer can be large, print it modulo 1000000007 (10^9+7)  

Input

 The first line contains two integers: n and m. 
The following m lines contain two integers each: x and y, meaning that (x, y) is one of the pairs you are allowed to swap. 


Output

Print a single line: the answer to the problem.


Constraints

1 ≤ n ≤ 100000
1 ≤ m ≤ 200000


Example
Input:
4 2
1 3
2 4

Output:
4


Explanation
Example case 1. You can use the pair (1, 3) to obtain the permutation [3, 2, 1, 4]. You can use the pair (2, 4) to obtain the permutation [1, 4, 3, 2]. You can use the pairs (1, 3), (2, 4) in that order to obtain the permutation [3, 4, 1, 2]. Another option is not using any pairs at all, this gives the permutation [1, 2, 3, 4]. These are the 4 permutations you can obtain.
