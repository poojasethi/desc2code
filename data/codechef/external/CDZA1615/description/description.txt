 
Ki and Ka like to play the game tower of Hanoi. One day Ki challenges Ka to build the tallest tower from a set of disks of different height and radius. The tower of Hanoi can be built by stacking disks on top of each other. In order to put disk A on top of disk B, the radius and height of A must be strictly smaller than those of B. Help Ka to win the challenge.
 

Input
First line of input contains number of test cases T.
First line of each test case contains value of N, the number of disks. The next N lines contains two positive integer number Ri and Hi corresponding to the radius and height of ith Disk respectively.

 

Output
For each test case print the maximum height of the tower possible.
 

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100000
1 ≤ N ≤ 2000
1 ≤ Ri ≤ 100000
1 ≤ Hi ≤ 100000
