Here's a challenge that's a bit more mathematical in nature. Write a program that determines the number of trailing zeros at the end of X! (X factorial), where X is an arbitrary number. For instance, 5! is 120, so it has one trailing zero. (How can you handle extremely values, such as 100!?) 



Example

Input:

An integer e.g 5!

Output:

No of trailing zeros in answer, 5! Is 120 so it has one trailing zero
