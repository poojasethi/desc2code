As Leonard was driving Sheldon to a comic book store, Sheldon broke up and said, "today i have found the most optimal solution to the problem that you were trying to solve for many many days". he immediately takes out his ipad and show him this code

int main() {
	int testcases;
	long long int number, count;
	scanf("%d", &testcases);
	while(testcases--) {
		scanf("%lld%lld", &number, &count);
		long long int temporary = number;
		while(count--) {
			temporary = (temporary - 1) & number;
		}
		printf("%lld\n", temporary);
	}
	return 0;
}
Leonard who has been working on this problem said,"this is not an optimal code, yes this will give a correct output but it will takes lots of time to produce it". Sheldon replied, "ok then lets have a bet if you give me a better code than this i will buy you the latest edition of batman action figure, otherwise you will have to give me your collection of superhero figures". Leonard is sure that this code will take lots of time in generating the output, but doesn't know how to make an optimal code. so please help Leonard by making a better code.

Input
First line contains the no of test cases 'T'.
Then 'T' lines follow each containing two integer 'number' and 'count'.

Output
'T' lines corresponding to each test case which contain the output of the above code if the input were 'number' and 'count' respectively.

LImits
T ≤ 1000000 
1 ≤ number, count ≤ 10 ^ 18

Example

Input:
2
13 4
12 3

Output:
5
0
