Catch Me If You Can 
There are N people playing a game called "Catch me if You Can". The game is like some pair of persons tied together by ropes. They have to run from each other as much far as they can. But since not all the persons are tied, some are free.
Input is given in form on N x N matrix, such that element(i,j) show length of rope between ith and jth person zero index. Distance can be digits or character.

	'0'-'9' : Distances 0 to 9 feet, in order
	'a'-'z':  Distances 10 to 35 feet, in order.
	'A'-'Z':  Distances 36 to 61 feet, in order.
	'-'    :  Hyphen means the pair is not tied.
	Given the two persons, tell the maximum distance that any pair can achieve. If there is no limit to distance, it should give -1.

Constraints

1<=t<=10
 2<=N <= 50
 i,j will vary from 0 to N-1
 Element (i,j) and (j,i) of matrix will be equal
 Element (i,i) will be 0
 Each element of matrix will be a digit ('0'-'9'), an uppercase letter ('A'-'Z'), a lowercase letter ('a'-'z') or a hyphen '-'


Input
First line taking t - test cases. t test cases follows. Every test case has an integer N , followed by N lines, each line having string of length N 

Output
Prints the maximum distance that can be achieved by two persons.If no limit, print -1
