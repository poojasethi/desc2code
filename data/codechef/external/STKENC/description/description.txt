 For Turbo C++ Users : Read the following document before attempting the question :  

 For C and C++ users, use long long instead of int. For Java users, use long.

 Problem description 

Data here, Data There. Data Everywhere.
Which one is mine though?

Main Proconist Dhruv has been given the task of encrypting a classified data file to be sent to Stockholm Convention. The encryption is as follows:
Given a number N, the encryption is a string made up of alphabets (a-z) such that the "sum of the rank of letters" is equal to the number N.

The  Rank  of a letter is the position of the letter in the alphabet. For eg. Rank("a") = 1 and Rank("t") = 20.
So according to the encryption, the no. 5 can be represented as "aac" or "ad" or "e" etc.
Since the network is slow, Dhruv wants to keep the size of the string as minimum as possible.
And he has asked for your help.


Input
The first line consists of T: the no. of test cases.

Every test case has one positive integer N.
 

Output
For every test case, output the minimum length of the encrypted string corresponding to the input N.
 

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^12

 

Example
Input:
3
50
34
23
Output:
2
2
1
 

Explanation
Example case 1. 50 can be encrypted as "yy"
Example case 2. 34 can be encrypted as "tn"
Example case 3. 23 can be encrypted as "w"
