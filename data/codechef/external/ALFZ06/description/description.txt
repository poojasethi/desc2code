 
We all know that girls love gifts, right? Well, if you have been into programming, you must be knowing about Alice and Bob. Alice and Bob have been dating since a while and so it's very natural that they'll meet over a cup of coffee today, i.e. the Valentine's Day :D
Bob is very confused as to what should he gift Alice today. He doesn't believe in giving expensive gifts (just like me :P), so he decides to give a custom selection of some fine dark chocolates which he plans to get gift wrapped along with a red rose. Sounds great!! :)
A small problem has cropped up though. The problem is, when he visits the chocolate shop, the shopkeeper shows him many small dark chocolates placed in a M X N box. Bob is having a hard time figuring out the different types of chocolates available in the box because the shopkeeper doesn't have the exact information about their flavors. Though he can distinguish them on the basis of their shape, their flavors are not known to him because similarly shaped chocolates may have the same or different flavor.
However, the shopkeeper does have some information in a weird format. He says that the chocolates which share an edge (which means they are adjacent to each other) have the same flavor. This implies that the box can have empty cells as well. Bob is curious as to how many different combinations of chocolates he can gift to Alice categorized on the basis of their flavors (and not shape)?
Note: Two combinations are different from each other if there is at least one chocolate in one of the combinations which has a flavor which is not present in any of the chocolates in the other. See examples for better understanding.


Input
The first line of the input consists of T, the no of test cases. The first line of each test case consists of two space separated integers M and N denoting the dimensions of the chocolate box. The next M lines consist of N characters denoting the contents of the cell: 'C' standing for a chocolate and 'E' standing for an an empty cell.
 

Output
For each test case, output on a new line the total no of different combinations possible modulo 1000000007.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
1 ≤ N, M ≤ 100

 

Example
Input:
2
3 3
CEE
ECE
EEC
1 2
CC

Output:
7
1
 

Explanation
Example case 1.There are three chocolates and all of these have different flavors. So, a total of 7 combinations are possible. Let the three chocolates be 1, 2 and 3 respectively.  Then the 7 combinations are (1), (2), (3), (1, 2), (1,3), (2, 3) and (1, 2, 3).
Example case 2.Here both the chocolates have the same flavor. Hence, answer is 1 since only a single flavor is available.
