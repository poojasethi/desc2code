Given a positive integer n, Chef has asked you to calculate the following sum in the most efficient way:

Here gcd(a,b) means   greatest common divisor of two integers a and b.

Input
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.The only line describing each test case contains a single integer n, given to you by Chef.

Please note that input can be very large. So it's recommended to use fast IO methods.

Output
For each test case, output a single line containing one integer: answer to Chef's query.
