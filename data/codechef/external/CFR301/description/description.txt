Write a program to calculate the H.C.F(Highest Common Factor) of fractions.
H.C.F. of fractions is calculated as (H.C.F. of Numerators)/(L.C.M. of Denominators)
For Example: The H.C.F of 5/18, 3/2 and 10/13 is 1/234.

Input

Input is a single line containing the number of fractions N (1<=N<=10) followed by  the numerator and denominator of fractions
(n1,d1,n2,d2.............nN,dN in each line)

1<=n<=100

1<=d<=100

Note: The simplified fractions would only be given as input.

Output
Output is a single containing the H.C.F. of fractions. Output should be in the format "numerator/denominator" without qoutes.
Note: Directly output the answer, do not try to simplify it.

Example

Input:
3
5
18
3
2
10
13
Output:
1/234
