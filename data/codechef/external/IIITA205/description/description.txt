 
Given a set of n numbers. A group is subset of these numbers such that all elements contained inside the group have gcd/hcf 1.
Find the maximum possible value of size of such group.
 

Input
First line contains a single integer t, representing the no of test cases.
	For each test case:-
		First line contains a single integer n,size of input array
		Second line contains n numbers a[1],a[2],.....,a[n]

Output
For each test case output a single integer representing the required answer.
 

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ N ≤ 20
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^6

 

Example
Input:
3
3
3 4 5
4
2 4 8 16
4
2 3 4 8

Output:
3
0
4
 
Explaination:
 Sample 1: 
HCF of 3,4,5 is 1. Hence group size = 3.
Sample 2:
No group possible whose HCF is 1.Hence 0.
