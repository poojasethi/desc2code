 
Write a program to swap odd and even bits in an integer with as few instructions as
possible (e.g., bit 0 and bit 1 are swapped, bit 2 and bit 3 are swapped, etc).


Input
An integer x

Output
For each input output a single line consisting of an integer whose binary value is the value after swapping the odd and even bits of the binary value of integer x


Example
Input 1:
10

Output 1:
5

Input 2:
14

Output 2:
13
 

Explanation
For the first case:
input : 10 => 1010
output: 5  => 0101(0th bit and 1st bit have been swapped,also 2nd and 3rd bit have been swapped) 
For the second case:
input : 14 => 1110
output: 13  => 1101(0th bit and 1st bit have been swapped,also 2nd and 3rd bit have been swapped)

Note:LSB is the rightmost bit
