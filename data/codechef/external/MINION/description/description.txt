Problem

			Infinite army of minions are racing on an infinite 2-D plane.

			Here's how they race:

			Each minion chooses exactly one x coordinate and races along it in positive y direction,
			starting from (x, 0). There exists exactly one minion for each x coordinate on that plane and hence there are infinite minions!

			There are N horizontal barriers lying on this plane. The ith barrier is defined by (xi, yi) and di, which means that the barrier is blocking all minions which want to pass through points lying on line segment connecting (xi, yi) and (xi + di, yi). Once a minion encounters a barrier, it stops moving.

			Given all the barriers, your task is to find the total number of minions that will be blocked at some point in their race.

Input

			The first line contains an integer N which denotes the number of barriers. Next N lines follow, each contains 3 space separated integers, "xi yi di" as explained in problem statement above.

Note: The barriers in the input may overlap.
		

Output

			Output a single integer, the number of MINIONS that will be blocked at some point in their race.
		

Constraints


					1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5




					1 ≤ xi, yi, di ≤ 10^9



Sample Input

2
1 1 4
7 3 5


Sample Output
11

Explanation

			Here 5 Minions will be blocked on points (1, 1), (2, 1) , (3, 1), (4, 1) and (5, 1).
			6 Minions will be blocked on (7, 3), (8, 3), (9, 3), (10, 3), (11, 3), (12, 3).
			In total, 11 minions are blocked in their race.
