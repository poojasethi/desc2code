Ravichandran Ashwin, the ace spinner of the Indian Cricket Team was looking for a way to enhance his bowling skills before the start of the World T20 tournament. He decided to consult Indian Cricketing Legend Anil Kumble, but little did he know that apart from cricket Kumble was also an algorithm expert and decided that he will only entertain Ashwin's request if he or his friends could solve a simple problem.
Given a tree of N nodes, you need to solve Q queries. In each query you will be given U and K, You need to print the number of nodes which are at a distance ≤ K from node U (including U). Can you help Ashwin crack this problem.

Input

First line consists of a single integer N denoting the number of nodes.
Next N-1 lines contain two space separated integers u and v denoting an undirected edge between nodes u and v in the tree (1 ≤ u,v ≤ N).
Next line consists of a single integer Q denoting the number of queries.
Next Q lines contain two space separated integers U (1 ≤ U ≤ N) and K.

 

Output

Output Q lines denoting the answer for each query.

 

Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 100000
1 ≤ Q ≤ 100000
0 ≤ K ≤ 15
