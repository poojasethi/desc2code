Points:10Mr.Krypto is one of the most brilliant people working at INSAF and even has an international reputation. Like many highly intelligent people, Mr. Krypto is also a bit ... eccentric. One fine day, the security keypad stopped working to his office. Every time Mr. Krypto entered the 4 digit pass code, a seemingly random no would be generated. Instead of getting the technician to repair it, Mr Krypto put a chair in front of it and started figuring the order in this seeming randomness. Yet so much work remains to be done at the Force, and Mr. Krypto is the best man for the job. Can you help him out to figure the anomaly so that he could return to work as soon as possible?
