 
Those who take admission into JSS have to deposit some amount of security money. This money compensates for any damage done by a student during his course. In the academic year 2014-15, the accounts office is very sensitive about the finances and hence keeps on checking how much money they will have to return to students when they leave. Also they update the security deposit of students when they cause some damage or attend a workshop on behalf of JSS.
Now, Mr.X at accounts office is not very good with numbers and hence is worried about how to reply to all the queries of his boss. You being a nice programmer decides to help him.
You are given an array S of N integers with i^th integer representing the security deposit of student with roll number i in 2015 batch. After that q queries are given of following types-

0 x y - Print the security deposit which should be returned to students with roll numbers ranging from x to y.
1 x k - Subtract amount k from security deposit of student with roll number x.


Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
Foe each test case 

First line contains two space separated integers N and Q, number of elements and number of queries.
Next line contains N space separated integers.
Next Q lines follow with each line having a query of either of the given types.

 

Output

For each query of type 0, output the summation of the total security to be paid to students with roll numbers ranging from x to y.

 

Constraints
Note: Assume 1 based indexing.

1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ Q ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ N
1 ≤ Si ≤ 10^6
1 ≤ k ≤ 10^6
