There are N different colors available to Chef, this Holi.Every color has a different intensity value Ni(1 ≤ i ≤ N).
Chef wants to mix all the colors available to him and make a new color out of the colors available to him. 
The Mixing is defined as a process in which he takes XOR of each color with every other colors with no repeatation of color combination available to him and then add them all to get the intensity of the resulting color. 

Input

First line contains the number of colors N available to Chef. 
Next N lines contains intensities of different colors available to him.


Output

Print in a single line the intensity of the resulting color.


Constraints
