In mathematics, a square-free integer is one divisible by no perfect square, except 1. For example, 10 is square-free but 18 is not, as it is divisible by 9. Some square-free numbers are
    1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19, 21, 22, 23, 26, 29, 30, 31, 33, 34, 35, 37, 38, 39....
Your job is to calculate Nth square free number. For Example: if N=1 then output is 1 and if N=7 then output is 10.



Input
Input will begin with an integer T, the number of test cases. Then there are T lines, each containing exactly one number N. 1 ≤ T ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ N ≤ 10,000,000


Output
For every number N, output a single line containing Nth square free number.


Example

Input:
4
1
7
13
100

Output:
1
10
19
163
