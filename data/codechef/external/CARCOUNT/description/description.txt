In primary classes, we were taught how to add multi-digit numbers from right-to-left one digit at a time. Many of us found the carry operation - in which a 1 is carried from one digit position to be added to the next - to be a significant challenge at that point of time. (You may find it challenging yet again if you can't solve this D:) Your task is to count the number of carry operations required for adding two multi digit numbers.
 Please take care of constraints, they may be extremely large 

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The next T lines contain 2 space-separated integers denoting the first and the second number for addition operation.

 

Output

For each test case, output the number of carry operations required for the addition operation.

 

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
1 ≤ a,b ≤ 10^15
