 
Geek Sundaram is extremely anxious. He is in a hectic schedule. He has to study for his assessment the next day, watch FRIENDS tv show (in spite of watching every episode more than 5 times.. :P ), prepare questions for the programming contest and also complete his projects. So his friends try to calm him down by advising whether he can complete all his tasks in the given time period. 
 Given the time taken (in seconds) to study S, to watch TV W, to prepare questions Q and do project  P  and the total time available until the deadline T, print "YES" if Geek can complete all the tasks within the deadline, otherwise print "NO". (quotes for clarity)

P.S. Geek doesn't have the power to multi task
