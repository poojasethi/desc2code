Problem description.
Chris brown and Rihanna are in a nxn grid(1 indexed). Chris brown want to reach Rihanna in minimum number of moves but the thing is he can move only diagonally and whatever may be the number of steps he takes it is considered as only one move unless he takes a turn.

Output
 Print the minimum number of moves.
If he can’t reach print  -1


Constraints
1<=T<=50000
1<=n<= 2^64 - 1  
1<=x1,y1,x2,y2<=n
