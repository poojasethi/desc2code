 
You are given an integer, N. Write a program to determine if N is an element of the Fibonacci sequence.

The first few elements of the Fibonacci sequence are 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,⋯. A Fibonacci sequence is one where every element is a sum of the previous two elements in the sequence. The first two elements are 0 and 1.

Formally:

fib0
fib1
:
:
fibnn-1+fibn-2∀n>1

 

Input
The first line contains T, number of test cases.
T lines follow. Each line contains an integer N.
 

Output
Display IsFibo if N is a Fibonacci number and IsNotFibo if it is not. The output for each test case should be displayed in a new line.
 

Constraints
1≤T≤10^5 
1≤N≤10^10
 


Example
Input:
3
5
7
8

Output:
IsFibo
IsNotFibo
IsFibo
 

Explanation
5 is a Fibonacci number given by fib5
7 is not a Fibonacci number 
8 is a Fibonacci number given by fib6
