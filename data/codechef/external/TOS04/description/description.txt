Robb Stark is marching towards King’s Landing with his army to take revenge for his family.
But the Lannisters are very treacherous and have devised a magic serum that enhances the strength of its army.
Thankfully a Stark spy tells Robb Stark about the magic serum. Now Stark wizard sits down to find out a solution for this serum.
Each soldier in Stark army has a strength represented as an integer.
Meanwhile the wizards have found the solution for the magic portion. They told that any group of 2 or 3 soldiers whose combined strength is a multiple of 3 are strong enough to fight against the Lannisters’ army.
Following are the properties of the group:
•	Combined strength of soldiers in a group must be a multiple of 3.
•	A groups can contain 2 or 3 soldiers.
•	Any soldier can be present in more than one group.
•	Strength of each soldier is different.
•	No two groups can be completely identical, at least one soldier must be different.
•	Strength of groups can be same.
Robb Stark sends you a raven and ask for your help.
Help Robb Stark by giving total number of groups that are capable to fight against the Lannisters’ army.

Input
