 
Alan plans a heist to rob a bank. The bank has  N vaults containing money .Each vault is numbered from 1 to N. The ith vault of the bank contains rupees i. All the vaults are initially closed. But since the bank contains so much money, it has routine security checks in the following manner:    N security guards enter the bank.                                                                                                 The first security guard opens all the vaults.                                                                                    The second security guard closes every second vault.                                                                                       The third security guard opens every third vault.                                                                                In this manner, the ith security guard reverses the state(open or closed) of every ith vault in the bank.
Alan enters the bank after all N security guards have finished their routine check. He can only rob all the open vaults. But before he commits the robbery, Alan decides to calculate the total amount of money he can rob. But since Alan is weak in mathematics, he asks you for help. Your task is to calculate the total amount of money Alan can rob from the bank.

(It is obvious that Alan can only steal money from all the OPEN vaults.)


Input
The first line of input will contain an integer T which denotes the number of test cases. 
The next T lines will each have a positive whole number number N, denoting the number of vaults in the bank and also the Number of Guards that will be doing the routine check.


Output
For each test case, Output a single line containing the total amount of money Alan can rob from the bank.

Constraints
:

1 ≤ N ≤ 1000 (30 Points)
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^12(40 Points) (Easier Test Cases) 
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^12(30 Points) 

 

Example
Input:
235

Output:
15
 

Explanation
In the first case, there are 3 vaults. The vault which is open after 3 guards  do the routine check is only Vault Number 1. Hence Amount which can be stolen is 1. In the second case, There are 5 vaults. After 5 security guards enter, the open vaults are number 1 and number 4. Since the ith vault has i rupees, the amount which can be stolen is 1+4=5. 

TIPS
The input and output format is to be Strictly Followed.Each output will consist of a single line containing the required sum. Errors in inputting or outputting the numbers in the required format will make a correct solution give a Wrong Answer also!
