 


Problem description.
Lex Luthor is a genius, albeit evil. Vertex Cover is an NP-hard problem. Lex Luthor's father, Lionel, is abusive. But even he knows that Lex cannot solve such a hard problem. He gives Lex an easier problem. Given the fact that in the graph G given to Lex, the Vertex-Cover has size strictly less than k or strictly greater than 2k, for a given integer k. Help poor Lex to tell the answer.


Input
The first line contains 3 integers, the number of vertices, n, the number of edges, m and the number, k.


m lines follow, with 2 integers, u and v denoting an edge between u and v.



Output
For each test case, print "Case 1" is the Vertex Cover is lesser than k and "Case 2" if it is the other case.


Constraints

n<=1e5
m<=1e6
k is non zero
1<=u,v<=1e5


Example
Input:
6 6 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 6
6 1
Output:
Case 2
 

Explanation
Example case 1.The minimum vertex cover is of size 3, hence Case 2
