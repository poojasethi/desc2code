 Mr. Voldemort is a vicious criminal who intends to rob Azkaban. Azkaban is a country consisting of N cities which can be represented as a tree. But Dumbledore's Army (also known as the D.A.) were upto the task of stopping him. Azkaban had one highway which used to connect the cities lying at maximum distance from each other in the whole country i.e No other pair of cities were further apart from each other than these two. To maximise the safety of Azkaban, D.A. placed guards in each city lying on the highway. This highway was also called ‘The Line of Fire’.  
 There could possibly be many unordered pair of cities lying at maximum distance from each other, but there was only one ‘Line of Fire’ that lied between two cities. Which two cities does the line of fire lie between, Voldemort didn't know that but he did know that it lied between cities at maximum distance from each other. So to avoid risk, he decided to not rob any city that would surely lie on the ‘Line of Fire’ irrespective of which two cities the highway was laid between. Your task is to tell him how many such cities exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of cities in Azkaban. The second line contains N-1 space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting that there is an connection between the i^th and the A[i]^th city. Also note that Ai will always be less than i.


Output

For each test case, output a single line containing the number of cities that Mr. Voldemort should avoid visiting.


Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 20
2 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
0 ≤ Ai < i


Example
Input:
2
2
0
3
0 1

Output:
2
3

Explanation
Example case 1: In the first test case, Azkaban has just 2 cities with a path between them. So there is just one way of picking two cities at maximum distance from each other. Hence the Line of Fire will always pass through both these cities.
