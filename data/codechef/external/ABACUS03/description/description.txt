 
Geek Sundaram lives in Geek City. As he is an ardent coder, he never gets to go out and leads a sedentary lifestyle. One day he realises he is getting fat and decides to something about it.
He decides to go jogging every morning.
Geek City is a rectangular city with M X N grids. Each grid can be occupied by a building or can be empty. Occupied grids are marked using '#' and empty grids are denoted by '*'.
The residents of Geek city can travel through any grid but the Mayor of Geek City has decreed that residents should not jog inside buildings. From a grid, Geek can go left, right, up or down
if there is a grid in that direction.
Naturally, Geek Sundaram has to jog along a path of empty grids. The length of a path is the number of grids present in that path. Also, Geek city is constructed such that, while jogging along a path of empty grids, one will not
revisit the same grid again without changing his/her direction.
Can you help Geek find the length of the longest path he can jog along?
