Problem text...
Many persons are familiar with the Roman numerals for relatively small
numbers. The symbols i, v, x, l and c represent the decimal values 1, 5, 10, 50 and
100 respectively. To represent other values, these symbols, and multiples where
necessary, are concatenated, with the smaller valued symbols written further to the
right. For example, the number 3 is represented as "iii", and the value 73 is
represented as "lxxiii". The exceptions to this rule occur for numbers having units
values of 4 to 9, and for tens values of 40 or 90. For these cases, the Roman
numerals representations are "iv" (4), "ix" (9), "xl" (40) and "xc" (90). So the
Roman numeral representations for 24,39,44,49 and 94 are xxiv, xxxix, xliv, xlix and
xciv respectively.
The preface of many books have pages numbered with Roman numerals,
starting with "i" for the first page of the preface, and continuing in sequence. Assume
books with pages having 100 or fewer pages of preface. How many i, v, x, l and c
characters are required to number the pages in the preface? For example, in a five
page preface we'll use the Roman numerals i, ii, iii, iv and v, meaning we need 7 i
characters and 2 v characters.

Input
Input description...
The input will consists of a sequence of integers in the range 1 to 100,
terminated by a zero. For each integer, excepts the final zero, determine the number
of different types of characters needed to number the prefix pages with Roman
numerals

Output
