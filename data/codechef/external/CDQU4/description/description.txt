 
As we all know, a substring is a contiguous subsequence of characters of a word. For example, the substrings of the word cat would be c,a,t,ca,at,cat.  
Given a String  S composed of only lower case characters, and a substring  X  also of lower case characters, your job is to remove all occurrences of X from S .    For example, if the String is “banana” and the substring is an, the resulting String would be “ba”.                                                                                                       If the resulting String has zero length, print “0” (without quotes).

 

Input
The first Line of Input will contain an Integer T, Denoting the number of Test Cases. The next 2T  Lines will contain two Strings  S and X, alternatively.

Output
For each test case, print the resulting String on a new line.

Constraints
Should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have. Format it like:

1 ≤ |S| ≤ 15 (30 Points)
1 ≤ |S| ≤ 1000 (70 Points)
1 ≤ |X| ≤ |S| 

 

Example
Input:
2bananaanlolwutlolwutlolwutlol
Output:
bawutwutwut
 

Explanation
Removing all occurrences of ‘an’ from ‘banana’ results in ‘ba’.     Similarly, removing all occurrences of ‘lol’ from ‘lolwutlolwutlolwut’ results in ‘wutwutwut’.
 
The Input and Output Format are to be followed STRICTLY. It is advised to use BufferedReader for this problem.
