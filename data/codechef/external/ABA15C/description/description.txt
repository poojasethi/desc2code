 Problem Description:
"What is a lobby boy? A lobby boy is completely invisible, yet always in sight. A lobby boy remembers what people hate. A lobby boy anticipates the client's needs before the needs are needed. A lobby boy is, above all, discreet to a fault. Our guests know that their deepest secrets, some of which are frankly rather unseemly, will go with us to our graves. So keep your mouth shut, Zero. "
              -M.Gustave
Gustave is fond of cakes. Gustave's birthday is falling soon and so Mr.Zero thinks of gifting him N cakes. ( N is the age of M.Gustave ). Zero plans to get some cakes everyday so that he could collect N cakes before M.Gustave's birthday. Assume that the Cakes are hybrid varieties and so are not perishable .Zero decides to buy at-least one cake everyday. He has to collect N cakes within H days .( H being the number of days remaining for Gustave's birthday). But he should not finish collecting the Cakes before Lth day because Zero suspects M.Gustave will find out his birthday present.
Zero can collect the Cakes in many ways. Find the number of all possible ways in collecting the Cakes .
Note:Print the output mod 10e9 + 7 

Input
The first line consists of an integer ‘T’, the number of test cases.’T’ test cases follow:
Each  test case consists of a single line containing three integers N and L and H


Output
For each test case ,output a single line containing  the number of possible ways of collecting the cakes

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ N ≤ 500
1≤L≤ H≤N


Example
Input:
1
4  2 3

Output:
6


Explanation
Example case 1. One possible way of collecting the cakes is
(2,1,1)
ie two cakes on the first day and one cake for the next two days.
Similarly the remaining possible ways are
(1,2,1) (1,1,2) (1,3) (3,1) (2,2) 
note  : (4) and (1,1,1,1) is not a valid way since he finished collecting before the 2nd day in the former case and in the latter he took more than 3 days
