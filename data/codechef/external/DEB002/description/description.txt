 
Problem description.
 A person has to pay K amount of its debt. The amount he will get back on giving an amount of Rs. x to the bank will be as per the value of the quadratic equation a*x^2 + b* x+c for that value x.
Now he wants to pay all his debts so he wants to know the least non-negative value x (i.e. x ≥ 0) that can help him getting amount ≥ K from the bank to pay his debts. Help him find that least value x.
Print -1 if no such value exists.


Input
Input description.

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases is as follows."
 Next line contains the values  a, b, c and the value of Kwhich is the amount he has to pay

 

Output
Output description.

For each test case, output a single line containing the least value of x

 

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 5 * 10^5
1 ≤ a,b,c ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ K ≤ 10^10
