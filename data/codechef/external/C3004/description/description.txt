A mathematician wants to create a calculator, he wants to add an extra feature which displays the number of digits. Now we want you to help the mathematician 
in finding the number of digits of the given expression.

NOTE:
1.) Mathematician uses only !,*,/,^ operators. 
2.) Since ! being an unary operator, second number is assigned as 0. i.e,. 5!0 is to find number of digits of factorial(5).
3.) In case of division we want you to display only the number of digits of integer part.

Input
Input consists of an expression, having two integers(


Output
Output should display the number of digits of the given expression.
