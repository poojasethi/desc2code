An integer is said to be a palindrome if it is equal to its
reverse. For example, 79197 and 324423 are palindromes. In this task
you will be given an integer N, 1 = N = 1000000. You must find
the smallest integer M = N such that M is a prime number and M is a
palindrome.
For example, if N is 31 then the answer is 101.

Input
A single integer N, (1 = N = 1000000), on a single line.

Output
Your output must consist of a single integer, the smallest prime
palindrome greater than or equal to N.

Example
Input:
31

Output:
101
