Utkarsh was recently setting a problem on trees. So he wanted to generate trees of N nodes by his program using the following procedure. 

All the nodes are aded one by one to the tree.
1 is added first as the root of the tree.
2 is added and 1 is made the parent of 2.
For every node i which is to be added next, one of i-1 or i-2 is seleclted randomly (eqiuprobably) and is made the parent of i.


He now wants to know the Expected Height of this tree. Height of a tree is the maximum number of edges on the path from root to any node of the tree. 

Input

The first line conatins the number of test cases T.
T lines follow.
Each line contains the number of nodes in the tree N.


Output

For each test case print the Expected Height of the tree. Your output should have at most 10^-6 absolute error.


Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10^6
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6


Example
Input:
2
2
3

Output:
1.000000
1.500000

Explanation
There is only one tree possible {1-2} with height = 1
Two trees are possible: {1-2,1-3} with height = 1, {1-2,2-3} with height = 2. Therefore Expected height = 1.5
