Shubham recently learned the order in strings.
Now, he has two strings s1  and  s2  of the equal size and Shubham wants to compare those two strings lexicographically.
Help Shubham with the strings comparison.

Note:
 Letters are case insensitive. 


 

Input

First line contains a integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each test case contains two strings of equal size in two separate lines.
 

Output

For each test case,

If s1 < s2, print "first".

If s1 > s2, print "second".

If s1=s2, print "equal".

in separate lines.



Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10^2
1 ≤ Length of the string ≤ 500

Example
Input:
2
abc
acb
AB
ba

Output:
first
first
