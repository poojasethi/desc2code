Crick and Watson was the duo who discovered the Double Helix model of the DNA with its "AT GC" pairing. Now while they were working on their project, they came across an intriguiging problem. The problem was that they found many combinations of the "AT"s and "GC"s in the DNA of the same organism. To their relief, this list was exhaustive. And now, they are stuck with the problem to construct the complete DNA of the organism from the combinations that they found. The problem is that, the combinations that they found ARE be a proper subset of the master DNA Model. So now, your job is to help the legendary duo in constructing the master DNA of the organism from the given combinations. The constraint being that the length of the master DNA model should be minimum.


Input

The first line of the input would consist of the number of test cases (within 1 and 20) followed by a blank line. The first line of each test case would consist of the number of "ATGC" Combination strings (not exceeding 20 and atleast 2) followed by the combination strings on each newline. Finally, there is a blank line between each two consecutive test cases. Consider that all the string input is in UPPERCASE. The input is in the priority order i.e. the importance order of the combination strings. Consider the order of importance of the combination string input ONLY if you get two master DNA strings of the same length.



Output

For the output, the master DNA model for each test case is expected on a newline. The output is also expected in UPPERCASE only.


Sample Input:
