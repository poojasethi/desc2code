Help!! Goku is facing a VERY HARD problem!!
Goku is finally back after his long training schedule. To make his kids- Gohan and Goten happy, he brought a big chocolate, weighing ‘W’ kilos. On arrival he came to know that while he was away, Gohan and Goten developed a new love for even numbers.

You need to tell if the chocolate can be divided in the way he wants.
