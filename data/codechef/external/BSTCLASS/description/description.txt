The end semester examinations have just been evaluated. The statisticians of the institute are not putting their brains to decide which class is the best of the college. 

There are T classes in the college. Each class has exactly N students. The statisticians have decided that the best class is the one in which the difference between the maximum marks obtained and the minimum marks obtained is the least. 

They have collected the data of each class. They now want you to calculate quickly the difference of maximum and minimum marks of each class.

 

Input
The first line of input is T N separated by a space. Then T lines follows. Each line has exactly N integers denoting the marks obtained by the students of that class. All numbers are space separated.
 

Output
For each class, output the difference between the maximum and the minimum marks.
 

Constraints
T≤50
1≤N≤100
0 ≤ marks obtained by any student ≤100

 

Example
Input:
2 5
2 4 5 1 3
0 100 90 80 70

Output:
4
100

 

Explanation
Here there are 2 classes with 5 students each.
Class 1. The maximum mark is 5 and the minimum is 1. Hence the difference is 5-1 =4.
Class 2. The maximum mark is 100 and the minimum is 0. Hence the difference is 100-0 =100.
Note: Do NOT ask for inputs by printing “Enter the value of N” etc. The judge is automated and will give you inputs automatically. Similarly, don’t write “The output is __”. Just print the result.
