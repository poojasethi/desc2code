Pajama and his friends were roaming in their neighbourhood fair when they came across an interesting game stall. The game was simple. There were to be T turns.In each turn, all the players would be given a target number N and K tickets numbered from 1 to K. In each turn, they would first have to return a subset of tickets such that the numbers on the tickets sum to N. The number of tickets left unused will be added to their score. Every turn starts with a fresh set of tickets (Thus at the start of every turn, the player has all the tickets numbered from 1 to K). If there is no such subset, then the score for that turn will be -1.Now the stall-owner tells them that there is an entry fee, but if their total score is more than a certain value, then he will let them enter for free. Pajama suspects that the stall-owner is trying to trick them and wants to know the maximum score possible for each round. Help him! 

Input
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of turns. The descriptions of the turns follow. Each turn is described in one line by two space separated integers N and K


Output
For each turn, output the maximum possible score. The output for each test case should consist of a single integer denoting the maximum score possible for that round or -1 as mentioned in the problem statement. 


Constraints

 T ≤ 10^5 
 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^12 
 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^5 


Example
Input:
2
4 3
7 3

Output:
1
-1


Explanation
In the first turn, Pajama has to return tickets numbered 1 and 3. He is left with 1 ticket. In the next turn, there is no subset of tickets which sums to 7.
