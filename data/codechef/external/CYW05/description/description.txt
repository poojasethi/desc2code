Obtaining the mirror image of a string or a number has been few basic examples we did in our childhood. Lets extend this to the a new level. Write a program to obtain the mirror image of a 2D string array about two perpendicular lines passing from the mid point divides the lines into two equal halves.
Note: Apply the required constraint.


Example

Input

Bcdef
Cdefg
