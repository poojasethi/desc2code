 
Problem description.
An array of n integers is given in which we should select an equilibrium number.the equilibrium number is the number for which the sum of numbers left to the equilibrium number in the array is equal to the sum of elements to the right.If equilibrium number does not exist print 'NO EQUILIBRIUM' without quotes

Input
Input description.

First line of input contains an integer T denoting number of test cases
First line of each test case contains an integer n denoting number of elements in array
next line contains n space separated integers of array



Output
Output description.

For the test case output k represents the equilibrium element of the given array
If there exists no equilibrium element display a message saying  NO EQUILIBRIUM

Constraints

1 ≤ T,n ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ array element ≤ 10^9

 

Example
Input:
2
6
7 2 4 5 1 3
4
23 32 12 4
Output:
4
NO EQUILIBRIUM
 

Explaination:


In the given example the sum of all the elements to the left of 4 is 7+2=9.And the sum of all the elements to the right of 4 is 5+1+3=9 these two are equal so the equilibrium element is 4
