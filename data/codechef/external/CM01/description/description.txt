Sircar is considered to be one of the greatest magicians of all time and you have a chance to get a lucky ticket to his show! Sircar shows you one of his most divine tricks of magical illusion. The trick is as follows:
He has 2 decks of cards, deck A and deck B. Number of cards in deck A is N and number of cards in deck B is M. Deck A has cards numbered from 1 to N, while deck B has cards numbered from N+1 to N+M. He shuffles both the deck of cards pretty well, so we can be sure that no two adjacent cards have absolute difference less than 2. Now he shows you the cards of each deck one by one, i.e. , one card from deck A and one card from deck B. He keeps showing them till both the deck have cards. Once one of the decks is out of cards, it is replaced by infinite cards having the value 0. Now the cards are continued to be shown in the given fashion until one of the deck goes out of cards and this is the point where the magic trick ends.
At this point, Sircar turns to you and asks, "Can you tell me the sum of the differences of every two cards that I have shown you during the magic trick?". As a brilliant mathematician and observer that you are, you need to answer his queries efficiently, so that you don't lose out on the chance to see the BIG MAGIC TRICK!
Note: For every round, difference = value of card of deck B - value of card of deck A.
Note:The input is very large. Don't use slow I/O methods like cin/cout 

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
Each of the T lines that follow have two space separated integers, N and M.

Output
For every test case, print out the answer as required. (Sum of difference can be negative too!)

Constraints

1 <= T <= 10^6
3 < N <= 10^8
3 < M <= 10^8


Example
Input:
2
4 6
6 4

Output:
35
13

Explanation
Example case 1.
Let us assume the deck A after shuffling will be the 3,1,4,2 and deck B will be 6,8,5,9,7,10. Let us see how the cards are shown and answer is calculated :

card from A = 3, card from B = 6, difference = 3
card from A = 1, card from B = 8, difference = 7
card from A = 4, card from B = 5, difference = 1
card from A = 2, card from B = 9, difference = 7

Now A is replaced by infinite cards of value 0.

card from A = 0, card from B = 7, difference = 7
card from A = 0, card from B = 10,difference = 10

Sum of differences is : 3 + 7 + 1 + 7 + 7 + 10 = 35.
