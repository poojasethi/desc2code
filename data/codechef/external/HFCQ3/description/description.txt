Pankaj, the right arm fast bowler bowls B regular balls and at most N free-hit balls due to his inconsistent line and length. Now, If a batsman scores 0 runs of a ball, then the ball is considered to be  a 'dot ball'. The batsman can either play a single ball bowled as a dot ball, or may score 1, 2, 4 or 6 runs from it. This scoring principle is same for both the regular balls as well as for the free-hit balls. The cricket match can end due to one of the following reasons. 

Either there are no regular balls remaining (irrespective of the number of free-hit balls remaining).
Or the batsman scores 100 or more runs(irrespective of the number of regular balls or 'no-balls' remaining).


 The batting side wins the game if the batsman scores 100 or more runs. Also, since the batsman is a power hitter, he never plays three continuous regular balls as dot balls. Three regular balls are considered continuous even if there are free-hit balls bowled in between them. The free-hit balls although offer a good opportunity to the batsman to score runs but they are actually served as penalty on the part of bowler and hence, not taken into consideration of counting them as a regular ball. For example, if the bowler delivers the following sequence of balls i.e [regular ball][regular ball][free-hit ball][regular ball]. Then, it is not possible to score zero runs of all the three regular balls, irrespective of the runs scored from the free-hit balls between them.
Find the number of ways in which the batting side wins the game. Since the answer can be too large, print it modulo 10^9 + 7. 

Note

Do not confuse with actual rules of cricket like extra runs for no ball. Only the rules stated in the problem statement are valid.


Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers i.e B and N denoting the number of regular balls and free-hit balls respectively. 


Output

For each test case, print the number of ways in which he can win the game modulo 10^9 + 7

 

Constraints


1 ≤ T ≤ 30
1 ≤ B ≤ 200
0 ≤ N ≤ 100


 

Example
Input:
1
17 0
Output:
18
 

Explanation
For the test case, the possible ways of winning are either scoring 6 runs out of all the 17 balls, or scoring 4 runs of 1 of the balls, and 6 runs out of the rest of them.
