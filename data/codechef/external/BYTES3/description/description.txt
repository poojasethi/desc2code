Problem description.
 Design Pro consists of multiple domains like web designing, animations and graphic designing. This event attracts a large number of participants each year where they compete to prove their creative mettle for designing. Here, a participant is required to make a figure of mountain on a hypothetical Photoshop Software. This Photoshop has only two tools in it, one draws “/” and the other draws “\”. You will be given N, number of times each tool is used. You have to output number of figures of mountain possible.
E.g. N=2
Then, the number of figures of mountains possible is 2
/\/\

Input
There is a single positive integer T on the first line of input. It stands for the number of cases to follow.  Each case consists of a number N, the number of time each tool was used.

Output
Output consists of T lines, each line has an integer representing the number of figures of mountain possible. The answer has to be printed modulo 1000000007.

Constraints
1<=T<=1000
1<=N<=1000000
The sum of all N in an input file will be no more than 3 x 10^8.


Example
Input:
3
