Malcolm is having a special deck of cards with him. Each card has some value that are just powers of two.Each value may occur any number of times.His friend gives him a challenge to find the number of non-negative integers that can be formed as a sum of some values from the deck of cards.

Help Macolm with this challenge.


Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of cards. The second line contains N space-separated integers  denoting the values present on each card.


Output

For each test case, output a single line containing required answer.


Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 50
Each card will contain powers of two between 1 and 2^50 inclusive.


Example
Input:
2
2
1 2
4
1 1 1 1

Output:
4
5


Explanation
Example case 1.One can make 0 (without using any cards), 1 (using 1) ,2 (using 2),3 (using 1 and 2) as sums . so the answer is 4.
