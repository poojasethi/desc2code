Little Ron of Byteland was poor at mathematics. He always used to get zero marks in mathematics test. One evening when he showed his result to his father, his father scolded him badly. So, he thought if zeroes were not there in this world how good the world would have been. The next day he was given an assignment by his mathematics teacher to add two numbers. He tried to solve the assignment by assuming that zero does not exist, i.e. he removed all the zeroes from the numbers x and y and then added them. If x + y = z  remains correct after removing zeroes from it then Ron's assumption was correct, otherwise he was wrong. 

Input
The first line of the input contains t, the number of test cases. t lines follow each containing two integers x and y to be added. The two numbers don’t have leading zeroes. 

Output
For each test case, if Ron’s assumption is correct, print "YES" (without quotes), otherwise print "NO"(without quotes).

Constraints
1 <= t <= 100  1 <= x, y <= 10^9

Example
Input:
1
205 402
Output:
YES
