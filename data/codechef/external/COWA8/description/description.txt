A prime number is one which is divisible by exactly two distinct positive integers. A twin-prime is a pair of two prime numbers such that the difference between them is 2.
Your task is simple given an integer n, you have to tell the count of twin-prime pairs in the range 1 to n both inclusive.

Input

First line contains T, number of test cases.
Next T lines contains an integer n each.

 

Output
Print a single number for each case, the total number of twin-prime pairs in the given range.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10^6
1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6
