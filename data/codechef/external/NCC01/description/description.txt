Naman has decided to go to a temple today. The path to this unique temple has exactly N steps with each step having a number A associated with it. The value of A-1 for a particular step denotes the maximum number of steps that one can skip and reach the A^th step from the current position. But in doing so, energy is reduced drastically.
Suppose Naman goes from step J1 to step J2 and  the numbers associated with these 2 steps are A1 and A2 respectively, the amount by which Naman's energy decreases is  (A2-A1).
Help Naman find the minimum starting energy so that he can reach the top of the temple.

Input : 
First line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
First line of every test case contains an integer N denoting the number of steps.
The second line contains N space separated integers denoting the numbers associated with each step.

Output :
For each test case, print the required result in a single line.

Constraints :
1 ≤ T*N ≤ 10^5 
1 ≤ Ai ≤ 10^5 

Example :
Input:
1
2
1  6
Output:
5

Explanation :
Naman's energy decreases by 5 when going from step 1 to 2. Therefore minimum energy required is 5.
