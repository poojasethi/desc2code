You have been given a 4x4 board which consists of integers from 1 to 50. A two player game is played on this board with the following rules :


The first player can pick any number from the board, this is added to his personal total.
Now the next person can only pick a number that was adjacent to the number picked by the earlier player. (Two cells are adjacent if they share a side). If all the adjacent cells are empty, the player can pick a number from any cell.
The game ends when all the numbers have been picked from the board, i.e. in exactly 16 moves.



You task in this problem is given a board configuration, return the maximal difference in the personal totals of player 1 and player 2 , assuming they play optimally.


Input
The first line of input would consist of a single integer 'T' denoting the number of test cases, T < 1000. This is followed by 4T lines , where each set of 4 lines describe the board configuration with space separated integers. Each test case would be separated by a new line.

Output
You have to output a single integer denoting the maximal difference in the personal totals of player 1 and player 2 that is possible.


Example

Input:
2
1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1

1 1 1 1
1 1 5 1
1 1 2 1
1 1 1 1

Output:
