 
Noyal wants ‘n’ papers for his event ‘Matrix’. He went to Roy Brothers Shop and found many piles of papers there. The shopkeeper told him that the ith pile contains i^3 papers and costs Rs. i and immediately asked him to take all the alternate piles starting from the last pile to the 1st or 2nd pile (depending on no. of piles being odd or even respectively) to meet his requirements.
Now Noyal took all the alternate piles, kept them together in a bag and started counting the papers. He found out that there were exactly ‘n’ papers and was amazed by the shopkeeper’s calculation.
Now being a part of MNTC, he wants to show his expertise too, help him determine exactly how much money is he supposed to pay the shopkeeper.

 

Input
First line contains the no. of test cases ‘t’. t lines follow. Each test case contains 1 line having the no. of papers ‘n’. It is guaranteed that ‘n’ will always be equal to the sum of the alternate piles.
 

Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the amount Noyal should pay to the shopkeeper.
