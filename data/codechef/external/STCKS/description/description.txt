 

Rohan and Kshitij are playing a game on a grid made of n horizontal and m vertical sticks.
An intersection point is any point on the grid which is formed by the intersection of one horizontal stick and one vertical stick.
In the grid shown below, n = 3 and m = 3. There are n + m = 6 sticks in total. There are n·m = 9 intersection points.

     d  e   f
a --|---|---|--
b --|---|---|--
c --|---|---|--

These are 9 intersection points :
(a,d), (a,e), (a,f)
(b,d), (b,e), (b,f)
(c,d), (c,e), (c,f)

The rules of the game are very simple. The players move in turns. Rohan is the inventor of the game, so he makes the first move. During his move, a player must choose any remaining intersection point and remove from the grid all sticks which pass through this point. A player will lose the game if he cannot make a move (i.e. there are no intersection points remaining on the grid at his move).
Assume that both players play optimally. Who will win the game?


Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
Each line contains 2 space separated integers n,m denoting no.of horizontal and vertical sticks respectively.

Output
For each test case, output a single line containing Rohan if he won the game else print Kshitij".
