 Kewal just returned from school where he learned that
“if the last digit of a number is divisible by 2,then it is an even number.”
However he forgot that this property holds only for integers.Anyways to keep him happy, we would consider his ideology for floating point numbers as well.
Thus we would have

 
Thus we would have
12.6 as even(last digit even(6))
12.7 as odd(last digit odd(7))
12.70 as odd(last digit odd(7)) 
as 12.7 is same as 12.70 (discarded zeroes)
Following his ideology, your task is to write a program to check whether the entered floating point  numbers are even or odd.

Input
A single line containing the number of test cases T.
T lines follow each containing a single floating point number F for each test case.

Output
 T lines specifying even or odd in order of test cases.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10
The total length of floating point number including the decimal point should be |F| ≤ 20


Example

Input
5
2.004
345.10
555.55
26.324
72.09

Output
even
odd
odd
even
odd
