 In Ancient Greece, Athenians and Spartans are two well known warring Tribes. One the occasion on Carnea, the two warring tribes come and celebrate the festival together. For the festival, the two have to stand in a line of length n (the n people will consist of both Spartans and Athenians without any restriction on number of athenians and spartans) and honor the Greek gods. But Spartans, being jealous of Athenians,  decided that they will always stand in contiguous groups of length L smaller than their sacred no. k (except 1) and also being coprime to it. Note: There can be multiple such contiguous groups in a line. However Athenians have no such demand and they can stand in whatever way they like. One day our Athenian Hero Aditya the D A /\/ G E R O U $ :P heard of this plan of Spartans and decided to count the total no of ways in which the line can be formed and announce it publicly during the festival to show them the knowledge of Athenians. But as you know he is lazy and busy playing CS your task is to help him determine the number of ways the line can be formed.

Input:
The input consist of t testcases. Each testcase consist of two integers n and k separated by space.

Output:
Output the total no of ways to arrange the Spartans and Athenians int the line.

Constraints:
1 <= T  <=10, 
1 <=  N  <= 50, 
1 <=  K  <= 10 



Sample Input : 

1
3 5



Sample Output :
