Two employees of a multinational company plan a conspiracy against the management . The major problem in their plans to take place is regular and secret communication. One of them comes up with a   
common but insecure method of encrypting text .What he does is to permute the letters of the alphabet. In other words, each letter of the alphabet is consistently replaced in the text by some other 
letter. To ensure that the encryption is reversible, no two letters are replaced by the same letter.You have been appointed by management to decrypt several encoded lines of text, assuming that each line uses a different set of replacements, and that all words in the decrypted text are from a dictionary of known words.


Input

The first line of the input consists of the number of test cases (within 1 and 50) followed by a blank line. The test case consists of a line containing an integer 'n', followed by 'n' UPPERCASE words, one per line, in alphabetical order. These 'n' words compose the dictionary of words which may appear in the decrypted text.
Following the dictionary is the input text. There are no more than 1,000 words in the dictionary. No word exceeds 16 letters.
The encrypted lines contain only UPPERCASE letters and spaces and do not exceed 80 characters in length. Finally every test case is separated by a blank line.


Output

Decrypt each line and print it to standard output. If there are multiple solutions, any one will do. If there is no solution, replace every letter of the alphabet by an asterisk.
