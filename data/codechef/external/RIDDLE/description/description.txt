Â Mr. A believes that if debugging is the process of removing bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in. Thus, Mr. A handed a code (which prints the answer to a riddle) to Mr. Y (who is one of his assists). The code is having '3' bugs.
The riddle goes like this:
    When one does not know what it is, then it is something; but when one knows what it is, then it is nothing.
A expects Y to come up with the correct code. The code gives a one word answer for the riddle: no characters added/removed. Y is busy for the evening as he has to attend his college's tech event plinth. So, he needs your help and has passed you the following C code : 


#define inam aaaaa(e,n,i,g,m,a)
#define aaaaa(p,l,i,n,t,h) i##l##h##t
#define kill aaaaaaa(s,t,u,p,i,d)
#define aaaaaaa(c,a,s,i,n,o) c##s##a##i
#define bug aaaaaaaa(c,h,a,r,i,t,y)
#define aaaaaaaa(m,u,n,g,e,r,i) m##u##n##g
#define aaaaaa ({bug * a={aaa(52),aaa(49),aaa(44),aaa(44),aaa(4C),aaa(45),aaa(0)};kill(a);})
#define aaa(y) 0x##y
inam(){aaaaaa;}

You have to debug it and submit the corrected code as plain text in the space below. Remember that any unwanted space added or removed might result in a wrong answer.
Y, using his experience, says there will be no need of adding/deleting any lines of code. He also suggested that gcc on Linux would be your best friend. He is against using any online compiler. As there is no sample input and output, there is no need to compile and test the code in the editor.
