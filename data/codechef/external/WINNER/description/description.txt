LuckyLand is a very lucky country. There are many state sanctioned lotteries and every citizen wins it at least once. Until every person wins it once, none can win it again. Winners are selected in the following manner: If it has a population of N, numbered from 1 to N, starting from a random number P, every second person wins the lottery in the  round. In the next round, the lottery winning starts from where it left in the first round itself, but those who won in the first round aren't considered and so on, until only one person remains.The people are arranged in a loop like manner where the first person comeKrumanal is a curious mathematician and wants to know, who the last person in each case will be; Can you help him out?s after the N^th person.

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of every test case is N, the number of houses Krumanal has to deliver pizza to. Details of N houses follow. 
Each test case contains 2 space separated integers N and P.

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing a single integer denoting the last person.


Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ P,N ≤ 10^9


Example
Input:
2
3 1
10 3
Output:
3
7
 

Explanation
Input test case 2:
Consider the first example

i)

1 2 3

as it starts from 1, 2 receives the lottery first;
The leaves 

1 3

the next person, 3 is skipped, and 1 receives the lottery making 3 the last person.

ii)

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

It starts from 3, and all second people receive the lottery, giving us;

1 2 3 5 7 9

after 10,

1 is skipped and the process continues:

1 3 7

again 1 is skipped and we get as 3 wins:

1 7  

now the cycle starts from 7, hence its skipped and 1 wins the lottery.

This leaves our answer, 7
