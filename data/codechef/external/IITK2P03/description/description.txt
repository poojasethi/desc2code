This is the story of Chaapu, who is off on a business trip to New York, and takes your advice on how to come up with algorithmic solutions for his day to day problems.Â 
Well you know how it is customary to "bring" things from the US to India, as they are apparently cheaper. Our mature Chaapu has bought N gifts and parcels for every member of his family. His return flight to India  is in a few days, and as the luggage load will be huge, he has decided to send these gifts and parcels through a courier service.
The courier service has M channels, each of which can be used to send only one parcel. However, each channel has different delivery time for each of the gifts/parcels. To make sure that most of the gifts have arrived by the time Chaapu gets home, he has decided that atleast K gifts should get delivered before he takes the return flight.
You are given a matrix A with A[i][j] representing the delivery time for gift/parcel i through channel j. You have to output the minimum time T required so that at least K gifts/parcels are delivered in time T. 

Input
The first line of the input contains N, M, K respectively.Rest of the N lines contain M integers each denoting the time required as explained above.

Output
Output the minimum time required T as mentioned.

Constraints


1 <= N,M <= 100
1 <= A[i][j] <= 10^12
1 <= K <=M,N



Example

Input:
2 3 1
1 2 3
3 2 1

Output:
1

Explanation

We can use the first channel to send the first gift.
