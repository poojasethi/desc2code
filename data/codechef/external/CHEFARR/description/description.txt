Problem Statement
 Chef has an array of N numbers . Chef wants to know the number of ways to divide it into 3 contiguous parts such that the sum of the three parts is equal . Formally you need to find number of indices i,j such that sum of elements from 1 to i-1 = sum of elements from i to j = sum of elements from j+1 to N .


Input
The first line contains an integer N . Then the next line has N integers denoting the array 'A'.

Output
A single integer denoting the number of ways to split the array into 3 parts with equal sum.


Constraints

1 <= N <= 5*10^5
0 <= |A[i]| <= 10^9

 Note : The numbers might be negative .
