Yaar Kumar while attending the Microprocessor class, did get to know about the AND operation. He found this bit wise operation very boring and soon felt asleep during the Lab. Professor  Chef saw this and to make Yaar feel the AND operation interesting, gave him a question.
Given are two numbers, A and B. He needs to find the maximum number that is possible by ANDing  x and  y, where A ≤ x < y ≤ B.


Input

First line contains T, the number of test cases.
The next line contains 2 space separated integers, A and  B.


Output
Output for each case, the maximum number that is possible.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10^3
1 ≤ A < B ≤ 10^18


Example
Input:
2
1 2
1 3

Output:
0
2

Explanation
Case2: The maximum number will be  AND of 2 and 3.
