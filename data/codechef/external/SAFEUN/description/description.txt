Phineas and Ferb are busy working on a top secret project involving growth elixir in order to help their friend Baljeet win the biggest watermelon contest at the local fair. To protect their research from unauthorized access, they store all their findings inside a safe which is password protected. Phineas’s sister Candace does not approve of these inventions and has been trying to unlock the safe in order to find out and bust her brothers by showing their mom. She wasn’t making any progress until one day she accidentally heard Phineas giving instructions to his friend Isabella, on how to unlock the safe. Phineas tells Isabella two positive Integers K and S where K denotes the number of elements and S denotes the sum of all those elements. The password to the safe is the maximum product of K numbers such that the sum of all those numbers is S. Since Candace is not really good at math, she needs your help.

Note: Since the password can be too large, output the result modulo 10^9 + 7.
 

Input
First line contains a positive integer T, denoting the number of test-cases.
Each test-case contains two positive space separated integers K and S denoting the number of elements and the sum of all those elements respectively.
 

Output
For each test-case, print the output (the password of the safe) modulo 109 + 7.

 

Constraints


1 = T = 10000
1 = K = 10^18
1 = S = 10^18
