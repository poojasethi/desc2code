After a while he starts with a shuffled palindromic string. His girlfriend shuffles the same string and makes another palindrome. Again Geek finds another palindrome. This conversation goes on until they run out of palindromes in the given string. S. 
 Find the number of strings that occur in the conversation between them.
 P.S. In order to maintain a strong relationship the conversation must last for a long time. 
 If there are no such strings print -1 

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a string S 

 

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing the number of distinct palindromic anagrams in the given string

 

Constraints
