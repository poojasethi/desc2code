        has short time to do so. He decided to go to Islamabad through a longest path so that he can visit 
        maximum area on his way to Islamabad. 
        Write such an algorithm which finds longest path between two cities.


         


Input


         


 You will get the total number of cities 
        (0<city code<10).


 You will be given two 2D arrays. First 
        row of the first array contains codes of those cities which are directly 
        connected to the first city. The second row of the first array contains codes of 
        those cities which are directly connected to the second city and so on.


 In second array the distance between two 
        cities is placed at the 



        corresponding location as the destination city in the first array.


        Single city should not be repeated in the longest path.


Output


        The output will contain the path from source city to destination city
          with maximum distance for each source 
        and destination city.


Sample Input


        5
// number of cities


        2 3 4         
        // start of first 2D array


        1 4 5


        1 4 5


        2 3 1


        2 3


        4 9 17        
        // start of second 2D array


        4 9 13


        9 15 20


        9 15 17


        13 20


        5 3            
        // source and destination cities


        1 4


        4 3


        0


         


Sample Output


        5 2 1 4 3        
        // path from city 5 to 3 with maximum distance


        1 3 5 2 4


        4 2 5 3
