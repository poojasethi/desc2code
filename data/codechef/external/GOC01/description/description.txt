Problem Description
An online quiz is going to be held at NIT Hamirpur. Each student will be given a system which is connected to internet. Although all the systems are connected to same network, there is still varying data transfer speed among them. This can cause pages to load slower on one system than the other. The organizers do not want a participant to have an advantage over others due to this. The organizers can't increase transfer speed on a system but they can cap it. Also they want to provide maximum speed to each system.
