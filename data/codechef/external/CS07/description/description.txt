Problem text...
A dancing square is a “transparent” n x n matrix whose components are "painted"
with a uppercase x (x) or a period (.). A dancing square dances by spinning 90
clockwise or counterclockwise, and or flipping about a centered horizontal or vertical
axis
When dancing squares are dancing it can be quite challenging to determine which
are identically painted and which are distinct. Write a program which inputs an
original dancing square, then inputs one or more additional dancing squares and
determines for each one if it is identical- i.e. can be obtained from original by some
sequence of spin and/or flips, or is distinct- i.e. cannot be obtained from the original
by sequence of spins and/or flips.

Input
Input description...
The first line of standard input contains the dimension n>=1 of all dancing squares
which follow. The subsequent lines of input contain at least two dancing squares,
each preceded by blank line and consisting of n lines containing n component
characters.

Output
Output description...
For each dancing square in the standard input following the first one, output a line
containing "identical" or "distinct", indicating whether it is identical to or distinct from
the first one.

Example

Input:
3
x.x
x..
xx.
xxx
..x
x..
xxx
.. x
x. x

Output:
Square 2 is identical to square 1.
Square 3 is distinct from square 1.
