Problem description
As we all know placement season is on in NIT Durgapur and everyone wants to get their dream job. A Final year student Ravi also wants a big break. He wants to organize all his books he has in the book shelf to prepare properly by selecting the best suited books for his subjects. As he has N number of books and he doesn't know whether all of them can be accommodated in the shelf, he decides to minimize the space left after placing some of those books in the shelf. As Ravi is very lazy and he doesn’t want to do any work, he needs your help.

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. First line of each test case has two space separated integers N and C denoting the number of books and capacity of book shelf. Second line of each test case has N space separated integers denoting the array A. A[i] is denoting the space accommodated by the ith book.

Output
For each test case, output only line containing the minimum possible space left.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 5
1 ≤ N ≤ 20
0 ≤ C ≤ 10^9
1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10^9
