 
Yadav is really fond of Maths, but is terribly weak at statistics and probability. His rival, Bathla, tries to exploit this fact whenever he can. This time as he runs into Yadav, he challenges him to find the expected value of the sum of 4 numbers chosen randomly from a list of n given numbers. Now, fortunately for Yadav, he was speaking to you on his earpiece. So, he needs you to find the answer and give it to him so that he can win at this challenge.
 

Input
The first line contiains n, the number of integers present in the list.
The next line cointains n space seperated integers, ai, the numbers in the list.

Output
Give the expected value upto exactly 6 decimal places. For example, if you get your ans as 203 then print 203.000000.

Constraints

4 ≤ n ≤ 1000000
0 ≤ ai ≤ 100000000

 

Example
Input:
4
1 2 3 4

Output:
10.000000
