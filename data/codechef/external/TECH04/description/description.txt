In this problem, you are given two strings S1 and S2, your task is to determine whether one string is an anagram of the other. An anagram of a string is a string obtained by permuting the letters of a string. For example aaba and aaab are anagrams, while abcd and deba are not.


Input

You have to print "YES" if one string is an anagram of the other or "NO" otherwise.
