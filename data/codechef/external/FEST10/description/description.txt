Input

The first line contains T i.e. the number of test cases.
.
T lines follow, each line containing an integer,N


Output

For each testcase, print the round number of N in new line.

 

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10^9
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^15


Example
Input:
1
128

Output:
130


Solution

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
	 
     long  int t;
	scanf(" % lld",&t);
	
    for(i=n;i ≥ 0;i--)
	{
	    long long int n;
	   scanf(" %lld",n);
	   while(n)
	   {
	   	  n++;
	   	  n/=10;
	   }
	   printf("%lld\t",n);
	}
	return 0;
}


Steps to be followed
    1. Read the given description carefully and understand the problem.
    2. Analyze the code given in the problem and find bugs(errors) in these codes..
    3. The given code can be copied and compiled in an online compiler (Eg. ideone.com).
    4. Once the bugs are eliminated from the code, the clean code can be submitted as the solution to the problem..
    5. The solution should be a debugged version of the code provided and must satisfy the test cases to be accepted..
All the best!!
