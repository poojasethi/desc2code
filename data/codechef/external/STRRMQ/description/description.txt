String comparison is an age old concept. We have the same simple task
for you too, just expected to be performed many-many times.
Given an array A containing N strings a0,a2 ... an-1, each of length M, you are expected to handle queries of the type:
0 x y: Output the index of the lexicographically smallest string in A[x...y]. (if there is more smallest ones, pick one with smallest index)
1 x: Pop the starting letter of the string at index x (if string is empty do nothing).

 Note : IO is huge 

 Constraints : 
 N ≤ 1000
 M ≤ 1000
 Q ≤ 10^5
 T ≤ 20


Input
First line contains T (T ≤ 20), number of test cases. T test cases follows. First line contains N and M. N lines follow each containing string of length M. Number  Q follows donating number of queries. Q lines follow describing query as in problem statement.


Output
Output only answers for queries of first type
