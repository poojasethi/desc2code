 Children 
        are taught to add multi-digit numbers from right-to-left one digit at a time. 
        Many find the "carry" operation - in which 1 is carried from one digit position 
        to be added to the next - to be a significant challenge.  Your job is to 
        count the number of carry operations 
        for each of addition problem so that educators may assess their difficulty.


 


Input


Each line of input contains two unsigned 
        integers less than 10 digits.


The last line of input contains 0 0.


 


Output


For each line of input except the last 
        output the number of carry operations that would result from adding the two 
        numbers, in the format shown below.


 


Sample Input


123 456


555 555


123 594


0 0


 


Sample Output


No carry operation.


3 carry operations.
