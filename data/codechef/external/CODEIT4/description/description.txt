This year in Thapar, we introduce a new Maze race. There is a big maze of N*N, where you start from (1,1) and the goal is to reach (N,N) position. The rule says that you can only move either right or down. Also at every position there are some hurdles of different difficulty levels C. You want to minimize the total difficulty of the route that you will take to reach your goal.


Input
 The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. 

The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
Then next N lines contain N integers each, every integer is the representation of the difficulty of the hurdle at that position. (0 being the minimum)


Output

For each test case, print the total minimum difficulty of the route to reach the goal.


Constraints

 0 < T <= 10
 1 < N <= 100
 0 < Ci <= 100


Example
Input:
2
3
10 3 7
5 2 6
3 4 9
4
2 15 18 9
3 52 3 47
6 38 12 7
7 29 28 15

Output:
28
72

Explanation

Example case 1. minimum difficulty is faced in route (1,1),(1,2),(2,2),(3,2),(3,3)
Example case 2. minimum difficulty is faced in route (1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(2,3),(3,3),(3,4),(4,4)
