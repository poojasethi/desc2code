We will denote the initial empty Tic Tac Toe grid with nine dots.  
Whenever
X or O plays we fill in an X or an O in the appropriate position.  The
example below illustrates each grid configuration from the beginning to
the end of a game in which X wins.

...     X..    X.O     X.O      X.O     X.O      X.O      X.O
...     ...       ...        ...         .O.       .O.       OO.      OO.
...     ...       ...        ..X        ..X       X.X      X.X       XXX

Your job is to read a grid and to determine whether or not it could
possibly be part of a valid Tic Tac Toe game.  That is, is there a 
series
of plays that can yield this grid somewhere between the start and end of
the game?


Input

The first line of input contains N, the number of test cases.  4N-1 
lines
follow, specifying N grid configurations separated by empty lines.  

Output
For 
each 
case print "yes" or
"no" on a line by itself, indicating whether or not the configuration 
could
be part of a Tic Tac Toe game.
