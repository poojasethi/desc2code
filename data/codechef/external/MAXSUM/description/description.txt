Ramanujan is a Mathematician. One day when he was looking for a book in library, he came across a book named Formule Di Matematica. He found it interesting and started reading it. While going through the book, he found a function D which was as following:
D(< a1,a2,a3,..,an >) = |a1-a2| + |a2-a3| + ... +|an-1-an| 
where < a1,a2,a3,...,an > is a sequence of n distinct integers.Ramanujan quickly understood that the value of D would depend upon the order of integers, hence he was then interested in finding out what could possibly be the maximum value of D, given a set of Integers S.
It's given that, S = set of all possible permutation you can make with n different integers and the range of integers would be [1...n]. 
Now help Ramanujan to find the maximum value of D which can be obtained, if he tries each and every permutation from the set S as an argument for D.

Input:

There will be T ≤ 10^5 test cases. For each case there is a single line. First line contains an integer 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 which specifies the number of distinct integers. The integers are in the range [1..n].


Output:
For each test case you have to output the required answer in a single line.The output will fit in 64-bit signed integer.


Example:

Input:
2
1
2

Output:
0
1
