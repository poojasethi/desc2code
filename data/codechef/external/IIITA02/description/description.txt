 There are B balls, numbered 1 to B. The Chef is distributing all B balls among B children, giving one ball to every child. He does that iteratively. In the first pass, starting from the first ball he gives out every alternate ball, in the second pass, he gives out every third ball starting from the first remaining ball, in the kth pass, he gives out every (k+1)th ball. He does this until all the balls are distributed. You have to output the number of last ball to be distributed. 

Input
 First line contains integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. Each test case consists of a single line with the integer B.

Constraints
  0 < T ≤ 100, 0 < B ≤ 100 

Output
 A single line for each test case, with the number of the last ball to be distributed.
