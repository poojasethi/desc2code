 
Fahim is going to make a social network which is now under construction. There are two ways to make friends in social network.
 Type 1: Any person goes to his / her friend list then choose a friend and search his / her friend list (this website is under construction so friend list is public). From there he can choose a person and give him/her a friend request or go to his / her friend list and repeat this. 
 Type 2: Search a random user by typing his / her name and give him / her friend request.
 Now Fahim wants a track of friendships formed by  Type 1  and  Type 2. When two people become friends, check whether it is possible by Type 1 method. If yes, then report “Found in friend list” otherwise report “Found by random”.
As he is lazy, he is asking your help to do this job.
