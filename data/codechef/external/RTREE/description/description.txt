 You will be given a rooted tree consisting of n  nodes. All the nodes are numbered from 0 to n-1. Root of the tree is always 0.
Each node contains the value of factorial of its node number mod 10 ^9 +7. For example,if node number is 3, then it will contain 3!=6 mod  10 ^9 +7 which is equal to 6.
You will be given q queries consisting of two space separated integers a and b, both denoting the node number.
Your task is to count the number of nodes on the path from a to b whose value is divisible by 3.  

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer n denoting the number of nodes in tree. 
Then, n-1 lines follows each consisting of two space separated integers denoting the edge of the tree.
Next line contains an integer q denoting the number of queries.
Then q lines follows each consisting of two space separated integers a and b.


Output
For each test case output the required answer. 

Constraints

1 ≤ n ≤ 100000
1 ≤ q ≤ 100000
0 ≤ a,b ≤ n-1


Example
Input:
6
0 1
0 2
1 5
2 3
2 4
3
0 4
1 2
3 4

Output:
1
0
2

Explanation
Example case 1. For the first query, the path is 0->2->4 of which only 4!=24 is divisible by 3, so output is 1. For the second query,the path is 1->0->2 of which none is divisible by 3,so the output is 0.For the third query,the path is 3->2->4 of which 3!=6 and 4!=24 are divisible by 3,so the output is 2.
