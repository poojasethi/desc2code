An integer is said to be prime palindrome if it is a prime number and its reverse is same as that of the original number.
 Your task is to output the sum of all such prime palindromes lies between the range N and M (N and M both are inclusive).


Input description.

The first line of input contains an integer Tdenoting the number of test cases.
The Second line contains two integers N and M denoting the range.



Output Description:

Output is the sum of all prime palindromes lies between N and M.

 

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ M≤10^8

 

Example
Input:
1
1 101

Output:
129

 

Explanation
TestCase 1]: The prime palindromes lies between the range 1 to 101 are 2,3,5,7,11 and 101.The sum of all these numbers is 129 which is the
				output.
