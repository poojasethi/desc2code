Mr Iyer and his friend Sudhanshu have learnt today a new concept in Maths called GCD(Greatest Common Divisor) i.e, GCD for n numbers can be defined as the largest number dividing all of the n numbers.
They are solving a GCD related problem in which they are given an array of N numbers and a parameter K. they need to find the maximum size of contiguous subarray (i.e numbers in sequence) having GCD greater than or equal to K, if no subarray is possible output 0.

As Mr Iyer and his friend Sudhanshu, are new to GCD concept. they are asking for your help.

Input

First Line of input Contains two Integers N and K denoting size of array and parameter.
Second line of input contains N space seperated integers Ai, denoting the array.


Output

Output the Maximum size of contiguous subarray having GCD greater than or equal to K, otherwise output 0.


Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ K,Ai ≤ 10^6


Example
Input:

6 10
25 10 20 30 40 50

Output:

5



Explanation
Example case 1. here subarray will be (10,20,30,40,50).
