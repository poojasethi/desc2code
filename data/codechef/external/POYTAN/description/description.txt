Your task for this problem is to produce the product of two given square matrices.

Input

The first line contains the number of testcases T.

For each test case the first line contains integer N the number of rows and colums of the two square matrice.
Then you will get the first matrix. Each row of the matrix will be kept in a seprate line. All the N rows will contain N space seprated integers Ai,0 Ai,1 ... Ai,j .... Ai,N.

Then you will get the second matrix. Each row of the matrix will be kept in a seprate line. All the N rows will contain N space seprated integers Bi,0 Bi,1 ... Bi,j .... Bi,N.


 

Output
For each test case you have to print the product of the two matrices.
Print every row in a seprate line. For every row print all the elements of the row in a space seprated manner.
 

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 20
1 ≤ N ≤ 10
0 ≤ Ai,j,Bi,j ≤ 100
