Problem description
Tris (or as her parents call her Beatrice) is going through a series of training and evaluation to get into top 10 and remain in Dauntless Faction. She is currently placed 12th and will become faction-less if she fails, today. 
Four (or Tobias) gives Tris a string, consisting of 'i'(s) and 'd'(s) only. Tris has to select a number and increment it by 1 when she encounters 'i' and reduce it by 1 when she encounters 'd'. Thus calculate the final result.
There are several results possible, but Four wants the starting number and the corresponding result, such that their sum is minimum. However there is a catch, like in all Dauntless exercises, the number cannot be negative at any step.

Input
First line contains number of test cases.For each test case you have the string. given by Four to Tris

Output
Help Tris by telling her  the starting number and the corresponding result (In correct order), separated by a space. Print result for each test case in a new line.

Constraints
SubTask 1 - 70 Points

1 ≤ T ≤ 100

1 ≤ length(string) ≤ 10^3


SubTask 2 - 30 Points

T =1

1 ≤ length(string) ≤ 100


Example
Input:
1
iidiiii

Output:
0 5

Explanation
0 - 1(i) - 2(i) - 1(d) - 2(i) - 3(i) - 4(i) - 5(i)
we start with 0 (zero) and add 1 for every 'i' and subtract 1 for every 'd' , checking at each step that value does not become negative
