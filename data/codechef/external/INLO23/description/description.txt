 
NASA is building a new super-computer. For this they are designing a new OS. All the processes that are running on the computer at a time are assigned an integer by the OS, which is called  ’ factor ’. Each process has its own factor assigned to it. G(k)  is a function which gives the factor of process k.
The running processes can be represented by the nodes of a tree. If process B is a descendant of process A in the tree, then B is called the sub-process of process A and  A is called the super-process of B.At the root of the tree is Process ‘Top’. All the other processes are its sub-processes.
F(x,y) is a function which determines the performance of the super-computer. Here (x,y) is that pair of processes (y is always a sub-process of process x) where the difference between the factors of process x and process y is maximum. You are required to find maximum value of  G(x)-G(Y) .

 

Input

Each test case contains (2*N+1) integers. The first integer  represents the number of running processes. The next N integers i.e A[i] give the factors(g(i)  ) of process 1…. N. The last N integers give the super-processes of process 1….N.

If the super-process of a process is denoted by -1, it means that the process is at the root of the tree i.e. it is process ‘Top’.

Output
You are required to find G(x) - G(Y), where x and y is that pair of processes (y is always a sub-process of process of x) where the difference between the factors of x and y is maximum..
