 
Can you decode it?
Saurabh is receiving some encrypted messages. Decrypting them seems to be very easy to him. Still he is
too lazy to decode it. The message is in the form of a string with digits(1-9) and uppercase english alphabets(A-Z).
Digits imply the number of times the string following it(till the next digit) will be printed. Help Saurabh to
print the exact answer.
Note: There will not be two consecutive digits in given string.
 

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
Each contains a string consisting of digits and uppercase english alphabets.

 

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing the decoded string.

 

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ Length of the string ≤ 100000

 

Example
Input:
2
1A1B
2AB3C

Output:
AB
ABABCCC
 

Explanation
Example case 2.AB is repeated 2 times and C is repeated 3 times. Hence ABABCCC .
