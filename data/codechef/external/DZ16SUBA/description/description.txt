Utkarsh recently found an array A and a special function F(A). Function F takes input an array and gives the sum of Xor Sum of all the subsequences of the array.
Utkarsh now wants to calculate the value of function F for some sub arrays of A. He also wants to change some values of array A.
So Utkarsh has Q queries. Each query can be one of 2 following types.

1 L R : Tell the value of F( A[L..R] ). As the answer can be large, print it modulo 10^9+7.
2 V X: Make A[V] = X.

NOTE:

Xor Sum of a sequence {a1,a2,..an} is defined as a1^a2^...^an. ^ denotes bitwise Xor operation.

Sequence B is a subsequence of sequence of C if B can be created by deleting some elements of C.


A[L..R] denotes the subarray containing AL, AL+1 ,.., AR.

Array A is 1-indexed.



Input

The first line contains two integers N and Q. N is the number of elements in array A. Q is the number of queries.
Next line contains N integers denoting the array A.
Next Q lines contains the description of the queries.
Line starting with 1 denotes query of first type. The line will contain 2 more integers L and R.
Line starting with 2 denotes query of second type. The line will contain 2 more integers V and X.


Output

For each query of type 1 print the result F( A[L..R] ) mod 10^9+7


Constraints

1 ≤ N, Q ≤ 10^6
1 ≤ Ai , X ≤ 10^9
1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ N
1 ≤ V ≤ N


Example

Input:
3 4
1 2 3
1 1 3
2 3 2
2 1 2
1 1 3

Output:
12
8

Explanation
For first query answer = 1 + 2 + 3 + 1^2 + 1^3 + 2^3 + 1^2^3 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 12
For last query answer = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 + 2^2^2 = 2 + 2 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 = 8
