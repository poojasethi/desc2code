Problem Statement
Jalote just received a simple unbiaased coin from his mother and began tossing it. After playing with coin for some time, the little mathematician in him started noticing the number of times he had to toss the coin in order to see both the faces of the coin. After repeating the experiment many times, he inferred that the expected number of tosses he had to do were 3.


This made little Jalote wonder that if he had a biased coin, what should be the probability P of getting a head, if he knows that the expectation value x for the number of times he has to toss the coin in order to see both the faces of the coin.


Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The only line of each test case contains a single decimal number x(the expectation value).

Output
For each test case, output a single line containing P the required answer to the problem. If there are multiple values of P possible, output the case with least value. If no such P exists for the given input, print -1. Maximum error of 10^-6 is accepted.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 100000
0 ≤ x ≤ 1000
