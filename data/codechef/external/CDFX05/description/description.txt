 Neha went on a vacation to Dubai. She along with some of her friends planned to visit the “Burj Dubai” for shopping. Neha was very scared of commuting through lifts, so wherever she’d go, she used the staircase. Also while going upstairs, Neha had a weird habit of looking at the floor numbers and counting how many digits “1”, she came across. Unfortunately, Neha failed to climb at the top and fainted somewhere in the middle. At the hospital she could only recall the number of “1”s she had counted. Your task is now to help Neha find out the floor number where the last of the ones was counted.

Input

The number of ones Neha has counted.


Output

Output the floor number where the last of ones has been sighted. If Neha has recalled an incorrect number, then output “-1”.
 

Constraints
