Given an array a[1..n] of n numbers. You need to swap adjacent numbers exactly k times. The goal is to minimize the number of inversions after exactly k swaps.
An inversion is a pair (i, j) such that i < j and a[i] > a[j]

Input
The first line contains an integer T indicating the number of test cases.
For each test case, there are two lines in total. The first line contains two integer n and k. The second line contains n numbers describing the array.

Output
Output T lines in total. Each line should start with "Case #: " and followed by the minimum inversions after swaps. Here "#" is the number of the test case starting from 1.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10
2 ≤ n ≤ 100000
0 ≤ k ≤ 1000000
1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n


Example
Input:
3
3 3
3 2 1
3 1
1 2 3
3 2
1 2 3

Output:
Case 1: 0
Case 2: 1
Case 3: 0


Explanation
Case 1, (3 2) 1 --> 2 3 1 --> 2 (3 1) --> 2 1 3 --> (2 1) 3 --> 1 2 3.
Case 2, (1 2) 3 --> 2 1 3.  You have to make exactly k swaps.
