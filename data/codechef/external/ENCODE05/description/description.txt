Samya and Utsav are good friends. Samya claims that no one can beat him in maths especially when it comes to dealing with numbers. So Samya throws a challenge at Utsav that he will be able to do any computation within a second however difficult it is. Utsav tells him a value of N and asks him to find the smallest number such that it is co-prime to all first N natural numbers,it is a composite number and it is a square free number.Surprisingly Samya really gives the answer within a fraction of a second for whatever N Utsav asks him to do. But Utsav is not so good at Maths.So he wants you to write a program for him so that ha can verify Samyas answer. Let's see if your program can do better than Samya's brain.
