 
Khefu is a highschool student from India. She adores maths. In maths, her favorite topic is number theory. Today, she is playing with the GCD function.  What she is doing is just randomly picking up a pair of integers (x,y) and computing their GCD. She noticed that many times the  GCD(x,y)  is 1. Khefu is quite intrigued by these pairs and wanted to count them. 
 Given a upper-bound N, help khefu to count the number of pair of integers  (x,y)  such that  0 ≤ x,y < N
 and  GCD(x,y) = 1  .

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.The first and the only line of each test case contains a single integer denoting the upper-bound N as described in the problem statement. 
 

Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the value of the required count.
 

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10000
1 ≤ N ≤ 10000000

 

Example
Input:
1
3

Output:
5
 

Explanation
For the upper bound N = 3. we have exactly 5 pairs for which the GCD is 1: (0,1),(1,0),
(1,1),(1,2),(2,1)
