 
Shil has an array of N integers A1,A2....AN.He challenges you to calculate Coprime sum for this array. Coprime sum is define as Σ Σ max(i,j) * g(i,j) where i < j .
 g(i,j) will be 1 if Ai and Aj are coprime to each other else it will be 0.
max(i,j) will be defined as max(Ai,Ai+1....Aj). 
 

Input
 First line of input consists of integer N.Next line consists of N integers A1,A2....AN.
 

Output
Print the coprime sum for the given array.
