There is a grid of m*n. A person is standing at the top left corner and he need to reach the bottom right corner of the grid. That person can travel only in right and downward direction. Your job is to write a program to calculate the number of ways in which that person can reach his destination (satisfying all the restrictions).



Input
Input is a single line  containing a number of test cases T not more than 10 and first line of each test case contains the value of m (number of columns not more than 6) and second line of each test case contains the value of n(number of rows not more than 6).



Output
For each test case output is a single line containing the number of ways in which that person can reach his destination.
