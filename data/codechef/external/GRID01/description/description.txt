Raina was practicing Matrices and Determinants before his exam. He came across a question which required him to find out the number of adjacent squares for each of the squares in a grid and then sum them up. Raina tried to solve the problem but couldn’t come up with a solution. He asked his friend Sir Jadeja, who is a mathematics wizard to help him out. But even Sir Jadeja couldn’t arrive at a solution. Now Raina has turned to you for a solution. Can you help him out?

Input
The first line contains a single integer T , the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The only line of each test case contains 2 integers N and M where N and M denote the number of rows and columns respectively in the grid.

Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the sum of the number of adjacent squares for each square.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100000
1 ≤ N,M ≤ 10000
