Alice and Bob are playing a game. Alice gives Bob a string S. Then, she asks him Q queries. The positions in the string are labelled as 1, 2, 3, ..., |S| (|S| denotes the length of S). Each query is of the form [l, r]. Bob has to form a palindromic string using some of the characters at positions that lie in the range [l, r]. More formally, he can pick characters at position i such that  l ≤ i ≤ r . He can rearrange them the way he wants.  
Now, for each query Alice wants to know what is the maximum length of the string Bob can form.
Note: A string is said to be palindromic if it reads same forward or backward. For example, aa, bab are palindromic while ab, abc are not.

Input
First line of the input contains the string S. Next line contains a single integer Q which denotes the number of queries. Each of the next Q lines have two space separated integers l and r.

Output
For each test case, output a single integer which is the maximum length of a palindromic string that Bob can form in that case.

Constraints

1 ≤ |S| ≤ 2 × 10^5
1 ≤ Q ≤ 2 × 10^5
S contains only lower case English alphabets ('a'-'z')


Example
Input:
