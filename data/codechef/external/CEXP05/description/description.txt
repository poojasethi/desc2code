While having the dinner WonderKing and professor WonderMath was discussing about Ideal numbers â€“ a great topic in mathematics, WonderQueen who was not that much interested in mathematics , was listening to the discussions and was thinking only a number can be ideal, why not strings?. She asked it from her mother who is a expert in language, she replied Yes and gave an explanation to Ideal String. 
 Amicable numbers are a pair of numbers with the following property: the sum of all of the proper
divisors of the first number (not including itself) exactly equals
the second number while the sum of all of the proper divisors of the
second number (not including itself) likewise equals the first number. 
An Ideal string is a string where the index of the first
occurrence of each letter is equal to the number of
occurrences of that letter in the string.
(Assume index starts with 1).
For example:

For example the string CIOOIO is an ideal string.

1.The letter C appears only one time and index of the first occurrence of it is 1. :
2.The letter I appear two times and index of the first occurrence of it is 2. :
3.The letter O appears three times and index of the first occurrence of it is 3. :

BEECCCC is also an ideal string.

1.The letter B appears only one time and index of the first occurrence of it is 1. :
2.The letter E appear two times and index of the first occurrence of it is 2. :
3.The letter C appears four times and index of the first occurrence of it is 4. :

WonderQueen got so much interested about Ideal Strings, she wanted to explore more and more Ideal strings, So you must help her..


Input
The first line of the input file contains the number cases (<10) followed by set of numbers ( < 100,000,000) one in each new line which you have to declare amicable or not.
The first line of the input file contains the number of strings ( < 100)
followed by strings in each new line ( length of a string < 20) with only
letters od uppercase in English alphabet, that you have to check ideal or not.


Output

If a string is ideal you must print,
Yes
Else, No
