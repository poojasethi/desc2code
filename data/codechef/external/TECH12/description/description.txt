A range [L..H] is called a K-Frequent Prime range if there are atleast K primes amongst the numbers L,L+1,..,H. 

Given N and K, calculate how many subranges of the range [2..N] are K-Frequent Prime.

Input
The first line contains the number of test cases T ( ≤ 100). Each of the next T lines contains 2 integers N and K. (2 ≤ N ≤ 100000, 0 ≤ K ≤ 10000)


Output
Output T lines, one corresponding to each test case, containing the required answer.


Example

Input:
4
2 1
5 2
5 1
9 3

Output:
1
4
9
8



Note: For the first test case, the only valid subrange is [2..2], whereas for the second test case, the valid subranges are : [2..3],[2..4],[2..5],[3..5].
