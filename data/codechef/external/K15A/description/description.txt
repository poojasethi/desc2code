Sujatha, after becoming the CEO of a company, decided to grant some of his
books to his company’s employees for free! On one fine day, he asked all his 
employees to form a line and he started distributing books. Sujatha will note 
down the ID of the employee, when he gives the book.  All his employees are die-
hard fans of Sujatha, hence they started cheating by collecting more than one 
book. You have to find out the number of people who have cheated.
