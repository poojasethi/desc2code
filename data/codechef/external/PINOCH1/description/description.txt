Pinocchio is a very interesting fictional character. Each time he lies, his nose is extended by 1 cm .
Pinocchio and Lampwick are best friends. 
  But Pinocchio's habit of lying has increased manyfold nowadays which has left Lampwick really upset. As a result, he has decided to maintain a diary recording the length of Pinocchio's nose each day. For this, he asks Pinocchio some questions each day and notes down the length of his nose in centimeters at the end of the day.
For example, the diary containing entries for a week may look like: 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5
After N days of carefully analysing Pinocchio's lying habit, Lampwick wants to confront Pinocchio. But for that he needs to find out the number of days when Pinocchio lied atleast once. Can you help him out?
Being a trusting friend, Lampwick assumes Pinocchio was telling the truth on the first day.
