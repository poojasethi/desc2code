Peter is an insanely crazy maths professor. One day while giving his lectures, he suddenly hit an absurd idea of having a new seating plan for his class.
A class consists of N students. Each student can be represented by a unique identification number ID and his overall marks M. Assume all students have distinct id's in range 1 to  N.

The crazy professor defines a function P(X) as the sum of exponents of all primes in prime-factorization of X. Example P(12) = P(2^1*2^1*3^1) = 3.


Peter decided that all the students with same P(ID) have to sit together in the new seating plan as this will enhance their sincerity in the class.


For this new seating convention, he needs to rearrange the students of the class.The concentration of a permutation arrangement of N students is defined as summation of Marks[student_at_seat_no_i] * i^2 for i in 1 to N. Ivan, being his favorite student, has to devise a seating plan that maximizes the concentration by optimally arranging students in a particular permutation following the above constraint.


Note: 

The seats in Peter's class are numbered from 1 to N.
Since, the input data is heavy, it is recommended to use faster I/O for example scanf / printf in C++. 



 

Input

The first line of the input contains the number of students N present in the class
 Next N lines contains two space separated integers denoting student identification number ID and overall marks Mi of i^th student respectively.

Output

A single integer denoting the maximum possible concentration


Constraints

1  ≤  N ≤ 10^5
 1 ≤  A[i] ≤ 10^3


Example
Input:
5
1 4
2 5
3 12
4 6
5 15
Output:
640
 

Explanation : 
For the given sample case above, students can be arranged in the following way based on their id - 1,4,2,3,5 to maximize the concentration. The concentration is calculated as follows - 4*1^2 + 6*2^2 + 5*3^2 +  12*4^2 + 15*5^2 = 640.
