It is well known that at Progteam you may enjoy coding with pizza :) However ordering pizzas is not that easy for the Progteam coach. This is because each student may eat a different number of pizza slices, and pizzas of different sizes have different number of slices. When ordering, the coach must ensure that there are enough number of pizza slices so that nobody stay hungry, and also there will be as few leftover slices as possible so that we don't waste food.
The coach has collected some information about the number of slices required:

There are SD students who do not like pizza, and each needs 0 slices.
There are SH students who are hungry, and each needs 1 slice. 
There are SV students who are very hungry, and each needs 2 slices.
There are SE students who are extremely hungry, and each needs 3 slices.


The nearby restaurant has three types of pizza available:

A small pizza with 4 slices. Each costs PS dollars.
A medium pizza with 6 slices. Each costs PM dollars.
A large pizza with 8 slices. Each costs PL dollars.


Your task is to help the coach find a best order of pizzas for given values of SD, SH, SV, SE, PS, PM, PL. The order shall minimize the number of pizza slices, while providing enough slices for all the students as required. If there are multiple such orders, you shall find the cheapest order. It there are still multiple possible orders, you may choose any of them.

Input
The input begins with the number of test cases T.
Each test case contains one line of 7 space separated integers for SD, SH, SV, SE, PS, PM, PL respectively.

Output
For each case, output three space separated integers for the best order: the number of small, medium and large pizzas respectively.

Constraints

T ≤ 100 
 SD, SH, SV, SE ≥ 0 
 0 ≤ SD + SH + SV + SE ≤ 100 
 1 ≤ PS, PM, PL ≤ 1000 


Example
Input:
2
3 14 8 1 15 22 27
1 14 5 0 16 24 32

Output:
1 1 3
0 0 3

Explanation
Example 1: We need 33 slices in total. It is not possible to order pizzas with exactly 33 slices. The smallest number larger than 33 we can do is 34.
Example 2: We need 24 slices. It is possible to order exactly 24 slices (3 large pizzas will do). Other orders are also possible at the same price.
