Every programming contest has a problem on factorials. Continuing with this tradition, we decided to include one too. 
Given two integers, n and p, find x (mod p) where x is the number obtained after eliminating all powers of p from n!.
Here n! denotes factorial of n.  Assume that p is prime.

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. This is followed by T lines each containing two space separated integers, n and p.

Output
One line for each test case, giving the value of the required expression.

Constraints

T ≤ 10
1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18
1 ≤ p ≤ 10^7


Example
Input:
1
5 3
