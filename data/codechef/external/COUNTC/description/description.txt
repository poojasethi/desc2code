A sea contains a number of continents. From a sea, we have randomly picked up an area of Dimensions  M * N.
Each continent is represend by  1 or group of 1's (joined either horizontally or vertically) in this area.
And  0's  represent the water that surrounds those continents. Each unit of this area can contain either 0 or 1
representing continent/part of continent or water surrounding the continent respectively.
For this given area of Dimension  M*N Find the Number of continents present in it.
Note: A group of 1's joined either horizontally or vertically is considered as a single continent.


Input
The first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Then T test cases are follow.
 The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers  M, N described in the statement.
Then it follows  M lines each of which contains N space seperated elements(either 0 or 1). 

Output
For each test case output a line consisting a single integer denoting the number of continents present in the given sea.

Constraints

1 <=T <=10^3
1 <=M,N <=300


Sub tasks

 Example case 1. 
The elements present at location ((0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(1,1),(2,1),(2,2) form a single continent.
The element at location (1,2) is another continent.
Hence, No Of Continents = 2.
Example case 2.
The element at location (0,0) is a continent.
The element at location (1,1) is a continent.
The rest of the 1's except at (0,0) and (1,1) form a single continent.
Hence, No of Continents = 3.
