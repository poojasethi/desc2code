CUO01 - EASY Sorting
 
Problem description.
Given an array containing a permutation of 1 to n, you have to find the minimum number of swaps to sort the array in ascending order. A swap means, you can exchange any two elements of the array.
For example, let n = 4, and the array be 4 2 3 1, then you can sort it in ascending order in just 1 swaps (by swapping 4 and 1). 
 

Input
Input description.
Input starts with an integer T (<= 100), denoting the number of test cases.
Each case contains two lines, the first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100). The next line contains n integers separated by spaces. You may assume that the array will always contain a permutation of 1 to n.


Output
Output description.
For each case, print the case number and the minimum number of swaps required to sort the array in ascending order. 
Example
