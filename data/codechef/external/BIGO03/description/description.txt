 
Chef Keshow and Chef Amit are taking discrete mathematics course. Today, they learnt
about recurrence relation. After the class, Chef Keshow challenged Chef Amit to solve a recurrence
relation. Chef Keshow gave Chef Amit a recurrence relation of the form
T(n) = a T(n-1) + b T(n-2) + c T(n-3) + d
where a,b,c and d are four constant positive integers and first three terms of the sequence are input
through stdin. (Check below to clarify any doubts).
Chef Keshow asked Chef Amit to find the nth term of the sequence.
 

Input
First line of the input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Each of the next T lines contain eight integers in the form :
a b c d T(1) T(2) T(3) n
All numbers are space separated.

Output
For each test case, output the value of the nth term of the sequence in a single line. Since this
value can be extremely large, print it modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7).

Constraints

1 <= T <= 50

1 <= a,b,c,d,T(1),T(2),T(3) <= 1000
 1 <=n<=1000000000 (10^9)

 

Example
Input:
2
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4

Output:
1
4
