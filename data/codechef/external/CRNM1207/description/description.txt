Silly is the chief of the secret department that works on Encryption techniques. YooTi works under Silly in that department. Silly is working on a new project. The project often requires the Exclusive-OR maximum to be found out on a set of integers with respect to another given integer called the query integer. So every time a query integer comes up to Silly, he asks YooTi to find out the Max (Ai xor B) where Ai is an integer from the set A and B is the query integer. YooTi is frustrated now because Silly gives too many query integers and she has to search out the whole set to find the answer. Can you help YooTi with this?


Input

First line contains N, the number of integers the set A.
Next line contains N space separated positive integers. The value of each integer will not exceed 1000000.
Next line contains Q, the number of query integers. Next Q lines contain the query integers B, one per line.



Output
Output  Q lines 'corresponding to each query containing a single integer, the max(B xor A1, B xor A2,.......,B xor An).

Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 100000
1 ≤ Q ≤ 10000
1 ≤ Ai ,B ≤ 1000000
