 
The Army Headquarters of the northern command had confidential message to be sent to the headquarters of the southern base. They devised an algorithm to encrypt the message. The message was encrypted using the following algorithm:
After every word, there is a number X associated with it, which is less than the length of the word.
First, the string before position X is reversed.  Then, the Z-transform (as explained below) is performed on every character of the remaining string.
Definition of Z-transform:
The Z-transform of character x is computed as follows. If the alphabet, x comes at position i in English Vocabulary, the Z-transform of x is (26-i+1)^th alphabet. For example, the Z-transform of A is Z, the Z-transform of B is Y, Z-transform of C is X, the Z-transform of Z is A, etc.
Your task is to encrypt a given word of the message. It is also given that all the characters in the string are upper case English alphabets.
 

Input
The first line of input contains T, the number of test cases. T lines follow, each consisting of a string space separated by the number X.

Output
For each test case output the encrypted text.
 

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
1 ≤ length of input string ≤ 100
0 ≤ X ≤ length of input string
