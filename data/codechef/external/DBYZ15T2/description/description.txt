 Problem Desciption
Shil likes to play with Palindromes very much.So he created his own version of Palindrome Game. In this game , he will be given
a string S and he needs to find out total number of pairs ( A , B )  such that A and B both are Palindromes present in  S  and B is a proper suffix of A.
Since string S contains a large number of Palindromes he asks for your help.Note that two Palindromes are considered different if they occurs at different position in string  S


Input
Only line of input contains string  S 

Output
Print a single integer denoting total number of pairs (A,B) . Since answer can be large print it modulus  10^9+7 

Constraints

 String S will contain atmost 10^5 lower case english alphabets ('a' to 'z').

 

Example
Input:
aabb

Output:
4

Explanation
All the possible palindromes are [ aa , a , a , bb , b ,b ].So all possible pairs are ( aa , a ) , ( aa , a ) , ( bb , b ) , ( bb , b )  
Note that two Palindromes are considered different if they occur at different positions in the string  S
