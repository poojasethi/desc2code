Alice and Bob are siblings who are very good at calculating things. Both of them have set world records and are known as 'the human calculators'. Bob is faster at calculating things but Alice is better at mathematics.
One day Bob challenged Alice to calculate f(n), where 
f(n) = 1^n × 2^n-1 × 3^n-2 × ... × (n-1)^2 × n
Alice knew that Bob's math is weak, so she said, "This is too easy for me. I will not just find f(n), I will also divide it by 10^9+7 and tell you the remainder". Bob thought Alice was being overconfident, but if you are good at math you would know that she was just being smart to avoid too much calculation!
Bob asked Alice to calculate f(n) modulo 10^9+7 for several values of n. Alice did so in a few seconds.
Now Bob has to check if Alice's answers are correct or not. He is too lazy to do the calculation himself. You have to help Bob by writing a program that finds f(n) modulo 10^9+7 for different values of n.
Input
The first line will contain a single integer T, the number of test cases. 
Each of the next N lines contain a single integer N, for which you have to compute f(N).
Output
Print f(n) modulo 10^9+7 for each N.
Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 1000 
1 ≤ N ≤ 10000000 
Sum of all N in an input file does not exceed 20000000

Explanation
1^1 = 1 
1^2 × 2^1 = 1 × 2 = 2 
1^3 × 2^2 × 3^1 = 1 × 4 × 3 = 12 
1^4 × 2^3 × 3^2 × 4^1 = 1 × 8 × 9 × 4 = 288
