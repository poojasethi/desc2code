Yalin has a little sister whom he loves very much. On her birthday, he decides to give her a special dictionary made up of words using just a few alphabets which appear in an odd order. Thinking she will love the gift as much as he did, he gifts it to her. But unfortunately, she doesn't like it at all. She wanted the book "The C Programming Language by Brian Kernighan & Dennis Ritchie". Angered by this, he throws away the dictionary and all the words fell off the book. His little sister starts crying and now demands to know which word appeared where.

Can you help Yalin calm his little sister down on her own birthday?
