This is the year 4242 and competitive programming has become a skill essential for survival. Our protoganist HarryPotter needs to access a MuggleBook today. MuggleBooks are made by DoubleUnicornTechnolgies and are very peculiar computers. They are identical to 21st century computers even in 43^th century. No wonder they are called MuggleBooks. To access this particular MuggleBook, HarryPotter needs to solve the following competitive programming problem (remember how it's an essential skill in 4242).

" Asya has a fully connected undirected graph G with N nodes. The nodes are numbered from 1 to N. Each edge has an positive integer weight. Every time she picks a subset S of V(G) (the nodes of G), and the edges that connect them, she finds the sum of edges of the subgraph of G thus formed. She calls it the funk value, F(S) of the subset S of nodes picked.

Calculate the sum  where the summation is over all subsets S of V(G).

Here  is the floor operation and  is the set cardinality operation. "

Help HarryPotter access the MuggleBook by solving the problem.


Input

The first line contains a single positive integer N, the number of nodes in graph G.
Then follow N lines, with N positive integers each. The j^th integer of i^th line is Wi,j, the weight of edge between i^th and j^th node.


Output
Print one integer, the answer to the problem.

Constraints

1 <= N <= 23
1 <= Wi,j <= 10^6
Wi,j = Wj,i
Wi,i = 0


Example
Input:
2
0 1 
1 0 

Output:
1
