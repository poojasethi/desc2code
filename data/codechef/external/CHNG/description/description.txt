I love planet CZ3E but I can't understand their strange currency Doople! Help me out with a program.

Given a currency system {a1, a2,....ak} (that is coins worth a1 Dooples, a2 Dooples....) and given a number N, find the number of ways to obtain N Dooples using the currency system. 
Note that we only want to know how many ways there are to make change, not what those ways are.

Input
The first line of input contains an integer K, the no. of coins in the system. The next K lines contain the values of the coins (one value per line). The last line will contain the value N. 

Output
Only one value, the number of possible combinations. 

Constraints
All values are positive. The coins are distinct. It may not be possible to have any combinations at all in some cases in which case the answer will be zero. 

1 ≤ K ≤ 10
1 ≤ ai ≤ 9999
ai= value of ith coin


Example
Input:
3
1
2
3
4
Output:
4

Explanation
Example: The possible combinations are:
1+1+1+1 ;
1+1+2 ;
2+2 ;
3+1
