The quarrels of Tom and Jerry are well known. On day they decide to sign a pact of friendship. Now you may be thinking what is the catch.
They can trick each other one last day. 
Tom gives Jerry N pieces of Cheese stacked in a line. The pieces are numbered 1 to N and placed in bowls also numbered 1 to N.
Tom adds a condition that Jerry has to eat the piece of cheese which is in bowl B. Jerry thought that it will be very easy to just go to the bowl and eat the cheese. 
But it is not that simple. First Jerry has to do a sequence of discards.
Each discard has the starting Bowl index (S) and an Ending bowl index (E) , Jerry has to throw away all the cheese that is in the bowls S through E (both inclusive). And then shift the adjacent pieces of cheese in the Empty bowls.
For Example:  If initial sequence is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
and Discard is 3-4 then final Sequence will be 1 2 5 6 7 8 9 - -

Lets say Bowl B is the 3rd bowl, so Jerry can only eat Cheese with number 5 which is now present in Bowl 3.
Note that bowls 8 and 9 are now empty, so Jerry was to eat from Bowl 8 or 9 he will have nothing to eat.
Help Jerry figure out which piece of cheese to eat.

 The sequence of the discards has to be maintained For Example if Jerry has to discard index 3 - 4 and then index 4 - 5 He  cannot  remove first 4 - 5 and then 3 - 4.
