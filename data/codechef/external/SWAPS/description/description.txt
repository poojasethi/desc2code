Problem description
Karthik has N bulbs in his house.But he has only one switch that works only once.

Initially the configuration of the bulbs are given to you as a string.1 if the bulb is already switched ON or 0 if the bulb is switched OFF.He is allowed to do exactly one move.He chooses two indices i and j and toggles the state of all the bulbs in the range [i,j] using the switch mentioned above.Changing the state means turning off a switched on bulb or turning on a switched off bulb.
Tell him the maximum number of switched on bulbs that are possible after one move.He must make one move.

Input
First line contains a number T denoting the number of test cases.Then T lines follow each containing a string of 1's and 0's.

Output
For each test case, output a single integer denoting the answer of the problem


Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100

1 ≤  length of string  ≤  10^5  



Example
Input:
210011001001
Output:
46

Explanation
In the first test case he chooses indices 2 and 3 and changes the states of 2nd bulb and 3rd bulb.Hence now he has 4 switched on bulbs, the maximum possible.
