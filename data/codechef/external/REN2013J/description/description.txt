You are given an array of length N.You are to perform certain operations on this array, these operations are of two types:


Update a range [x...y]: In which you must divide each number in the given range [x...y] by 2.This division is integer division i.e 7/2 = 3


Query a range [x...y]: In which you must output the sum of all the numbers presently in range [x...y].

Note:The range [x...y] mentioned above is inclusive of both index x and y.


Input
The input starts with a single line containing N (1<=N<=10^5) the number of elements in the array. The next line contains N space separated integers which are the elements of the array.The elements of the array will be between 0 and 1000.

The next line will contain Q (1<=Q<=10^5) the number of operations to be applied.Each of the next Q lines contains the specification of a query.Each of these lines contains 3 integers, the first being 1 or 2 denoting that the operation is an update or query respectively. The next two integers X and Y which represent the range on which to update or query [X...Y]. It is guaranteed that X<=Y and that X,Y<=N.

Output
The output should consist of exactly that many lines as the number of Operations of type 2.Where each line consists of the answer of the corresponding query.

Example
Input:

5
1 1 1 1 5
5
2 1 5
1 1 2
2 1 5
1 5 5
2 1 5

Output:
