On a straight road of length 10^5, n CCTV cameras are placed on different positions pi. The road starts at pi10^5. At time=0, the cameras are switched ON and are facing right. The range of view of each camera ri is also given i.e if camera is facing right, then pi to pi+ri (both inclusive) and if camera is facing left, then pi-ri to pi (both inclusive) is in the viewing range of that camera. And there is a time period ti associated with each camera i.e the i^th camera changes its direction from right to left or left to right at all multiples of ti.

Now, q queries are to be performed. A query contains two integers time and position. The answer to each query is the number of cameras watching that position at that time.


Input
Input description.

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer n denoting the number of cameras. The second line contains n space-separated distinct integers p1, p2, ..., pn in strictly increasing order denoting the position of each camera on the road.  The third line contains n space-separated integers t1, t2, ..., tn denoting the time period of each camera on the road.  The fourth line contains n space-separated integers r1, r2, ..., rn denoting the range of each camera on the road.


 The next line contains an integer q denoting the number of queries. Each of the next q lines contains 2 integers time and position for which answer is to be calculated.

Output
Output description.

For each test case, the output consists of q lines each containg a single integer count denoting the count of the camera for that query.

Test Case explanation:
Case 1
The direction of each camera changes as shown below-

For 1st camera at position 0:
R(0) L(1) R(2) L(3) and so on. 
For 2nd camera at position 5:
R(0) R(1) R(2) L(3) L(4) L(5) R(6) ...... 
For 3rd camera at position 10:
R(0) L(1) R(2) L(3) and so on. 

Here, R(i) means the camera is facing right at ith minute.
And L(i) means the camera is facing left at ith minute.
