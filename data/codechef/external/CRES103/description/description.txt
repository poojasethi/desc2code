Srinivas Ramanujan has got a typical problem in Mathematics . He has been given some integers and he needs to find triplets among them whose sum must be less than the integer specified by his class teacher. So, let us help him in solving that problem 
Problem description
 
You are given n  distinct  integers and from them you need to find the number of  triplets whose sum is less than S


Input

"The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases
 "The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the total number of integers 
 The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A0, A1, ..., AN-1 respectively
The third line of each test case contains the sum S which denotes the sum value for which triplets must be found whose sum is less than S


Output

"For each test case, output a single line containing a single integer J which is the total number of triplets whose sum is less than S".


Constraints

1≤ T ≤ 100
1≤N≤ 1000
-10000≤ A0,A1,....AN-1≤10000
1≤S≤30000
