Biswa is a genius. He likes to play with functions. He has defined a function f:



f(1, c) = c 
f(N, c) = Σ f(d, c) where 1 ≤ d < N and d divides N



He has asked his younger brother Debu to find the value of function for given N and c. You task is to help Debu solve this problem.


Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each of the next T lines contain two space separated integers N and c. 

Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the value of f(N, c) modulo 10^9 + 7

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^12
1 ≤ c ≤ 10^9

Example
Input:
4
1 1
2 3
10 1000000000
16 12345678

Output:
1
3
999999986
98765424
 

Explanation
In third test case 
 f(10, 10^9) = f(1, 10^9) + f(2, 10^9) + f(5, 10^9) = 3 * 10^9
