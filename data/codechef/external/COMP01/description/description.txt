 Neil is budding teenager who finds great fun solving mathematical problems and patterns. For one of his projects he's been working on, he decides to create a spiral containing N x N numbers in a particular pattern like this (where N is said to be the magic number):

2    3     5    7    11
53  59  61  67  13
47  89  97  71  17
43  83  79  73  19
41  37  31  29  23

Input
 line 1: the number number N(0 ≤ N ≤ 20)


Output
 an N x N matrix of the form as shown above


Example

Input:
5

Output:
2    3     5    7    11
53  59  61  67  13
47  89  97  71  17
43  83  79  73  19
41  37  31  29  23
