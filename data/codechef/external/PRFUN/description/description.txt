Problem Statement

	The primal of n, pri(n) is the product of the distinct prime factors of a given number. For example, 504 = 2^3 x 3^2 x 7, so pri(504) = 2 x 3 x 7 = 42. Let E(k) be the kth element in the sorted list of primals of all x where 1 <= x <= n. For example E(4) = 8 and E(6) = 9. Given the value of n and the value of k, you have to return E(k) from among the first n elements (starting with 1).


Input

First line contains the value of q, the number of queries.

	Each of the q lines contains a pair of integers n and k, separated by space.


Output

For each query, return the value of E(k).


Constraints

	1<=q<=1000

	1<=n<=100000


	1<=k<=n



Example
Input:
2
10 4
5 4

Output:
8
3


Explanation
first 10 values of pri(n) for 1 to 10 are:
     1
     2
     3
     2
     5
     6
     7
     2
     3
     10
Now for case1: n= 10, 4th element in sorted list will be 8 and
case 2: when first 5 values will be sorted 4th element will be 3
