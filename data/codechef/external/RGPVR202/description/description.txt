You had given group of integers and your job is to remove similar elements from it. In this process of removal of similar integers, integer that is found more than once is removed from its leftmost position. For example :
{1,2,3,4,2,2,3 } group of integer after this removal process became
{1, 4, 2, 3 }


Input
Input will begin with an integer T, the number of test cases. Each test case start with N the number of integer in the group followed by all the integer in the group in each line.

  1 ≤ T ≤ 50
  1 ≤ N ≤ 100
  -10000 ≤ value of element in group ≤ 10000


Output
For each test case, output group of integer that is specified in problem statement in single line
