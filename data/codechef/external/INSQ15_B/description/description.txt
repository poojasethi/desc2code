Lanku lives in a mysterious country having N cities. In his country instead of one capital, any number of cities can be capital. There are many cities in his country, but only the capital cities have all the facilities like hospitals, markets etc.
So in order to get anything you have to visit the capital city.
In order to simplify it, every city has been assigned to exactly one capital city. 
Apart from this, every capital city has an entry fee which means that whenever a person from another city enters its assigned capital city, he has to pay some entry fee.
 Consider one unit cost is used to travel one unit distance. 
 
You will be given the location of  N cities as N integers   x1 , x2
 , x3 .... , xN. 
You will also be provided with a positive integer K 

Now your objective is to choose  exactly K cities as capital and assign every city to exactly one capital city such that following function F is minimized: 
C[1] = cost to travel from 1^st city to its assigned capital city + fee to enter its assigned capital. 
C[2] = cost to travel from 2^nd city to its assigned capital city + fee to enter its assigned capital.  
..... 
..... 
C[N] = cost to travel from N^th city to its assigned capital city + fee to enter its assigned capital.  
F = C[1] + C[2] + .... C[N]  
NOTE: If the i^th city is capital city then C[i] = 0.

Output the minimum possible value of the function F. 
 

Input


First line of input will contain number of test cases T.


First line of each test case will contain 2 integers N and K


Second line of each test case will contain N integers which are the positions of cities in  1-Dimensional co-ordinate system.


Third line of each test case will contain N  integers which are the entry fee of the i^th city.


 

Output


Output will contain T lines, one for each test case.


Each line will contain one Integer which is the minimum possible value of the function F.


 

Constraints


1 ≤ T ≤ 10


1 ≤ N ≤ 200


1 ≤ K ≤ 35


K ≤ N


1 ≤ Entry fee, Position of cities ≤ 10^5


 

Example

Input

7 3
9 50 20 39 25 41 10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 

Output:
31
 

Explanation

In this scenario minimum possible value of F can be obtained by:
We will make city 1, 3, 4 as the capitals. 
Capital at city 1 will be assigned to city 1 and 7.
Capital at city 3 will be assigned to city 3 and 5.
Capital at city 4 will be assigned to city 2, 4 and 6.
C[1] = 0
C[2] = 11 + 4 = 15
C[3] = 0
C[4] = 0
C[5] = 5 + 3 = 8
C[6] = 2 + 4 = 6
C[7] = 1 + 1 = 2
