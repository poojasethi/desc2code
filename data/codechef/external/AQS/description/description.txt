You a given a tree consisting of N nodes, and a set of Q queries. Each query consists of a pair of nodes (u, v). For each query, find the number of nodes r, such that when you root the tree at r, either u is an ancestor of v, or v is an ancestor of u.

Input

The first line consists of two integers:N and Q.
The next N-1 lines consist of 2 integers each: u and v, each describing an edge.
The next Q lines consist of 2 integers each: u and v, each describing a query pair (u, v). 


Output
For each query, output the required answer on a separate line.


Constraints

N, Q <= 10^5
0 <= u, v < N
The given graph is a tree
For each query pair u, v; u != v
