Oh my God!!! Someone is trying to break into Thapar University's Database and steal sensitive research information. It is now up to us to stop this attack. Fortunately our defense mechanisms have traced the attacks to their source. The fastest way to stop the attacks is to disable the source. So all we need to do is to teach that guy a lesson, by planting a virus in his own system. But before we can do that, we need to break through all the layers of the security he has put around himself.
Our sources tell us that the first layer is based on ASCII encryption. We must penetrate through this layer as fast as we can to reach the source...
