You must have visited the old-fashioned green-grocers shop. The one who measures the vegetables in a balance, the vegetables being in one pan with some weights (each weight is known as "baat" eg. a "baat of 5 kg) in the other. Your task in this problem is very simple. Our green-grocer Chandra-vibhushan Pandey has a number of "baat"s and he needs to divide them into the two pans such that the difference between the weights in the two pans is minimum. Seems easy right? Well there is another catch. The difference in the number of "baat"s in the two pans should not be greater than one.


Input

The input begins with a single positive integer followed by a blank line which would indicate the total number of test cases following. The first line of each test case has an integer "n" which denotes the number of "baat"s in that test case. This is followed by the weights of "baat"s on each new-line. There is a blank line between two consecutive inputs. The number of test cases would be between (1 and 50) and weight of the "baat"s would not exceed 10,000.



Output

Your output for each input should consist of a single line printing total weight of one pan (less one first) and the total weight of another pan separated by a space. If there is a difference in the number of "baat"s in the two pans, print the weight of the pan that has less number of "baat"s. The output of each input should be on a new-line. You also have to check for erroneous cases. In case any error is detected, just print "error" for that input.
