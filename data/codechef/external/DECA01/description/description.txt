Problem Description
ISRO is working on its one of the most important projects. The project has many divisions.
Each Division has a certain number of people working as a group leaded by a team leader. Each member of the team is
identified by a unique ID depending on the ID of the Team Leader. The number of people working in a team
depends on the unique ID of the team leader. The Id of the leader consists of lowecase alphabets and digits only.
the IDs of the members are formed by shuffling the ID of the team leader such that the digits are not
shuffled, only the alphabets are shuffled. There are no duplicates in the ID. The task is to find
the number of employees working in a particular team. 
 

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then follow T lines,
each containing the ID of the leader of the team


Output
For each test case output the total number of people that can work in a team.
 

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ Length of ID ≤ 10

 

Example
Input:
3
abc123
a1b1
1a45k
Output:
6
2
2

Explanation
case 1 :6 possible IDs - abc123, acb123, bac123,bca123, cab123, cba123 (digits are not shuffled)
case 2: 2 possible IDs - a1b1, b1a1 
case 3: 2 possible IDs - 1a45k, 1k45a
