 
Amar has N empty candy jars, numbered from 1 to N, with infinite capacity. He performs M operations. Each operation is described by 3 integers, a, b, and k. Here, a and b are indices of the jars, and k is the number of candies to be added inside each jar whose index lies between a and b (both inclusive). Can you tell the average number of candies after M operations?
 

Input
The first line contains two integers, N and M, separated by a single space.
M lines follow; each of them contains three integers, a, b, and k, separated by spaces.

Output

A single line containing the average number of candies across N jars, rounded down to the nearest integer.
Note: Rounded down means finding the greatest integer which is less than or equal to the given number. E.g. 13.65 and 13.23 are rounded down to 13, while 12.98 is rounded down to 12.

Constraints

3≤N≤107
1≤M≤105
1≤a≤b≤N
0≤k≤106

 

Example
Input:

5 3
1 2 100
2 5 100
3 4 100

 
output:
160
 


Explanation

Initially each of the jars contains 0 candies
0 0 0 0 0  

First operation:
100 100 0 0 0  

Second operation:
100 200 100 100 100  

Third operation:
100 200 200 200 100  

Total = 800, Average = 800/5 = 160
