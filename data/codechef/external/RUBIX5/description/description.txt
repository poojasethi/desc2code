A lucky number N is defined as a number which has only two factors, both of them distinct and prime and the absolute difference between the two factors is not more than 50.

Given two integers, a and b, find the total lucky numbers in the range a to b (inclusive).

Input
1.The first input will be T, the number of test-cases. T ≤ 2000. T lines follow, one for each test case.   
2.For each test case there are two integers a and b on each line. 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 100000 

Output

For every test case, print the number of lucky numbers from a to b (inclusive).

Example

Input:
1
1 20
Output:
4
Explanation
From 1 to 20, there are four lucky numbers, 6,10, 14, and 15.
