A thief is trying to escape the holds of the police through a city. Let’s assume we represent our city by a weighted undirected connected graph(with no self-loops and multi-edges) with N nodes and M edges.
Thief is currently at vertex numbered S and needs to reach vertex numbered D. Thief moves with constant speed VT = 1.
K policemen are initially located in K distinct locations denoted by A1, A2, ... AK. Each policeman has a constant speed of VP = 1.

To help policemen, a single power booster have been provided to them. This power booster can be availed once from any one of the Q distinct ‘special’ nodes B1, B2, ... BQ. Property of this power booster being that it doubles the speed of the policeman who avails this power booster.

Note:
A policeman can choose not to avail the power booster even if he is at a ‘special’ node.

You have to print the shortest time in which thief can escape the police regardless of whatever path the police might take.
If he can’t reach the destination, output -1.


Input
First line contains N and M, the number of nodes and number of edges respectively.

Each of the next M lines contain integers u v and w denoting an undirected edge between nodes numbered u and v, w being the weight of the edge.
Next line contains a single integer K denoting number of different policemen. Next line contains K space separated integers denoting the distinct locations A1, A2, ... AK.

Next line contains a single integer Q denoting number of ‘special’ nodes. Next line contains Q distinct space separated integers denoting the locations B1, B2, ... BQ.

Next line contains two distinct integers S and D denoting the source and destination of the thief.


Output
For each test case print the minimum time required for thief to escape(if possible). Else, output -1.


Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
M ≤ min(2 * 10^5, N*(N-1)/2)
0 ≤ u, v, S, D, Ai, Bi< N
0 ≤ K, Q ≤ N
1 ≤ w ≤ 10^9

Output2:

Explanation
Example1:
Police takes the path 3 -> 0 -> 1 availing the power booster at node 0. Even though both policeman and thief reach the destination at same time, police catches thief.

Example2:
Whichever policeman uses the power booster, thief will be able to escape in 2 seconds.
