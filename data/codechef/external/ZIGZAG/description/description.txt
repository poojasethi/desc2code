Dorothy just realized that the yellow brick road isn't going to be an easy one. It's all zig-zag. Just to be safe, she decides to find out where she'll land at every step she takes. 
(1,1)  (1,2)  (1,3)  (1,4)  (1,5) ...
(2,1)  (2,2)  (2,3)  (2,4)...
(3,1)  (3,2)  (3,3)...
(4,1)  (4,2)...
(5,1)...
.
.
In the above diagram, the first step is at (1,1), the second step is at (1,2), the third at (2,1), the fourth at (3,1), the fifth at (2,2), sixth at (1,3), seventh at (1,4) and so on.




Input
A natural number (t <= 10000) which is the number of test cases.This should be followed by positive integers n in the next t lines. Each positive integer can be up to 10^10, it's a long road after all. 


Output
For each n, the nth step from the above diagram.



Example

Input:
3
4
7
14
Output:
