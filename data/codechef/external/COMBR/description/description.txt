Jack and Tony are two brothers. Tony loves playing with brackets and Jack loves combinations.One day their father gave them N bracket pairs and asked them to count the number of valid combinations of brackets that can be formed using exactly N bracket pairs.
All the bracket pairs are of same type say { }.
A combination with no brackets is valid.
If S is a valid combination of brackets then { S } is also a valid combination.
And if S and T are valid combinations, then S T is also a valid combination.

Input
There is only one line which contains an integer N denoting the number of pairs.

Output
Output the number of combinations that can be formed by N bracket pairs mod 1000000007. 

Constraints
0 ≤ N ≤ 20000

Example
Input:
3

Output:
5


Explanation

Possible combinations are { } { } { } , { } { { } } , { { } } { }  , { { { } } } , { { } { } } .
