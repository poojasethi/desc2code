Forces at Play

You are solving the physics paper of IIT-JEE and you are given a comprehension passage. Unfortunately, as most questions of these papers go, it contains a lot of forces given in a free body diagram. These forces are given as a vector (Fx, Fy, Fz) where Fx is force along x direction and so on. You have to find whether the body is in equilibrium or not.
Input:
The first line contains a positive integer T followed by T test cases. Each test case contains a positive integer n, denoting the number of forces followed by n lines containing three integers - Fx, Fy, Fz, the three components of the force. 
Output:
Output one line per test cases - "YES" if the body is in equilibrium and "NO" otherwise
Sample Input:
2
3
4 20 9
6 4 -1
1 -5 3
2
1 1 1
-1 -1 -1
Sample Output:
NO
YES
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 1000
1 <= n <= 1000
-100000 <= Fx, Fy, Fz <= 100000
