Welcome to Planet Numero!
In this land, numbers are people. All the factors of a number are its descendants. A and B are two such people who meet at a party. As they get to know each other they realise that they are in fact related!! 
In order to trace the common members of their family, they need your help. Identify the eldest descendent of both A and B and the youngest common ancestor they share.
.

Input
The first line contains an integer T, total number of test cases. Then follow T lines, each line contains an integer A and B. 

Output
Two integer values 

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
1 ≤ A,B ≤ 1000000


Example
Input:
3 
120 11
10213 312
10 3

Output:
1 1320
1 3186456
1 30


Code

This is the solution that P wrote for the problem:
#include <iostream>
int main() {
	int T,a,b;
	cin << T;
	for(int i=0;i ≤T;++i)
	{
		cin >>a;
		cin >>b;
		int r,c;
		c=a*b;
		
		while (a ≠ b)
		{
			if(a < b)
				{
				a-=b;
				}
			else
			{
				b-=a;
			}
			
		}
		cout <<a <<" " <<(c/a) << endl;
	}
	
	return 0;
}


Steps to be followed
    1. Read the given description carefully and understand the problem.
    2. Analyze the code given in the problem and find bugs(errors) in these codes..
    3. The given code can be copied and compiled in an online compiler (Eg. ideone.com).
    4. Once the bugs are eliminated from the code, the clean code can be submitted as the solution to the problem..
    5. The solution should be a debugged version of the code provided and must satisfy the test cases to be accepted..
All the best!!
