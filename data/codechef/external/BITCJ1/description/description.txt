You are given a sequence A of N non-negative integers in strictly increasing order.
The integers of the sequence are processed one by one from 1 to N(left to right). If you are processing the ith integer(Ai) in the sequence, you can either leave it as it is and move to the next integer OR apply exactly one of the following two operations:

Operation a: Replace Ai with any other non-negative integer greater than Ai, if 1<=i<=N-1.
Operation b: Replace Ai with any other non-negative integer less than Ai, if 1<=i<=N.


You also have to take care of the following conditions :

If you have applied Operation a to Ai, then there must be at least one integer in the remaining sequence(Aj where i+1<=j<=N), on which the Operation b is applied.
After the whole sequence is processed, the resulting sequence B(say) must be in a strictly increasing order.


Your task is to find how many such distinct sequences B(other than A)  can be formed from the given sequence A by processing the sequence in the manner described above.

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of integers in the sequence. The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the integers of the sequence in strictly increasing order. 


Output

For each test case, output a single line containing the number of distinct sequences B(other than A) that can be generated from the given sequence A


Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10000
1 ≤ N ≤ 50
0 ≤ Ai ≤ 50
