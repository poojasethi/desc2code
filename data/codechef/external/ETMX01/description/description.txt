FINDING PREFIXES
Homer: Marge, I just ﬁgured out a way to discover some of the talents we weren’t aware we had.
Marge: Yeah, what is it?
Homer: Take me for example. I want to ﬁnd out if I have a talent in politics, OK?
Marge: OK.
Homer: So I take some politician’s name, say Clinton, and try to ﬁnd the length of the longest preﬁx
in Clinton’s name that is a suﬃx in my name. That’s how close I am to being a politician like Clinton
Marge: Why on earth choose the longest preﬁx that is a suﬃx???
Homer: Well, our talents are deeply hidden within ourselves, Marge.
Marge: So how close are you?
Homer: 0!
Marge: I’m not surprised.
Homer: But you know, you must have some real math talent hidden deep in you.
Marge: How come?
Homer: Riemann and Marjorie gives 3!!!
Marge: Who the heck is Riemann?
Homer: Never mind.
Write a program that, when given strings s1 and s2, ﬁnds the longest preﬁx of s1 that is a suﬃx
of s2.

Input
Input consists of two lines. The ﬁrst line contains s1 and the second line contains s2. You may assume
all letters are in lowercase.

Output
Output consists of a single line that contains the longest string that is a preﬁx of s1 and a suﬃx of
s2, followed by the length of that preﬁx. If the longest such string is the empty string, then the output should be 0.

Example

Input:
clinton
homer

Output:
0


Input:
riemann
marjorie

Output:
rie 3
