Problem Statement
Chef is at a mountain range . There are N mountains lined up in a straight line . Each mountain has a height h[i] . Chef is currently at mountain a and wants to go to mountain b . He can do so by jumping from mountain a to b (he is talented ) . But he can jump from a to b only if there is no mountain between a and b whose height is strictly greater than that of mountain a .
In this problem , you will be given the array h containing heights of mountains and several queries with a and b , you will have you answer whether chef can jump from a to b or not .


Input
The first line contains an integer N, the next line has N integers denoting the heights of the mountains h[i] . The next line has an integer Q , the number of queries , Then q lines follow each containing 2 integers a and b.

Output
For each query , answer "YES" if chef can jump from a to b , otherwise answer "NO" if he cant .


Constraints

1 <= N <= 10^5
1 <= h[i] <= 10^4
1 <= Q <= 10^5
1 <= a <= N
1 <= b <= N
b>a


Example
Input:
5
2 3 1 2 4
3
1 3
2 5
2 3
Output:
NO
YES
YES


Explaination
For first query the answer is NO because between 1 and 3 , the second mountain is of height 3 which is more than height of mountain 1 which is 2 . For second query there is no mountain more than 3 units high between 2 and 5 so answer is YES. For 3rd query there is no mountain between 2 and 3 so the answer is YES .
