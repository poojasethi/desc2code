Sherlock is at a birthday party, where he sees 4 children fighting for chocolates which is kept before them. On enquiring, Sherlock
comes to know that the children are trying to split the chocolates amongst themselves. A child is satisfied if the number of chocolates
given is prime. Can you please help Sherlock split the chocolates among the children.
Initially there are N chocolates. You should split them into 4, so that the number of chocolates in each split is a prime.
Number of chocolates given to each child need not be equal.
There might be more than one solution for some inputs, print the one which has the maximum difference between the smallest and the largest value. And print the numbers sorted in non-decreasing order.
Newbies, please refer to 	 Codechef sample solution before starting to code, 

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.

The next T lines contains an integer N, which is the total number of chocolates.


Output:
Output T lines, each line containing chocolates split[Sorted in non-decreasing order] separated by spaces.
