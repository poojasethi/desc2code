A paper cube can be made up from six paper squares. 
            Given an projection (map) of the cube, you are to determine its correctness. A 
            projection is correct, if a cube can be made up from it.



  


Input: 


First line contains the number of test cases. Each 
            test case contains a projection represented as 6*6 grid containing 6 ones and 30 
            zeros, separated by spaces. 1s represent the paper squares. All squares are 
            placed immediately to each other, so that each square is connected with at least 
            one other square. Each test case is separated by an empty line. 


  


Output: 


For each test case, your program should print 
            “correct” if cube can be made up from the given projection, or “incorrect” 
            otherwise.
