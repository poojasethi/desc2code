We knows about base->2 (binary) integers and base->10 (decimal) integers, and various other positive bases. But what about negative bases. OK! lets talk about the "base-> -2". An integer n written in base -2 is a sequence of digits written right-to-left. Each of which is either 0 or 1 (no negative digits!), and the following equality must hold:
n = b0 + b1(-2) + b2(-2)2 + b3(-2)3 + ...
The cool thing is that every integer (including the negative ones) has a unique "base-> -2" representation, with no minus sign required. Your task is to find this representation.



Input
The Input consists of the number of test cases. Each one is a line containing a decimal integer n, in the range from -1,000,000,000 to 1,000,000,000, excluding 0. Terminate the input with n=0.



Output
For each test case, output one line containing base -2 representation of the input number.



Example

Input:
1
7
-2
0

Output:
1
11011
10
