There exist a 2-Dimensional rectangular field of  infinite length and breadth. 
N Iron Blocks are dropped onto this field from the sky at particular coordinates. However, it is made sure that only one block is dropped at a particular coordinate. 
You are standing at a particular location (X, Y) of the field. 
You have a magnet with a power M in your hand. A magnet of power M at coordinates (x1, y1) can attract an iron block at (x2, y2) to its own location if max(abs(x1 - x2), abs(y1 - y2)) ≤ M. (abs represents the absolute value function)  
Given queries containing your position (X,Y) and the value K. Your task is to find the minimum power of magnet you require to get at least K blocks to your own location. 
If it is not possible to get K blocks, output -1 for that case.
 

Input


First line of the input contains an integer N denoting number of blocks. Then follow N lines, i^th line contains two integers x and y denoting the x and y coordinate of i^th block


Next line contains an integer Q denoting number of queries.


Then follow Q lines, each line contains three integers X,Y and K, X and Y denoting your position and K denoting the number of blocks you need to bring to your position.


 

Output


Q lines containing answers to each of the queries in the input


 

Constraints


1 ≤ N ≤ 3000


1 ≤ Q  ≤ 100000


1 ≤ Any X or Y Co-ordinate  ≤ 10^9


0 ≤ K  ≤ 10^9

Explanation

Query 1: Using a magnet of power 1, block at (2, 2) can be brought to (2, 3).

Query 2: Using a magnet of power 0, block at (2, 2) can be brought to (2, 2).

Query 3: Using a magnet of power 1, blocks at (2, 2) and (3, 1) can be brought to (3, 2).
