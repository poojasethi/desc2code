Given an array A having n elements, let X be the maximum sum of any contiguous sequence in the array. How many contiguous sequences in A sum up to X ?


Input :
The first line contains T the number of test cases. There follow 2T lines, 2 for each test case. The first line contains the n, the number of elements in the array. The second line contains n space seperated integers Ai.


Output :
Output T lines, one for each test case. On each line, output two space seperated integers; the maximum sequence sum, and the number of sequences which obtain this maximum sum.


Sample Input :
2
3
-1 -1 -1
4
2 0 -2 2


Sample Output :
-1 3
2 4


Constraints :
1 ≤ T ≤ 35
1 ≤ n ≤ 100000
-1000 ≤ Ai ≤ 1000
