Please help him calculate this efficiently.
Input - 
The first line has a number T, indicating the number of test cases.
Next T lines contain a number 'n' each.
Output - 
T lines printing “YES” or “NO” if it can be written as a sum of two prime numbers or not(w/o “”)
Constraints - 
1<= T <= 10^6
0<= n <= 10^6

Example
Input:
1
