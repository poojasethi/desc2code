 
You are inside an NxM maze which you have to exit. Also, let us name this maze “IIIT D” and
the exit “graduation”.
You have to calculate, given a maze, the minimum number of steps you need to take from the
starting point to reach the exit. If the exit is unreachable from the starting point, print ­1
 

Input
First line contains 2 integers : N and M.
Each of the next N lines contain M characters, “.” denoting blank space, “#” denoting wall, “S”
denoting your starting position and “E” denoting exit. You are at S and have to move to E
through a sequence of moves. Legal moves are defined below.
If you are at some cell, you can move to any of the 4 adjacent cells that are not walls. e.g.
.##
S..
#..
In the above (incomplete) maze, you can only move upwards and rightwards as the cell
directly below you is occupied by a wall.


Sample Input:
4 5
#....
..#.#
E#...
#S.#.

Output
On a single line, output the number of minimum steps to reach exit, or “­-1” if this is not
possible.


Sample Output:
10

Constraints
1<=N<=10^3
1<=M<=10^3 

Explanation
One can reach from S to E by the moves : right, up, right, up, up, left, left, down, left, down
