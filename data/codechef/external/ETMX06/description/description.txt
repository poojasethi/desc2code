Common Integer

Andy wants to prove his practical programming knowledge to his old pal.

He will get two numbers both in the range 10 to 99.

if there exists a comon integer in both the numbers, he has to write TRUE or else FALSE.

For Example: if input numbers are 12 and 24, the output must be TRUE since the common integer is 2 in both numbers.

Help Andy by developing a code that does his job.

Input
First line is two numbers separated by a space. The numbers must be in between 10 and 99.

Output
Next line is the output TRUE or FALSE depending on the input.

Example

Input:
12 24

Output:
TRUE


Input:
11 34

Output:
FALSE
