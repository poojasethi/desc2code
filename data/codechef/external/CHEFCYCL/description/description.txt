Chef once wanted to count the number of vertex disjoint cycle covers of a directed graph. A cycle cover is a set of cycles covering the set of vertices (A set of cycles S is said to be covering set of vertices if each vertex lies in at least one of the cycles in S). A vertex disjoint cycle cover is a cycle cover in which no two cycles have any common vertex. A cycle is a sequence of t > 1 distinct vertices a1, a2, ..., at such that there is an edge from ai to ai+1 for 1 <= i < t and an edge from at to a1.

Chef has a directed graph G containing n vertices and m edges. You have to help the chef in finding out the number of vertex disjoint cycle covers in it. As the answer could be very large, please print it modulo 10^9 + 7.


Input

First line of the input contains a single integer T denoting number of test cases. 
Description of T test cases follows.
First line of each test case will contain two integers: n, m denoting number of vertices and number of edges in the graph G.
For next m lines, each line will contain two space separated integers: u, v denoting that there is an edge from u to v in the graph.


Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting the answer to the problem. 


Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 5
1 ≤ n ≤ 20
0 ≤ m ≤ n × (n - 1)
1 ≤ u, v ≤ n
u != v
It is guaranteed that no edge repeats in the input. So all ordered (u, v) pairs (represending edges in the graph) appearing in the input will be distinct.

Explanation
Example case 1. There is exactly one vertex disjoint cycle cover. ie. (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1)
Example case 2. There is exactly one vertex disjoint cycle cover in this graph too. Collection of cycles in that cycle cover will be (1 -> 2 -> 1) and (3 -> 4 -> 3)
Example case 3. There is no vertex disjoint cycle cover in this case, as (1 -> 2) is not a cycle.
