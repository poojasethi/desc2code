Ankur has two boxes containing infinite number of coins of Re 1 and Rs 2 respectively. He is
interested to purchase an item that cost Rs X. So, he took some coins from the first box and
some coins from the 2nd finally he is able to obtain the total amount as Rs X from the coins.
i.e. Suppose number of Re 1 coins =p and number of RS. 2 coins = q.
Then X= p+ 2q;
Find out the total number of ways possible for the man to achieve the total amount as Rs X from the coins.
Note: The order in which he choose the coins also matters i.e. 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 and 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 are considered as different ways.


Input
1) First line contains T - number of Test Cases
2) Each of the followinf T lines contains 1 integer X .

Input:
1
5


Output:
8


Explanation
Example case 1. 
Here sum is: 5
Possible ways:
1) (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1)
2) (1 + 1 + 1 + 2)
3) (1 + 1 + 2 + 1)
4) (1 + 2 + 1 + 1)
5) (2 + 1 + 1 + 1)
6) (2 + 2 + 1)
7) (2 + 1 + 2)
8) (1 + 2 + 2)
Hence ans = 8.
