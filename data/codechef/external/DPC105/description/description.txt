Given a M by N grid of letters, (1<=M,N<=50), and a 
            list of words, find the location in the grid at which the word can be found. A 
            word matches a straight, uninterrupted line of letters in the grid. A word can 
            match the letters in the grid in the grid regardless of case (i.e. upper and 
            lower case letters are to be treated as the same). The matching can be done in 
            any of the eight directions either horizontally, vertically or diagonally 
            through the grid. 


  


Input 


The input will contain one or more test cases. The 
            first line of each test case begins with a pair of integers, M followed by N, 
            1<=M,N<=50 on a single line. The next M lines contain N letters each; this is 
            the grid of letters in which the words of the list must be found. The letters in 
            the grid may be in upper or lower case. Following the grid of letters, another 
            integer K appears on a line by itself (1<=K<=20). The next K lines of input 
            contain the list of words to search for, one word per line. These words may 
            contain upper and lower case letters only (no spaces, hyphens or other 
            non-alphabetic characters).The input will end with two zeroes for M and N. 


  



Output 


              
            For each word in the word list, output a pair of integers representing the 
            location of the corresponding word in the grid must be output. The integers must 
            be separated by a single space. The first integer is the line in the grid where 
            the first letter of the given word can be found (1 represents the topmost line 
            in the grid, and m represents the bottommost line). The second integer is the 
            column in the grid where the first letter of the given word can be found (1 
            represents the leftmost column in the grid, and n represents the rightmost 
            column in the grid). If a word can be found more than once in the grid, then the 
            location which is the output should correspond to the uppermost occurrence of 
            the word (i.e. the occurrence which places the first letter of the word closest 
            to the top of the grid). If two or more words are uppermost, the output should 
            correspond to the leftmost of these occurrences. All words can be found at least 
            once in the grid. Separate the output of each test case with a blank line.
