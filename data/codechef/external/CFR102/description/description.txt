Ram is an astrologer who calculates the lucky number of people using their date of birth. He uses the special formula to calculate their lucky number. The formula is dd*mm+yyyy if date of birth is in the format dd-mm-yyyy. Then he recursively adds all the digits of answer unless and until single digit is obtained.

For example: 31-12-1995 is the date of birth of a person then his lucky number would be calculated as follow:
31*12+1995= 2367 => 2+3+6+7=18 => 1+8=9
So 9 is the lucky number.
