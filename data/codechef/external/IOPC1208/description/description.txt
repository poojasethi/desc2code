Given natural numbers N and Q, an N-vector is defined as the ordered N-tuplet of integers (x0, x1, x2 ..... xN-1) such that 0 ≤ xi < Q for all i. The parent of coordinate xi is defined as x(i-1) mod N and the child of xi is defined as x(i+1)mod N.
The IOPC transformation converts and N-vector x into an N-vector y with the coordinates given by :

 If parent(xi) ≤ child(xi) then yi = (parent(xi) + child(xi))/2 
 If parent(xi) > child(xi) then yi = (parent(xi) + child(xi) + Q)/2 mod Q

Note that the division above is integer division - fractions are always rounded down.
As an example, let N=4, Q=5. Let the N-vector x be (2,0,3,1). Then the transformed N-vector y is (3,2,0,5).
An N-vector x is said to be invariant under the IOPC transformation if the yii for all values of i. Given N and Q, find the number of invariant N-vectors.

Input
The first line of the input contains T, the number of test cases (T ≤ 10000). Following this are T lines, each consisting of two space separated integers N and Q (1 ≤ N,Q ≤ 10^9).

Output
For each test case, output the number of invariant N-vectors. Since the answer could be very large, output it modulo 100000007.
