Problem Statement
Sam is good at sequences and likes to find the minimum elements in sequences. One day, Sam got bored of finding the minimum elements of sequences. He then decided to find all the minimum elements of all contiguous sub-sequences, of a sequence. Since, Sam has a poor memory, he won’t be able to remember all minimum elements, so he decided to find the sum of all such minimum elements. Can you help him in this task.

For a given sequence A(A1,A2……AN), your task is to find the sum S of the minimum elements of all the possible contiguous sub-sequences of A.


Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N(the number of elements in the sequence). The next line contains N space separated integers(the elements of the sequence).

Output
For each test case, output a single line containing S the required answer to the problem.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
-5x10^8 ≤ Ai ≤ 5x10^8

Example
Input:
2
3
1 2 3
2
10 11

Output:
10
31

Explanation for first test case:
Possible contiguous sub sequences {(1),(2),(3),(1,2),(1,2,3),(2,3)}
Sum of minimum elements = 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10
