Papa Smurf is trying his hands on a new type of dish named IngrediMix. The process of preparation of this dish requires N ingredients (namely a0, a1, a2,... aN-1) to be mixed together in one bowl. Every ingredients has a nutritional value (v0, v1, ..., vN-1) associated with it.
The process of creation of dish continues until we have all ingredients mixed in one single bowl. In each step, we follow any one of the following steps
a) Select one of the unselected ingredient, ar, and put it in a new bowl. The nutritional value of this bowl will be vr.
b) Select one of the unselected ingredient, ar, and put it in a bowl already containing ingredient ar-1 (or ar+1). If the ingredient ar and ar-1 (or ar+1) has additive binding, then the nutritional value of the bowl is increased by vr. If they have multiplicative binding, then the nutritional value of the bowl is increased by the factor of vr.
c) Select any two bowls A and B, such that if Bowl A has ingredient ar, then Bowl B must have ingredient ar-1 (or ar+1). Merge Bowl B into Bowl A. If the ingredient ar and ar-1 (or ar+1) has additive binding, then the nutritional value of the bowl A is increased by the nutritional value of bowl B. If they have multiplicative binding relation, then the nutritional value of the bowl A is increased by the factor of nutritional value of bowl B.
Papa Smurf wants to mix the ingredients in such a manner such that the final dish has maximum nutritional value. Help him.

Input
The first line of input contains a single number, T, number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains an integer N, total number of ingredients. Then in second line, we have N space separated integers (v0, v1,..., vN-1) representing the nutritional value of ingredients. In third line we have a string S containing N-1 characters, representing the binding relation between ingredients. If S[i] = 'a' then, there is an additive binding relation between ingredient ai and ai+1. If S[i] = 'm', then we have a multiplicative binding relation between ingredients ai and ai+1.

Output
For each test case, find the maximum nutritional value Papa Smurf can get for his dish. As this number can be very large, print the answer modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7).

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 10
2 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^5

Example

amam

Output:
105


Explanation
The following procedure describes the mixing process to be adopted by the Papa Smurf.
1. Ingredient a0 (v0 = 1) is taken in bowl A. Ingredient a1 (v1 = 2) is added to it to yield a mixture having nutritional value 3 since the binding is additive in nature.
2. Ingredient a2 (v2 = 3) is taken in bowl B. Ingredient a3 (v3 = 4) is added to it to yield a mixture having nutritional value 7 since the binding is additive in nature.
3. Now ingredient a4 (v4 = 5) is added to bowl B and the nutritional value of this bowl changes to 35 as a3 and a4 has multiplicative binding relation.
4. Now the mixture in bowl B is added to the mixture in bowl A to get a final mixture, having nutritional value of 105. As bowl B has ingredient a2 and bowl A has ingredient a1, and they have a multiplicative biding, the nutritional values of both bowls are multiplied.
5. Dish preparation process stops as bowl A has all ingredient and it can be easily verified that this is the highest nutritional value possible with the given order of ingredients.
