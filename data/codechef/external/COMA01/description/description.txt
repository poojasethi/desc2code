Chef has been spending some time learning  and became fond of it.Chef's tutor gave him a problem.
Chef has an array A of N elements and a set of Q queries. Each query is of type L R, where 1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ N. For each query Chef has to calculate two space separated integers Gmax and Gmin Where,
Gmax = max{gcd(Ai,Ai+1,Ai+2,....Aj) | L ≤ i ≤ j ≤ R }
Gmin = min{gcd(Ai,Ai+1,Ai+2,....Aj) | L ≤ i ≤ j ≤ R }
Chef got confused with these much queries, can you help him solving the problem.

Input
The first line contains two space separated integers N Q.
The second line contains N space separated integers A1 A2 .... AN.
The next Q lines contain the query of type L R.

Output
For each query, output the required value of Gmax Gmin in a separate line.

Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 100000
1 ≤ Q ≤ 100000
1 ≤ Ai ≤ 1000000000

Example
Input:
4 4
2 3 10 7
1 4
2 2
1 3
3 4

Output:
10 1
3 3
10 1
10 1


Explanation:
In the last query L=3 R=4
Subarrays are {10},{7} and {10,7}
Their GCDs are 10 , 7, 1.
Gmax=max(10,7,1)
Gmin=min(10,7,1)
So, answer is 10 1
