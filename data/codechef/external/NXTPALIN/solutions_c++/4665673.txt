   Map of the program below:

   Bscically,i have to find the next palindrome after a given number k.

   So,concept is really a simple one and thus a specimen for me to experiment new features.

   I have used enumeration(declared globally here) and class named palindrome(in C++).

   We know that the members of a class are private by default if not declared.

   The above statement means private (and protected too) members can not be accessed by objects of the class.

   I have delared a function nxtpalin in public mode so that it can be accessed inside main().

   Note: In C++,if we declare an enum inside structure or class,then its scope is inside that class/structure only and not global.

   But,in C ,the scope of enum is global even when declared inside a class/struture.

   Also,enum can also be declared globally as global types.
