A positive integer is called a palindrome if its representation in the decimal system is the same when read from left to right and from right to left. For a given positive integer K of value not more than 100000 , write the value of the smallest palindrome larger than K to output. Numbers are always displayed without leading zeros.


Input

There is a single positive integer T on the first line of input. It stands for the number of numbers to follow. Then there are T lines, each containing exactly one positive integer number N, 1 ≤ N ≤ 10000


Output

For every input number N, output a single line containing the  smallest integer value which is a palindrome and greater than N.


Example

Input:
3
14604
3902
153
Output:
14641
3993
161
