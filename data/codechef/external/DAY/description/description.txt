Problem description.

up with a new method for the registration process. For this, an
arena has been built in the form of an N x M matrix. A student starts
the registration process at the cell in the top left corner, and the
process completes at the cell in the bottom right corner. All other
cells have an intermediate registration stage which take up some
time t. A student can advance from the current cell to either the cell
to the right, or to the cell to the bottom of the matrix. You want to
minimise the time required for the registration process, since you
prefer to have it completed before lunch time.


Input
The first line will be an integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case will have two integers N and M,
denoting the number of rows and columns of the matrix shaped
arena. In the N lines that follow, for each line i from 1 to N, there will
be M space separated integers tij (for j from 1 to M) denoting the
time required at each cell of the matrix.

Output
For each test case, print the minimum time required to complete the
registration process on a single line by itself.


Constraints

1 <= T <= 10
1 <= N,M <= 10^3
1 <= tij <= 10^3



Example
Input:
1
2 2
0 5
7 0
