There is a series which represents the levels of triangle.
1 3 6 10 15 21 28...... and so on. 
Suppose there is triangle of level 1 and it can be formed by 1 star("*"), Triangle of level 2 is formed by 3 stars, similarly the Triangle of level 5 can be formed by using 15 stars.
Your job to find the least number from the series which can have n(input) factors excluding the number itself.
For Example: 5 is the input then 28 is the answer because 28 has 5 factors i.e. 1,2,4,7,14



Input
Input is a single line containing the numnber of test cases T not more than 10. First line of each test cases contains a positive integer.



Output
For each test case ,output a single line containing the number.



Example

Input:
2
5
8

Output:
28
36
