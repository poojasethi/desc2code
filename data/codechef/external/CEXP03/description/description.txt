 Wonderland is a big land. WonderKing wanted to divide it in to provinces and rule them because that is easy. But he has a problem with naming the provinces. He wants to name them with mirrored palindromes only.
 A regular palindrome is a string of numbers or letters that is the same forward as backward. For example, the string "ABCDEDCBA" is a palindrome because it is the same when the string is read from left to right as when the string is read from right to left.
 A mirrored string is a string for which when each of the elements of the string is changed to its reverse (if it has a reverse) and the string is read backwards the result is the same as the original string. For example, the string "3AIAE" is a mirrored string because "A" and "I" are their own reverses, and "3" and "E" are each others' reverses. 
 A mirrored palindrome is a string that meets the criteria of a regular palindrome and the criteria of a mirrored string. The string "ATOYOTA" is a mirrored palindrome because if the string is read backwards, the string is the same as the original and because if each of the characters is replaced by its reverse and the result is read backwards, the result is the same as the original string. Of course, "A", "T", "O", and "Y" are all their own reverses.
 A list of all valid characters and their reverses is as follows.

 The WonderKing wants you to help him to find palindromes, mirrored strings, mirrored palindromes separately. 

Input

First line of input contains the number of strings you should check
Each following line contains a string which you should check with your program.
Each line will consist of one to fifty valid characters.  
 There will be no invalid characters in any of the strings. 


Output
 For each input string, you should print that string and immediately follow it by exactly one of the following strings.


String
Criteria


"is not a palindrome."
if the string is not a palindrome and is not a mirrored string


"is a regular palindrome."
if the string is a palindrome and is not a mirrored string


"is a mirrored string."
if the string is not a palindrome and is a mirrored string


"is a mirrored palindrome."
if the string is a palindrome and is a mirrored string



Example
Input:
4
NOTAPALINDROME 
ISAPALINILAPASI 
2A3MEAS 
ATOYOTA

Output:
NOTAPALINDROME is not a palindrome.
ISAPALINILAPASI is a regular palindrome.
2A3MEAS is a mirrored string.
ATOYOTA is a mirrored palindrome.
