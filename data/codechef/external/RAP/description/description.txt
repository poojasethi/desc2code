Problem Description:
Rahul requests Abhishek to help him in his project. As Abhishek is busy right now in his android project, so in order to keep Rahul busy for some time   he agrees to help him on a condition. He tells him that he will definitely help him if Rahul can solve a very easy question.
The question is to find all the even coefficient in the binomial expansion of (1+x)^N for a given value of N.
For example suppose the value of n is 3.Then the expansion of (1+x)^3  is (1 + 3x + 3x^2 + x^3) and the coefficients are 1,3,3,1. So the number of even coefficients is 0.
