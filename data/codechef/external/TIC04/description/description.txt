Guru Z wants has taken part in a problem solving competition and is looking to you for help. He has been given the ‘N-Queens Problem’ to solve in the Finals.

The N-Queens Problem states that for a given N x N chessboard, find a way to place N queens such that any queen cannot kill any other queen on the board. A queen can be killed when it lies in the same row, or same column, or the same diagonal of any of the other queens.
