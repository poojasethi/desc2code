		Mrs. Beakley was teaching her grand-daughter Webby some math. Today, Mrs. Beakley taught how to evaluate (possibly very large) expressions involving numbers and binary operators. Mrs. Beakley also gave Webby some homework. But Huey, Dewey and Louie wants Webby to join them for a game of Baseball. Help Webby complete her homework.
		Webby, being a brilliant duck, can handle expressions of any size. But Webby understood nothing in today's class, thanks to the teaching abilities of Mrs. Beakley. As of now, Webby can solve any expression, if it is well-formed. A well-formed expression is an expression in which, each binary operator, together with its operands (possibly other expressions) are enclosed in a pair of parenthesis. The number of pairs of parenthesis must match exactly the number of binary operators (not one more, not one less).
		Your task is to transform a given expression into a well-formed expression.
	

Input

		The only line of the input consists of a valid mathematical expression. This expression consists of at least one binary operator (+, *, -, /, ^) and the corresponding operands (each one being a single digit), and possibly a few properly matched pairs of parentheses. There are no white-spaces.
	

Output

		Output on a single line, the corresponding well-formed expression. There should be no white-spaces anywhere in the output expression.

		The default operator precedence is as follows: ^ has highest precedence. Then comes / and *, which have the same precedence. + and - have the same (least) precedence. Whenever there are two operators of the same precedence, the one that appears first in the expression (from left) will be evaluated first.
	

Constraints

		The expression given in the input will contain a maximum of 64 characters.
	

Example

Sample # 1
Input:
1+2

Output:
(1+2)


Sample # 2
Input:
3-2-1

Output:
((3-2)-1)


Sample # 3
Input:
3-(2-1)

Output:
(3-(2-1))


Sample # 4
Input:
1+2*(3-4)/5+1/2

Output:
((1+((2*(3-4))/5))+(1/2))


Sample # 5
Input:
1+2*(3-4)/5^1/2

Output:
(1+(((2*(3-4))/(5^1))/2))
