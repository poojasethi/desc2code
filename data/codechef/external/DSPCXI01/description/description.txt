The IP Address Class defines the number of networks and IP addresses that are available to an organization for use. An IP Address is comprised of 32 bits (4 octets) 

of information. The IP address is working with two pieces of information: the network ID and the host ID. Based on the number of network and hosts the IP Addresses 

have been divided into different classes – A, B, C, D & E.
 Currently the NetTech team is conducting its certification course at BIT Mesra. Ayush Kedia  is a first year student and has little knowledge of networking. However the test is coming up and he needs your 

help to top the list. He has a list of IPs which has to be classified based on the IP Addresses. Your job is to write a program that will print the class of the given 

IP Address.
