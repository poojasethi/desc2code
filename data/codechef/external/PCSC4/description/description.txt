 
Joel and Neha have been working to balance the CS Club's finances.  They have a stack of tickets, each containing the date and amount of money spent, and they need to process them.  However, they each prefer to process them in a different order.  Joel wishes to process them in order of the greatest expense to the smallest expense, while Neha wishes to process them starting with the oldest expense and ending with the most recent.  Create a program that will take in a list of dates and expenses and then print out both ways of ordering the tickets..
