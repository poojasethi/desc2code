You are given n points in 2 D plane. Let us represent the n points by p[1],p[2],....p[n]. No two points have same coordinates and no three points are colinear. 
Consider the set of lines L = {L : L is a line segment made by connecting (p[i],p[j]) for all 1 ≤ i,j ≤ n and i!=j} 
Two line segments L1 and L2 are said to be related if they intersect at a point which is not an end point of either of segments.
A set of lines L is said to be a ”super” set if it does not contain any two line segments which are related.
Now you wonder what could be the maximum possible size of a "super set" which belongs to L

Input Format

The first line contains an integer T, representing the number of test cases.



For each test case, first line will contain a single integer N. Then the next N lines, will contain two space separated integer x[i] and y[i].



Output Format

The output consists of T lines, each line corresponding to a test case. For each test case, output the maximum possible size of a "super set".



Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
-10^9 ≤ x[i],y[i] ≤ 10^9
Sum of N over all test cases would be ≤ 2*(10^5)
