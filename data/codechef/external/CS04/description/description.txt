Problem text...
Mr. G. works as a tourist guide. His current assignment is to take
some tourists from one city to another. Some two-way roads connect the cities. For
each pair of neighboring cities there is a bus service that runs only between those
two cities and uses the road that directly connects them. Each bus service has a limit
on the maximum number of passengers it can carry. Mr. G. has a map showing the
cities and the roads connecting them. He also has the information regarding each
bus service. He understands that it may not always be possible for him to take all
the tourists to the destination city in a single trip.
But Mr. G. finds it difficult to find the best route himself so that he may be
able to take all the tourists to the destination city in minimum number of trips. So,
he seeks your help.
