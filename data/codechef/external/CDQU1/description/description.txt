Charlie has a fascination for Prime Numbers. But he never went to school so he always makes a mistake when he is asked to tell whether a number is a Prime Number or not. So, he asks his brother Alan to help him out with this. Your job is to help Alan in writing a program which prints THE SUM of all prime numbers between  M and N  (inclusive).

Input
The first Line of Input will contain an Integer  T , Denoting the number of Test Cases.
The next T Lines, each, will have 2 space separated Integers M and N 


Output
For Each Test Case, Output a single Line containing the SUM of all Prime Numbers between M and N (inclusive).It would be advisable to use Long Datatype for storing the sum.

Constraints

Example
Input:
2 1 837 45                                                                                                                                                                                              
Output:
17 121                                                                                                                                                                                      

Explanation
In the first case, Prime Numbers between 1 and 8 are 2, 3, 5 and 7. Their sum is 17.
In the second case, Prime Numbers between 37 and 45 are 37, 41 and 43. Their sum is 121.
Note: The Input and Output Format must be strictly followed.  Each output MUST be on a new LINE. JAVA users must be careful while using BufferedReader for Input Format as Two Integers cannot be Inputted on the same line while using BufferedReader. Any mistake in the input format might make a correct solution give a Wrong Answer while submitting.
