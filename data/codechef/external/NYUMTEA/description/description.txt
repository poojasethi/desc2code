Bohan loves milk tea so much and he drinks one cup of milk tea every day. The local shop sells milk tea in two sizes: a Medium cup for $3 and a Large cup for $4. For every cup of milk tea purchased Bohan receives a promotional stamp. Bohan may redeem 6 stamps for a free drink of milk tea regardless of the size. No stamp will be given for a free drink.
