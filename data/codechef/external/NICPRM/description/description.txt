We call a permutation {p[1], p[2], ..., p[n]} of {1, 2, ..., n} nice if and only for all 1< i  ≤ n , there exists a  j < i  such that |p[i]-p[j]|=1.
You have a permutation of {1, 2, ..., n}, which might or might not be nice. You have to find the smallest nice permutation which is not less than the given permutation. A permutation {p_1, p_2, ..., p_n} is said to be less than {q_1, q_2, ..., q_n} if p_i < q_i for the least i such that p_i ≠ q_i . 

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer: n.
The second line contains  n distinct space-separated integers each between 1 and n, denoting the permutation given to you.  


Output

Output a single line containing n distinct integers: the least permutation which is not less than the given permutation. 


Constraints

1 ≤ n  ≤ 100000


Example
Input:
3
1 2 3

Output:
1 2 3

Input
3
3 1 2

Output:
3 2 1


Explanation
Example case 1. The given permutation is good itself, so the answer in this case will be the given permutation. 
 Example case 2. This permutation is not good because there does not exist any j<2 such that |p[j]-p[2]|=1. The next good permutation is 3 2 1.
