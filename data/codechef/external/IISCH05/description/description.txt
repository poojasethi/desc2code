You will be given a string of lowercase English alphabet letters. You have to find two palindrome which 
are non-overlapping subsequences such that the product of their lengths is maximised.

(Subsequence: It is a string derived from deleting some elements without altering order.
AC is a subsequence of ABCD; BA is not.)

Let's say P and Q be two subsequences. Pi and Pj are the indices of first and last characters of P,
in basic string (Similar definition for Qi and Qj).They are non-overlapping if Pj < Qi. In other words,
the first character in subsequence Q should come only after complete appearance of subsequence P.

Basic string can have almost 3200 characters.

I/p format:
Input contain one string only(Sequence of non-separated characters).

output
The product value for each String.

Sample Input:
aaapaaskmywbcaajjaacb

Sample Output:
50

Reason:
P:- aaaaa (5)
Q:- bcaajjaacb (10)
5*10 = 50
