Ancient Indian Mathematicians like Bhaskaracharya, knew the Pythagoras Theorem even before Pythagoras was born! Though they called it with a different name. They identified the theorem and used them widely as a set of 3 numbers a, b,c such that a*a + b*b = c*c. We'll call this set as 'TriMurthy'. 
TriMurthy contains 3 numbers which can be integer, decimal , positive, or even negetive). Any TriMurthy of the form a,b,c represent a right angled triangle which Base = a; Height = b; Hypotenuse = C. We find that cosA = a/c. Hence any TriMurthy represents an angle A.
A 'TriMuthy' is called a 'Vishesh TriMurthy' if its elements are whole numbers and have no common factor. For example 3,4,5 and 24,7,25 are Vishesh TriMurhty, however, 6,8,10 is not a Vishesh TriMurthy (though is is TriMurthy)  because 2 is a common Factor.

Your task is to determine whether a TriMurthy is a Vishesh TriMurthy or Not.

Problem Setter: 

Input
The input contains 3 integers a,b,c in each new line. The number of test cases is not specified. Input Ends with End of File.

Output
You have to print YES if a given TriMurthy is a Vishesh TriMurthy otherwise print NO for each set of a,b,c in new line.
