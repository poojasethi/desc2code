There is an infinite integer grid at which N people have their houses on. They decide to unite at a common meeting place, which is someone's house.  From any given cell, all 8 adjacent cells are reachable in 1 unit of time.  eg: (x,y) can be reached from (x-1,y+1) in a single unit of time. Find a common meeting place which minimizes the sum of the travel times of all the persons.  Input Format: N The following N lines will contain two integers saying the x & y coordinate of the i-th person.  Output Format: M M = min sum of all travel times;   Constraints: N <= 10^5 The absolute value of each co-ordinate in the input will be atmost 10^9
 HINT: Please use long long 64-bit integers;
