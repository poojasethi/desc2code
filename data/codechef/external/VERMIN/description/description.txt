 
You are given an undirected graph G of n nodes, numbered from 1 to n having m edges. G does not contain self-loops or duplicate edges. G might not be connected.
We define the score of any such graph G as the number of pairs of vertices (u, v) such that there exists exactly 1 path from u to v.
Note that a path is a sequence of vertices u1, u2, ..., uk such that: 


k ≥ 2,

	There exists an edge between ui and u(i+1) for all 1 ≤ i ≤ k - 1, 

ui equals uj if and only if i equals j and 

u1 < uk.


Let the score of G be K. G is valid only if K < M. Let G' be a connected, undirected graph without duplicate edges or self-loops and with score equal to K + 1.
What is the minimum number of vertices in G' if G is valid?
.
 

Input
The first line contains 3 space separated integers - n, m and M. 
The next m lines contain 2 space separated integers each, u and v, meaning that G has an edge (u, v).
 

Output
If G is not valid, simply output -1. 
Otherwise, output the minimum number of vertices G' should have so as to have a score of exactly K + 1. Also, G' should be connected and must not contain self-loops or duplicate edges.
