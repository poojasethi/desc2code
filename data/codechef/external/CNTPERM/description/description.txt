 Problem Statement 

Chef recently studied about binary searched trees . He also read about balanced Binary Search Trees .  
In this problem , a Binary Tree with 'N' elements is called balanced if its height is ceil(log(N + 1)) where ceil(x) function denotes the smallest integer â‰¥ x and log(N + 1) is in base 2.  
A permutation of integers [1 , N] is a sequence where each element from 1 to N occurs exactly once in any order  
Chef wonders , How many permutations of integers [1 , N] exist for a given N such that when inserted into a binary search tree from leftmost element to the rightmost element , will yield a balanced binary search tree.  
For simplicity , the integer 'N' here will be of the form 2 ^ x  - 1  or 2 ^ x  - 2 .

Print the answer modulo a prime number given in input 

 Note 

If you know the algorithm to insert a number into a binary search tree , you may skip this part  


function insert(node root , int number):
    if root is empty:
        root.value = number
    else if root.value > number:
        insert(root.left , number)
    else:
        insert(root.right , number)


The height of a tree is defined as maximum distance of a node from the root + 1


 Input format 
The first and the only line of input containts 2 integers 'N' and 'mod'  

 Constraints 
 1  <=  N  <=  2 ^ 20  - 1  
 N  <  mod  <=  10 ^ 9  + 9  
 N  is of the form  2 ^ x  - 1  or 2 ^ x  - 2  
 mod  is a prime number  

 Output 
Print a single integer denoting the number of permutations which yield a balanced binary search tree when inserted into a binary search tree from left to right modulo mod.

 Explaination of some samples 
For N = 3 
The permutation which yield a balanced binary search tree are  
[2 , 1 , 3] and [2 , 3 , 1]  
Both yield the following tree  


     2
    /  \
  1   3


For N = 2  
Both the permutations [1 , 2] and [2 , 1] yeild a binary search tree of height 2 which is balanced hence answer is 2.
