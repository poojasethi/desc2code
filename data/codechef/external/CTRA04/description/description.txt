 
A town in Death Valley has a water tank that contains 100,000 litres of water. Water is consumed by the town at the rate of X litres per week. If it is assumed that there is no rain, your job is to find the total number of weeks water will last.
Do not include the last week if the water remaining for that week is less than the weekly usage amount. 
 

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
Each test case contains a single number X denoting the usage of water by town in litres/week. 
 

Output
For each test case, output a single line with format - "X litres will last for Y weeks", where X is water usage and Y is the number of weeks water will last.
 

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ X ≤ 10^5
 

Example
Input:
3
3960
1024
8425

Output:
3960 litres will last for 25 weeks
1024 litres will last for 97 weeks
8425 litres will last for 11 weeks

 

Explanation
In the example test there are T = 3 test cases.
Test case 1.
In the first test case, X = 3960. At the rate of 3960 Litres/week, after 25 weeks only 1000 litres of water will be left, which is not sufficient for a week. Hence, no more week, the water can last and the remaining 1000 litres are ignored. Finally Y = 25.
Test case 2.
In the second test case, X = 1024. At the rate of 1024 Litres/week, after 97 weeks only 672 litres of water will be left, which is not sufficient for a week. Hence, no more week, the water can last and the remaining 672 litres are ignored. Finally Y = 97.
Test case 3.
In the third test case, X = 8425. At the rate of 8425 Litres/week, after 11 weeks only 7325 litres of water will be left, which is not sufficient for a week. Hence, no more week, the water can last and the remaining 7325 litres are ignored. Finally Y = 11.
