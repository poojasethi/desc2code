 
Eshaan and Nischay decided to play a game. Nischay asked Eshaan to choose 2 distinct digits A and B. Eshaan calls a positive integer “lucky”, if it contains only the digits A and B. Nischay calls this number “superlucky” if sum of its digits is “lucky”.
For Example : If Eshaan chooses A = 1 and B = 3, then number 12 isn’t lucky but 133 or 1133131 are lucky. Also number 1133131 is superlucky but 133 is not.
Now Eshaan wants Nischay to find how many superlucky numbers of length exactly N are there.
Help Nischay to find the answer to this problem.
Since the answer can be very large, print answer modulo (10^9+7).
 

Input

The first line of input contains T, denoting the number of test cases.
The second line of input contains 3 integers A,B and N.

 

Output

Print a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo (10^9 +7).

 

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 50
1 ≤ A < B ≤ 9
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6

 

Example
Input:
2
1 3 3
2 3 10

Output:
1
165
 

Explanation
Example case 1. Only one number of length 3 is superlucky which is 111 because 111 is lucky and sum of its digits 1+1+1=3 is also lucky.
