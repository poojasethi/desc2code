On her B'day, Ira got a Tree containing N nodes as a gift from her best friend. All the nodes of the tree, number from 1 to N, contains light bulb, which can glow either white or black. Initially all the bulbs are glowing white.  All the nodes also contain some integer value, say i^th one contains vali. These initial values will be given in the input. In order to add more joy to the occasion, she started asking her friend some questions. In total she asked him Q questions one by one. 

A question can be one of the following three types - 

 M u v m f 
 This means that you need to do the following with the nodes that come in the path from node u to node v. 
Multiply the value stored in the nodes by m .  If f = 1, then  flip the colour of the bulbs, otherwise do not change the colour of the bulbs.

 A  u v a d f 
 This means that you need to add an Arithmetic progression whose first term is a  and common difference is  d. a is added in node u. Meaning of f  is same as described earlier.

Q u v
 Meaning you need to find out the following things about the path from u to v. Call the sum of all the elements in the path from u to v be  sum . Following cases may occur. In each case print the answer as described.


 If all the nodes are of same colour from u to v then, what is the colour.  Call it col.

 Print :    "sum Uniform col"     (without quotes) respectively in a line. 



If they are not same, then find the first node in the path from u to v where colour change happened. Call this node x and it's colour  col.

 Print :    "sum Non-uniform x col"     (without quotes) respectively in a line.


Value of col can either be "white" or "black". Since the value of sum can be huge or negative, you just need to find it modulo 10^9+7. Modulo for negative integers is also defined. It is defined as - minimum non negative integer that need to be subtracted from it so that it becomes divisible by 10^9+7. Nothing special about the definition, its just for information.
 



Input

First line contains two integers N and Q respectively. N-1 lines follows, each containing two integers u and v denoting there is an edge between them.
The next line contains N space-separated integers. i^th integer denotes the initial value, vali at  node numbered i. 
 In the next Q lines, each contains a query of one of the type as described above.


Output

For each query of third type, output a single line containing the answer to that query.


Constraints

1 ≤ u, v, x  ≤  N 
-10^9 ≤ a, d, m, vali  ≤  10^9
0 ≤  f  ≤  1
