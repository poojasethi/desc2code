 
A quiz show rates participants according to their level intelligence. Two 
different quiz shows were organized, one for boys and the other for girls.
Now the results of both quiz shows are out. The participants of both the shows 
have decided to date each other, but as usual they have difficulty in choosing 
their partners. The Maximum Match dating service (MMDS) comes to their rescue 
and matches them in such a way that that maximizes the intelligence bonds for 
all couples.
If a boy has been rated at intelligence level x and a girl at intelligence 
level y, the value of their intelligence bond is x*y.
Both shows contain N participants each. MMDS has done its job and your job is 
to find the sum of intelligence bonds for all the couples that MMDS has 
proposed.

 

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer t, the number of test cases. 
t test cases follow.

Each test case consists of 3 lines:


The first line contains a single integer N (1 <= N <= 1000).


The second line contains N integers separated by single spaces denoting the intelligence levels of the boys.


The third line contains N integers separated by single spaces denoting the intelligence levels of the girls

.
All intelligence ratings are on a scale of 0 to 10.


Output
For each test case output a single line containing a single integer denoting 
the sum of the intelligence bonds for all pairs that MMDS has proposed.

Constraints

N ( 1 ≤ N<=1000)

All intelligence ratings are on a scale of 0 to 10.
