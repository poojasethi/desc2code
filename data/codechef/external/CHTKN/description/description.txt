Chef and Tikna are good friends and both of them like to solve problems. They both are going to participate in ACM ICPC this year. Tikna is very good at mathematical problems but not with strings based problems.
Chef was given this problem by him .In the problem a string is given which consist of distinct lower case alpahabets.
 The task is to calculate all possible strings which can be formed from the given string by swapping 1 or more neighbouring character pairs. 
Now Chef got strucked in this problem and he needs your help to solve the problem.

Note : Only neighbouring character pairs can be swapped.

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consist of two lines ,on 1st line the length of the string N is given and on the 2nd line the string is given .

Output
For each test case, output two lines, on 1st line output number of unique strings which can be made.
On the second line output the lexicographically smallest among those strings.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤2000
1 ≤ N ≤ 26


Example
Input:
2
4
remi
1
z

Output:
5
erim
1
z

Explanation
Example case 1.The various strings which satisfy the problem statement are

remi,ermi,erim,reim,rmei. out of which erim is lexicographically smallest. 
Example case 2. The only string which can be formed is z
