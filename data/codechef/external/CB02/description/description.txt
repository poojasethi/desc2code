 You are given N poles of length 1, 2, 3, ... , N. You need to tell us the number of triangles that can be formed using any three of the given poles. 

Constraints: 3 ≤ N ≤ 100,000

Input
 The first line of the input contains the number of test cases T, at most 10000. Each of the next T lines contains a positive number N.

Output
For each value of N in the input, output on a new line the number of triangles that can be formed using the given poles.
