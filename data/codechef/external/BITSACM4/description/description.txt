Problem description.
 Mike and Rachel are in love with each other. They want to chat over the internet but, Rachel’s father who is unsupportive of their relationship has kept a tab on her internet access. So Mike developed a secret chat software over which they need to share a common password in order to chat. So they used an interesting method to exchange a numeric password.

Rachel and Mike agree to use a prime number p and base g.
Rachel chooses a secret integer a, then sends Mike A = g^a mod p
Mike chooses a secret integer b, then sends Rachel B = g^b mod p
Rachel computes s = B^a mod p
Mike computes s = A^b mod p
Rachel and Mike now share a secret (the number s).


Input
The first line contains T, the number of test cases and then description of each test case follows. The first line of each test case contains two integer p and g. Next line contains the secret integers a and b.

Output
Output a single line for each test case indicating the secret number s.
