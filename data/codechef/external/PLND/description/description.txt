A palindrome is a word that has the property of reading the same in either direction.
Your task is to find out all palindromes in a given string 's', where the length of all palindromes is equal to k.

Input
First line of input contains t, the number of test cases.
Each test case contains two lines of input. The first line of input is the length of the required palindromes k. The second line contains the string 's'.
The length of the string would be less than 20.
0<=t<=20

Output
The output for each test case should be the number of different palindromes of length k, that can be formed from the above string. We say two palindromes are different when they start from different positions. Remember, the palindromes need not be unique i.e two similar palindromes are valid if they are different.

Example

Input:
2
3
abababa
4
rockkcor

Output:
5
1
