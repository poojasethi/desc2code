Chef Amit is obsessed with strings. He likes palindromic strings even more. So his friend chef Keshow gave him a string for his birthday. Chef Keshow then challenged chef Amit to find the number of sub-strings in the given string which are also palindromes. Since it is his birthday and he wants to open other presents, chef Amit is asking you to solve the problem for him. 

Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer 'T' denoting the number of test cases. Each test case contains a single string 'S' only. Each string contains only lowercase English alphabets.'n'.

Output
For each test case, print on a single line the number of substrings of the given strings which are also palindromes.

Constraints

1 <= T <= 1000

1 <= |S| <= 1000 (|S| is the length of the string)



Example
Input:

2
a 
aba

Output:

1
4
Explanation :

Case #1 :
a is the only substring.
Case #2 :
