You have an unbiased coin which you want to keep tossing until you get N consecutive heads. You've tossed the coin M times and surprisingly, all tosses resulted in heads. What is the expected number of additional tosses needed until you get N consecutive heads?


Input

The first line contains the number of cases T. Each of the next T lines contains two numbers N and M.


Output

Output T lines containing the answer for the corresponding test case. Print the answer rounded to exactly 2 decimal places.
