 

Sherlock and Moriarity are again back in game. This time Moriarity transformed himself as an impersonator and made his own K number of clones, each of them hidden at K different locations in the City. Sherlock observed that City, having N number of locations, has the structure of a tree with N number of nodes and each node represents a distinct location in the city. Now Sherlock is interested in finding the total number of subtrees which contain all the K locations where Moriarity's clones are hidden. Help him find the answer. Since the answer can be very large, print the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.

Note : In this problem, the tree is unrooted, so a subtree simply means a connected subset of nodes.

Input

The first line of input contains the number of test cases T. T test cases follow:
For each test case, first line contains N, the total number of locations.
Next N-1 lines contains two numbers u and v, signifying there is a path between u and v.
Next line contains K, followed by distinct K number of locations where Moriarity's clones are hidden. 


Output

For each test case, output in a single line the total number of subtrees which contain all the K locations where Moriarity's clones are hidden.

 

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
0 ≤ K ≤ N
