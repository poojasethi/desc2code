 
WBUT has a unique grading style:


Grade    Marks
O  ------  91-100
E  ------ 81-90
A  ------  71-80
B  ------  61-70
C  ------   51-60
D  ------  41-50
F  ------   0-40


Now in a class there are n students and the state of a class can be defined by the grades of its students. Like {G1, G2, G3, ……… Gn} where Gi can have values from the set {O,E,A,B,C,D,F} and 1<=i<=n . And then we write its as a string - > G1G2G3……Gn

Given the number of students in a class, give the number of possible state-strings of that class.

Input

First line of input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases. The next t lines contain an integer n denoting the number of students in a class.

 

Output

For each test case, print the answer in mod (10^ 9 +7).

 

Constraints

 1<=t<=10 ^ 5  
 1<=n<=10^ 6 ^
