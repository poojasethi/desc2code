We the students belonging to IIST, have found an electronic device for space applications. In order to standardize, for measuring the component value
we decided to opt the resistance color coding algorithm. The electronic component contains four bands of colors. Now the electronic department needs 
your help for measuring the component value if the four color bands are given.Since it was invented by a student GUNTUR, the component value follows 
the unit name 'Guntur' with a space between them.
NOTE: Excluding tolerance color bands like gold and silver

Input
Input contains
four strings of colors of resistance color coding with spaces between them.

Output
Your output must contain the electronic component value and unit name with a space between them.

Example

Input:
white black blue red

Output:
3696200 Guntur

Explanation
input:white(9) black(0) blue(6) red(2)
output:(36962)101001 0000 0110 0010)b * 10^2, because last band is red.
