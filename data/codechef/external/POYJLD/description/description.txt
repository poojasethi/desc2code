Jayant has a likliness for colorful ladders. He decides to get a new ladder which has differently coloured steps such that one or more steps have same colours.
Jayant gives each step of the ladder an indiex 1,2,3.. and so on.
Jayant became curious about the colours and wants to know the numbers of ladder steps which have the same colour. Jayant wants to make the task difficult and wants to know the number of steps with a certain colour within the range i to j (inclusive),where i and j are indices of the steps within the ladder with 1 indexing.
Jayant represents the ladder using a string of characters where each character represents the color of the step of the ladder at that index.
Your task is to print the number of steps of the color Jayant wants within the given range.
The number of colors is 26 ie.(a to z colors). 

Input

The first line contains the character string.
The next line contains Q the number of queries.
Each of the next Q lines contains two integers i and j and character denoting required colour, in space separated manner. 

 

Output

For each query print the number of steps of given colour within the specified range.


Constraints

1 ≤ L(length of character string) ≤ 100000.
1 ≤ Q no of queries ≤ 10000.
1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ L.


Example
Input:
abcdabbc
5
1 5 a
2 8 b
3 8 b
1 5 a
4 7 c

Output:
2
3
2
2
0


Explanation
In the first query we have to count the number of steps having colour 
corresponding to character a withing the range 1 to 5 which is clearly 2.
The rest can be calculated accordingly.
