But he is really disappointed with the behavior of the contestants as they are not very willing to do class or learn new things .  So he decided to set a  problem on new topic in Intra AUST Programming contest that they will learn this topic through reading the problem statement . We asked him about the problem and fortunately he shared his problem with us . 
 
 Euler circuit is a path that starts from any node ,  uses every edge of a graph exactly once and then finishes at same starting node .  In this Problem there is given a graph with ‘V’ vertexes and ‘E’ edges .  Your task is to find there exists a euler circuit  or not . If so then print “Yes” otherwise print “No” . 
 

Algorithm to detect Euler Circuit  :  

Graph should be connected 
Degree of every vertex should be even . Degree of a vertex means total incoming and outgoing edge of a vertex .  


Input
Input starts with an integer T ( 1 <= 30 ) , number of test cases . Each test case consists of two integer n ( 1 <= n <= 500 ) and m ( 1 <= m <= 10000 ) where n is the number of nodes and m is number of edges between these nodes . Following m lines contain two integer u and v . There is a bi-directional edge between u and v . 

Output
For each test case first print the case number and then print “Yes” if there exist an Euler circuit otherwise print “No” . 

Constraints

1 <= T <=  30
1 <=  n  <=  500 
1 <=  m  <=  10000 


Example
Input:
2
4 4
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 1
4 4
1 2
2 3

Output: 

Case 1: Yes
Case 2: No
