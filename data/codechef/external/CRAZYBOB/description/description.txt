Crazy Bob came across a set of n transformers that are all faulty. Crazy bob decided to fix it in a crazy way. The n transformers are of 2 types. The first  kind can be fixed in a single attempt with probability A% and the second kind can be fixed in a single attempt with probability B%. You are given a string composed of characters 'A' and 'B' to denote which type of transformers each one is.

As always, Bob wants to show off his transformer fixing skills in a crazy way. While atleast one of the transformer is mal-functioning, he randomly chooses a set of k transformers and attempts to fix all of them. The transformers that are already working (in the set of chosen k) remain working. Of the chosen transformers that are still mal-functioning, the transformers that are of type A get fixed with probability A% and the transformers of type B get fixed with probability B%.  You are asked to find the expected number of steps Bob takes to fix all the transformers. One step is a selection of k random transformers from n.


Input

The first line of the input consists of the number of testcases T (T ≤ 200).
Each of the test case starts with 4 integers n, k, A, B which denote the number of transformers to be repaired, the number k crazy-bob chooses at each iteration. A and B are the probabilities in percent. 
Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 40, 
1 ≤ k ≤ n, 
1 ≤ A ≤ 99, 
1 ≤ B ≤ 99, 


Output

Output one number for each line - the expected number of iterations crazy-bob needs to perform before all the transformers are repaired. Your answer will be considered correct if the absolute difference between your number and the correct number is

Explanation:

In the third test case, Bob randomly chooses one of the 
transformers (with 1/2 probability each) and fixes them. 
Thus he is left with fixing 1 transformer. Let x be the 
expected number of moves before he can fix the 1 
transformer.
So the answer is 1+x.
To calculate x, at the next step, he  randomly chooses any
 of the transformers (with 1/2 each). If he chooses the fixed
 transformer, he has wasted the move and is back to x. If 
he chooses the faulty one, he has fixed both the 
transformers. Hence x = 1+1/2(x) or x = 2.
The required answer is 1+x = 3.
