We wish to tile a grid of size Nx2 with rectangles (dominoes) of 2x1 (in either orientation).
Write a program that takes input N and outputs the number of different ways to tile the grid. Output the ans mod 10^9 + 7

Input
First line contains T (number of test case)
Next T lines contains N(height of grid) 

Output
T lines with desired ans mod 1000000007 in each line

Constraints
1 <= T <= 1000 1 <= N <= 10^12

Example
Input:
2
1
2
Output:
1
2
