 
Given three integers, a b c, return true if it is possible to add two of the ints to get the
third.
(1, 2, 3) → true (3, 1, 2) → true (3, 2, 2) → false

Input
the first line is the number of testcases. the second line is the eqality bit either 0 or 1 the third line
is the set of three numbers.

Output
print true if they are increasing order with or without equal number in it based on equality bit.

Example
Sample Input:

1 2 3

Sample Output:

true

Sample Input:

3 2 1

Sample Output:
