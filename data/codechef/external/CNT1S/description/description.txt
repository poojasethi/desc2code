Compute the number of ones in an unsigned integer,ofcourse there is a conventional way of doing this by accepting
the input as an integer or string and then conting the one's using conditional statements but there is a crazy
way of doing this.BE CRAZY TO CRACK THIS DOWN.

Input
An unsigned integer x

Output
For each input,output a single line consisting of an integer which is the number of one's in the binary value of x

Example
Input 1:
10

Output 1:
2

Input 2:
14

Output 2:
3
Â 

Explanation
