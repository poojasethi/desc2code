The Primorial of a number N is defined as the product of all the primes <= N. You are asked to calculate the Primorial for a given value of N.
Note : Primorial For N

Input
The first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case contains a single line consisting a single integer denoting the value of N 

Output
For each test case output a line consisting a single integer denoting the primorial of the given number

Constraints

1 <=T <=100
1 <=N <=100
