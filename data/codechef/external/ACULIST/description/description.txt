Problem Description
Sherya and Priya were feeling bored.So they decided to play a game of numbers.Shreya started the game.She gave priya N lists

L11 L12 L13....L1x
L21 L22 L23....L1y
.
.
.
LN1 LN2 LN3....LNz 
Then she asked her to make a new list containing those numbers which are at the positions 0N,1N,2N,3N,4N,... away from the respective list numbers

Help Priya in making the final list of numbers!

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the number of lists 
For each list first its length Mi is entered,followed by the line containing Mi numbers.


Output

For each test case, output a single line containing the resultant list b.

 

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10000
1 ≤ N ≤ 10000

 

Example
Input:
1
3
5
1 2 3 4 5
8
2 3 5 6 8 9 10 11
2
3 4

Output:
1 4 3 8 11


Explanation
Example case 1.
First element of 1st list   1
From first position,Nth(3rd) element is 4 (4th element).     1->4

Second element of 2nd list  3
From second position, Nth(3rd) element is 8 (5th element).    1->4->3->8
From second position, 2Nth(6th) element is 11 (8th element).    1->4->3->8->11

There is no 3rd element in 3rd list so that is the end of output
