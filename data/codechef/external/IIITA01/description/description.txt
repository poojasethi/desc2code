 A number is called a special number if it doesn't contain 3 consecutive zeroes. You have to calculate the number of positive integers of exactly d digits that are special. Print your answer modulo 1000000007.

Input
 First line contains integer T, the number of test cases. Next t lines contain an integer, value of d for that test case.


 Constraints 
 0 < T ≤ 100, 0 < d ≤ 10000 

Output
 A single line for each test case, with the count of such numbers.

Example

Input:
3
4

31

Output:
8991
900
334647494
