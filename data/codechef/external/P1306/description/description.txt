 Rohit is very fond of mathematics. He wishes to create a sequence of numbers. The nth number in the series f (n) denotes the number of occurrences of the number n in the series. The series has first 2 elements as 1 and 2.
The sequence goes as follows:
_N_ : 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12...  
f(N) : 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5,  6 ... 
Your aim is to provide the value of the function f (n) most efficiently.

Input
The first line of input consists of a single integer t denoting number of test cases. Each of the next t lines will have an integer value n.

Output
The output should consist of t lines, each line giving the value of function f (n) for the corresponding n.

Example

Input:

3
10
20
100


Output:

5
8
21
