		As part of his new invention, the gold cloning machine, Gyro Gearloose has to calculate nCr for large values of n (take a guess, why!!). But he has not added this part to the machine, as he has not yet been able to compute them efficiently. Now, Scrooge McDuck wants this machine completed by tomorrow. As Gyro is busy working on the aesthetics of the machine, he wants you to write and test the code for him.

		(nCr is the number of different ways of choosing r items from a group of n items.)
	

Input

		First line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases.

		Then T lines follow, one per test case.

		Each line contains two integers n and r.
	

Output

		For each test case, output a single line containing the value of nCr. Since the result can be too big, output the result modulo the prime number 1000000009 (10^9 + 9).
	

Constraints

		1 ≤ T ≤ 100

		0 ≤ n ≤ 200,000

		0 ≤ r ≤ n


Example
Input:
3
10 5
100 50
0 0

Output:
252
933591892
1

Explanation

Test Case 1: The value of 10C5 is 252.

Test Case 2: The value of 100C50 is 100891344545564193334812497256. The result is larger than 1000000009. So, when reduced modulo 1000000009, it becomes 933591892.

Test Case 3: The value of 0C0 is 1.
