You are moving from cities to cities in search of a treasure. There are N cities numbered from 0 to N-1.
Initially you are at city no. 0 and Treasure you are looking for is at city number N-1.
Each city is connected to two cities directly except for city number 0 and city number N-1 wich are connected to only one city directly.
0-->1-->2-->3-->4........-->N-1
As the journey from a city to another city is tiring you can pass at maximum d-1 cities without stopping.
For eg. if you are at city 0 and d is 3 then you can move from 0 to 3 without stopping at city 1 or city 2.
If you stop at any city you have to pay a certain amount of money M[i] to that city which varies from city to city.
Given money required to pay for stopping at each cityy our task is to reach city number N-1 from city number 0 by spending minimum amount of money possible.
Remember You can only start from city 0 if you pay the amount that should be paid to city 0. As you have to reach city N-1, you have to stop there, so you will have to pay the respected amount.

 

Input :

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
On the first line of every test case is given two space separated integers N and d.The next n lines that follow have positive integers <= 1000, representing the money to be paid at each city. These lines are listed, in order, from start to end city.



Output :

For each test case, output a single line containing.
