 
PROBLEM STATEMENT 
Today Liya got a mathematics problem from her teacher , she wants to solve the question but she is unable to solve and so asks for your help. Can you help her !!
The question is  given  n and k evaluate “ The sum of all binomial coefficients with n as superscript and i as subscript (  nCi  )  with i ranging from 0 (zero)  to minimum of (k,n-k)  . This sum divided by  2 raised to power n-1 ( 2^(n-1) ) ” .
For details see the explanation section for clarification .
 

INPUT
First line of input is the number of test cases t .  For each test case ,next line contains 2 integers n and k . 

OUTPUT
Only one line per test case, the ans to the question multiplied by 100 ( rounded off  to exactly one decimal place  ).

Constraints
1<=t<=10, 0<=k<=n<=1000000 , n>0 .

TEST CASES
INPUT:
1
20 5
OUTPUT:
4.1

EXPLANATION
Here n=20 and k=5 ,  so answer will be 
(20c0 + 20c1 + 20c2 + 20c3 +20c4 + 20c5)/(2^19) = 0.041389
100*ans (rounded off to ‘exactly’ first decimal place) = 4.1
