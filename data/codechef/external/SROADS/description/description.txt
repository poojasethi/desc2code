 
The government of Britannia wants to know some statistics about the city of Shinjuku. They wanted to count the number of unordered pairs of intersections S and T in the city such that there are at least two edge disjoint paths between them. 
 

Input
First line of the test case contains N and M the number of intersections in Shinjuku and the total number of connections. The next M lines contain two integers i and j indicating a single connection between intersections i and j.
It is guaranteed that no connection occurs twice in the input and there is no connection between the same intersection. 
 

Output
Output on a single line, the number of unordered pairs of intersections S and T, S != T such that there are atleast two edge disjoint paths between S and T.  
 

Constraints

1 ≤ N,M ≤ 10^5

 

Example
Input:
4 4
1 2

1 3
3 4
Output:
3
 

Explanation
 The three pairs of nodes are (1,2), (1,3) and (2,3)
