You are given an array A of N numbers and M queries
of the form L R M and you need to output aL %M +
aL+1 %M + .... + aR %M for each of these queries.

Input
1 st line contains no. of test cases T.
For each test case 
1st line contains an integer N  
Next line contains N integers representing the array A. 
3rd line contains M the no. of queries  
Next M lines contain queries of the form
L R MOD( find answer from L to R with modulo MOD) 

Output
For each query of each testcase print the answer in a new line. 

Constraints

N <= 10000
For all queries, MOD <= 100000
M <= 10000
1 <= L <= R <= N 
T <= 20 
 A[i] <= 10^4

 

Example
Input:
1 
4 
100 150 200 300 
1 
1 4 150 
Output:
