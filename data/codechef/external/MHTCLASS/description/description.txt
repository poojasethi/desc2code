Problem description

There are often situation at the college when people have to prove themselves to the teacher infront of the whole class.
Once a boy named pankaj was the center of attack.
The teacher gave him a string S consisting of alphabets ( a-z ) and dots ( . ) and asked him to enumerate the strings by filling the dots with alphabets from a-z, such that

 abs(S[i] - S[i - 1]) ≤ d for i > 0 and for some given d

 a   ≤ S[i]  ≤ z for i = 0

Attendance for 2 classes are on stake for him. Help him save his attendance by answering the question.
 
As the answer might be large, output the answer modulus 10^9 + 7.


Input
Input description

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains the string S followed by second line containing the number d


 

Output
Output description

For each test case, output a single line containing the answer.
