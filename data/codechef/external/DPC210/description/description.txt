Anu is a little girl who has an extraordinary skill in playing with 
        numbers. You give her a set of nonzero

positive integers with or without repetitions and tell her to generate all 
        possible distinct nonzero positive integers

by retaining / adding / subtracting any combination of the given integers. 
        She can do so instantly.

For example if you give her the three integers 2, 8, 3 then in a moment she 
        will tell you that a total of 11

integers can be generated. In fact, the 11 integers are the following: 1, 
        2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 13.

You are required to write a program that equals the skill of Anu.


Input

The input may contain multiple test cases.

The first line of each test case gives two integers: the case number c and 
        the total number k (< 15) of

integers given to Anu. The next line gives k integers in any order. A blank 
        character separates two consecutive

integers in input.

The input terminates with an input 0 for c.


Output

For each test case print output in one line, giving the case number c and 
        the total number of integers that

can be generated.
