 
In WBUT, there is a famous group of six foodie friends, who call themselves Super Six. Sorry, the names must be withheld. But the problem is interesting.

Often they get n LADDUs from the canteen and try to calculate in how many ways they can eat them. Since all of them are foodie, everyone should get at least 1 LADDU else they will fight with the canteen members.

Given n , find the number of ways the group can eat the LADDUs.

Note: LADDU is a popular Indian sweet.
