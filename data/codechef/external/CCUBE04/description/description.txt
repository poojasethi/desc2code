 
ArmWeak number : A number of the form abcd is said to be an ArmWeak number, when (a^4+b^3+c^2+d^1) is divisible by 7. This concept of armweak number can be extended to any number (with any number of digits). Find the number of ArmWeak numbers below N.
 

Input
The first line consists of T number of test cases. Then T lines follow each taking an input N.

Output
Your program has to print the number of ArmWeak numbers for each test case in T lines.

Constraints

0 ≤ T ≤ 101
0 ≤ N < 10^9


Example
Input:

279999


Output:
11388

Explanation

   Testcase 1: Upto number 7 only 7^1 is an ArmWeak number. So the answer is 1.
Testcase 2: There exists 1388 ArmWeak numbers which are less than or equal to 9999.
