It was math class and Lukas' teacher had just defined a polynomial of degree N as an expression of the form:

p(x) = a1*x^1 + a2*x^2 + .... + aN*x^N mod(10^9+7)

However, Lukas wasn't paying much attention to what the teacher was saying and so he thought that the teacher had defined a lopymonial of degree N as an expression of the form:

l(x) = a1*1^x + a2*2^x + .... + aN*N^x mod(10^9+7)

The teacher now gave all the kids N integers a1,a2,...,aN and asked them to compute the polynomial p(x) at x = 0,1,...,N-1. Lukas, however, ended up computing his lopymonial l(x) at x = 0,1,...,N-1.

By the time he realized his mistake Lukas had forgotten the values of a1,a2,...,aN. So now, all he has are the values of l(x) at x = 0,1,...,N-1. From that he somehow wants to compute the value of the actual polynomial p(x) at x = 0,1,...,N-1. Can you help him out?


Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer N denoting the degree of the polynomial. The second line contains N space-separated integers L1, L2, ..., LN denoting the value of the lopymonial at x = 0,1,..,N-1 respectively

Output
In a single line print N space-separated integers denoting the value of the polynomial p(x) at x = 0,1,...,N-1

Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 2000
0 ≤ Li < 1000000007 (10^9+7)


Example
Input:
3
16 34 80

Output:
0 16 78


Explanation
The lopymonial was l(x) = 3*1^x + 8*2^x + 5*3^x mod(10^9+7)

Therefore, the corresponding polynomial would be p(x) = 3*x^1 + 8*x^2 + 5*x^3 mod(10^9+7)

Now, p(0) = 0, p(1) = 16, p(2) = 78.
