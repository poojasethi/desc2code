Once upon a time there was a King who was really paranoid about the safety of his grand palace. The map of the palace can be described by a matrix with N rows and M columns. Each cell of the matrix encodes either a wall, or free space, where trophies, jewellery and precious fur can be stored.
During the last replanning of the palace, it was divided into a number of rooms, each of which has a rectangular shape on the palace map and is separated from other rooms via walls. There is also a big outer wall surrounding the whole palace which is not indicated on the map.
The King is, however, still not satisfied with the safety of his palace. In order to make it even more safe, he plans to place guards at some of the free spaces in the palace.
The palace guards' armour affords them a very peculiar field of vision. A guard can see only what happens at the cells that are reachable from his position via either one move of a chess knight, or one move of a chess queen. Moreover, a guard can't see what happens in other rooms. Even if a particular cell is reachable from a guard's position, but is placed in another room, the guard can't see it.
The guards are instructed to attack anyone they see immediately; so if two guards see each other, they will collapse. That's why it is forbidden to place two guards in such a way that one can see the other.
The King wants to place as much guards as possible to protect his assets. Please found this maximal number and find any correct placement of guards in the palace so that no guard sees another one.

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers N and M denoting the number of rows and the number of columns in the palace map.
The following N lines contain M characters each, each of which will be either denoting a wall (character "#") or a free space (character ".").

Output
For each test case output the maximal number of guards on the first line.
On the following N lines, output the map of the palace in the same format as the input, but with the character G in the cells where the guards should be placed.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N, M ≤ 100

Note
In the second example, the bottommost guard is reachable from the one that stands in the second row with one chess knight move. But since they are in different rooms, it is okay to place them this way.
