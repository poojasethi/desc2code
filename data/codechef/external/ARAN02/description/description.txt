Breaking through the first layer has definitely weakened the hacker, for his attacks are becoming less frequent now. But he may be preparing for something bigger and worse in the meantime. It is essential to break through all the layers as soon as possible.
The next layer seems to have a more complex architecture, possibly based on a mathematical foundation.  It is rumoured that the hacker is a huge follower of a great Italian mathematician. You must find a way to break through this next layer...


Input:

The first line will consist of the total number of test cases T. 
The next T lines will consist of number N on each line.(101 ≤ N ≤ 10000000) 


Output:

For each test case, output is a number. 



Example:
Input:

3
105
675
3254



Output:

1
3
5
