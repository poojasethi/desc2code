Bob loves playing computer games. He is playing a computer game called Pocket Tanks. He plays it all day, taking only tea breaks in between.
He take T tea breaks on a particular day (He plays for T+1 sessions). Between any 2 tea breaks he has to pass N difficulty levels. Pocket Tanks is a game where the player has to move his/her tank to a specific place. The number of moves he can make in a game always lie between [1, K]. This K and N is given to him by her friend Alice during the tea break (They always have tea together ;).
Given a number X at the start of day, he has to find the number of ways to get this number (X) as a sum of moves for N games he plays in one session. He then sums up this value for all the sessions he plays. If the final value Y % 1000000007 is correct, he wins.

Input
The first line will contain two integers T and X.
Each of the next T+1 lines contain a two integers N and K.

Output
Print one integer corresponding to the answer (Y) modulo 1000000007.

Constraints
0 <= T <= 10
1 <= (N * K) <= 10000
1 <= X <= 1000

Sample input
0 8
3 6
Sample output
21
Explanation
As per the testcase, Bob has 0 tea breaks, so he plays just one session. In that session he has to play 3 levels and with a maximum of 6 moves per level. He can either make 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 moves in each level. Finally he has to make such moves that he is able to make a total of 8 moves. Since he plays for only one session, he has to make a total of 8 moves after 3 levels to win.
The number of ways in which he can make such moves is 21.
