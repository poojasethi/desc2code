Given the LCM of two numbers X & Y, they have to figure out how many ordered pairs (X,Y) exist. Since the task seems too tiring school students, they take help from some students at IIITD and can now easily factorize a number into its prime factors. The LCM has been given in prime factorization form. Only the powers of the primes have been given. The sequence is in correspondence with the first 10^5 primes {2,3,5,7,11 ...}. So, if the exponents are {2 3 4}, the number is 2^23^35^4. 
.

Input
First line contains ‘T’, the number of test cases.
Next line contains ‘N’, the number of prime factors LCM(X,Y) has.
Next line contains ‘N’ integers. The ith number represents the power of the ith prime in LCM(X,Y).

Output
For each test case, print the number of possible ordered pairs(x,y) MOD 2


Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 100

 

Example
Input:
1
3
2 4 2

Output:
1

Explanation
Number of possible pairs is 225. So, 225%2 is 1
