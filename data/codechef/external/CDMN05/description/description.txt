 
Alice and Bob are playing a game. They have a rectangular board of size n*m.The board contains n*m small grids of unit area. In each turn a player has to choose a particular grid and all the grids lying in the same column and the same row as that grid  (including that grid) are destroyed and the game is played independently in the remaining four or fewer smaller rectangular boards. Both the players play alternatively.The player who cannot move loses.

Assuming both the players play optimally and as always Alice starts the game, find the winner.

 

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows
Each test cases contains two space separated integers n  and m denoting the number or rows and columns of the board

 

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing the answer to the problem i.e print 'Alice' (without qoutes) if Alice wins or 'Bob' (without qoutes) if Bob wins.
