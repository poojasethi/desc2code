Chef Anurag is learning multiplication. His teacher wants to test him. So she gave him some numbers to multiply. Anurag is tired of studying and wants to play. So he turns to you for help. Please help him find the answer for the multiplication of the numbers.


Input
The first line has a single integer T denoting the test cases. First line of each test case is a
single integer N denoting number of numbers to multiply. Next line contains N space separated
integers denoting the numbers to multiply.

Output
For each test case, print the result of multiplication. Since this number can be large, print it
modulo 1000000007 (10^9+7).

Constraints

1 <= T <= 100

1 <= N <= 100

1 <= each number to multiply <= 10^16


Example
