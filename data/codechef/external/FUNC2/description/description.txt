Tired of solving all the problems given by his older brother Biswa, Debu has decided to challenge him with the following mathematical problem : 
A positive integer N can be written as product of powers of distinct prime numbers:
 N = p1^r1 * p2^r2 .... * pk^rk 

where p1, p1, ..., pk  are distinct prime factors of N

A function f is defined as:
f(N, K) = Σ ri^K where ri is as described above.

Debu has asked Biswa to find the maximum value of f(N, K) for all integers 1 ≤ N ≤ C for a given value of K.

Biswa can easily solve this problem but he is too busy. So, your task is to solve this problem for Biswa.


As the answer can be very large, you just need to output answer modulo 10^9+7


Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each of the next T lines contain two space separated integers C and K.

Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the answer for that case.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ C ≤ 10^18
1 ≤ K ≤ 10^9


Example
Input:
3
1 2
3 5
10 4

Output:
0
1
81

Explanation
In the second test case f(3, 5) = 1. In the third test case f(8, 4) = 81. There may exist other values of N which give maximum value.
