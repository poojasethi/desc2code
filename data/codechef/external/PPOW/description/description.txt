Your task is simple, to calculate the value of a ^b  for the given values of a and b and compute the sum of the digits of a^b.   
8^3
The problem consists of many test cases.
The input description of each test case is given below.
 

Input
The first line of input contains the number of test cases t.
Then t lines follow each containing two space separated integers a and b.

Output
The output contains t lines each containing “Case p: m” (m=sum of digits of a^b ) for that test case.
Double quotes are only for the purpose of highlighting the output, they are not a part of the output.

Constraints
1<= t <=36009
1<= a <=9
0<= b <=4000

Example
Input:
3
2 32
3 2
2 60


Output:
Case 1: 58
Case 2: 9
Case 3: 82
