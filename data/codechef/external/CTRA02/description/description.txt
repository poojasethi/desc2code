 
In ancient India, a mathematician, Virahanka described a sequence of numbers, called "Virahanka Sequence". The sequence consisted of numbers like -  1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55,...In this sequence, each number is the sum of two consecutive numbers occurring exactly before it.
The Chef has also learned mathematics. He is asked to count the number of trailing zeros Z, i.e. the total number of zeros at the end of the number (Eg : 154000 has 3 trailing zeros) in the factorial of a Virahanka number. Your job is to help Chef find the number of trailing zeros in the n^th Virahanka number.
 

Input
The first line contains a number N denoting the total number of test cases. Following N lines will have numbers n.
Tips:

 Each n may or may not be different

 

Output
Output will contain N lines each containing Z, i.e. the total number of zeros in the end of the factorial of n^th Virahanka Number.
Tips:

The output will contain N lines and each line will contain a single number.

 

Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6^
1 ≤ n ≤ 38

 

Example
Input:
3
2
5
7

Output:
0
1
2

 

Explanation
Test case 1. The 2^nd Virahanka Number in Virahanka sequence is 1, and the factorial of 1 is 1. There is no zero at the end of 1. Hence, output is 0.
Test case 2. The 5^th Virahanka Number in Virahanka sequence is 5, and the factorial of 5 is  120 = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1. There is 1 zero at the end of 120 hence, output is 1.
Test case 3. The 7^th Virahanka Number in Virahanka sequence is 13, and the factorial of 13 is 6227020800 = 13 * 12 * 11 *...* 2 * 1. There are 2 zeros at the end of 6227020800. Hence, output is 2.
