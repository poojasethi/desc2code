 
Kripa and Ajay love Mango's but they do not have mango tree of their own, so they decided to plant a lot of mango trees to create an orchard of mango trees.
But after they planted a lot of trees as planned but stray animal came and eat the saplings of the mango trees and some of their hardwork get destroyed. Kripa decided to make a fence around the orchard but as they are running on tight bugget they have to find the minimum length of fence and area covered by it.
 

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
Each of the next T lines will contain integers N denoting the number of saplings.
The next N lines will contains two integers X , Y denoting the coordinates of tree planted

 

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing two integers perimeter and area of orchard seprated by space.
As perimeter and area can be real numbers you have to print floor of perimeter and area

 

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1≤N≤1000
-5000≤X,Y≤5000

 

Example
Input:
160 03 03 30 31 12 2

Output:12 9

 

Explanation
Example case 1. The outer trees will form a square area with length 3 unit.
Initially the location of trees 

Minimum fencing will be done like this
