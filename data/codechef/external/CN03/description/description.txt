 
So, as you all know free WiFis are being 
installed in our institute.
These are a special 
type of WiFi and they start to interfere when 
there is a signal coming from two different 
WiFis at a single location. The WiFi 
installation task is given to you.


There are N suitable locations for the 
installation of WiFi. 
These locations are 
located along straight line positions 
x1,x2,...,xN (0<=xi<=1000000000).
You  have to install C WiFis. 
You have to 
install the WiFis at locations such that the 
minimum distance between any two of them 
is as large as possible.
 What is the largest 
minimum distance ?

 

Input
Line 1 of contains Two space-separated integers: N and C.

Each of the next N lines, contain an integer denoting the 
location Xi.


Output
Print the largest minimum distance in a 
single line.

Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ Xi ≤ 10^9

 

Example
Input:
5 3
1
2
8
4
9

Output:
3
 

Explanation
Example case 1. The WiFis can be installed at locations 1,4 and 8 or 1,4 and 9 resulting in a minimum distance of 3.
