Simple Factorial
You are asked to calculate factorials of some small positive integers.
Input
 

Input
Tips:

An integer T, denoting the number of testcases, followed by T lines, each containing a single integer N.

 

Output
For each integer N given at input, output a single line the value of N!


If you have multiple test cases in a file start this section as: "For each test case, output a single line containing...".

 

Constraints
Should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have. Format it like:

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 100

 


Input:
