 
El Macho has set the bomb and tied Lucy with it. To save Lucy , Gru has to defuse the bomb. The bomb displays 2 numbers a & b, and its diffusal code is the count of numbers in range [a,b] (both inclusive) having the following properties :
1. The number should be prime.
2. It can be written as the sum of squares of 2 positive integers ( number = p^2 + q^2).
Help Gru to save Lucy by telling him the diffusal code.
 

Input
First line contains T : Number of test cases followed by T line containing 2 space separated integers a and b.


Output
One line per test case containing the count of numbers in the [a,b] having the above properties.
 

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10^9

 

Example
Input:
1
1 5
Output:
2
 

Explanation
2 = 1^2 + 1^2
5 = 1^2 + 2^2
