Freakin' news has recently claimed that they have discovered a civilization on mars and that they have established contact with the martians. Following is a summary of the tea hour breakin' news on freakin' news :
Every morning, the martian king determines his lucky number(s) for the day using the following unusual algorithm :
Select a positive integer n.
Write out a permutation f of (1,2,...n) on a board from left to right. (f(1) is leftmost, f(n) is rightmost).
While 3 or more numbers remain on the board 
	Erase all numbers at position i from the left for which i is a power of 2.
The number(s) which remains(remain) at the end is(are) the lucky number(s) for the day.  
 (Note : It is trivial to prove that either 1 or 2 numbers remain at the end.) 
 The king has asked freakin' news to write a program which determines the lucky numbers for the day given n and f. Your job is to do this task for freakin' news.

Input 
The first line of input contains a single integer T : the number of test cases.
Lines 2,3,...2T+1 describe the test cases (Test case i is described by the lines 2i and 2i+1).
The first line of each test case contains the single integer n. The next line consists of n space seperated integers f(1), f(2), ... f(n). It is guaranteed that (f(1),f(2),...f(n)) is a permutation of (1,2,...n).

Output 
For each test case output a single line as follows :
If 1 number remains at the end :
	On the only line of output, output a single integer : the lucky number for the day.
If 2 numbers remain at the end :
	On the only line of output, output two space seperated integers : the two lucky numbers for the day. The two numbers must appear from left ro right in the same order in which they appeared in the input.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ n ≤ 100000
(f(1),f(2),...f(n)) is a permutation of (1,2,...n).
