Shil has an array of  N  integers A1 , A2....AN.He can insert an element 1 ≤ X ≤ K between any two  adjacent numbers or at the start or at end of array.He wants to find out total number of ways to insert an element such that length of longest strictly increasing sub-sequence of the array increases by 1.Two ways are considered different if position of inserted element is different or value of the inserted element is different. 

Input
First line of input consists of integer T denoting total number of test cases.
 First line of each test case consists of two integers N and K.Next line  consists of N integers A1, A2....AN.


Output
 For each test case, print total number of ways to insert an element in the array. 

Constraints

 1 ≤ T ≤  20  
 1 ≤ N ≤  1000  
 1 ≤ K ≤  1000000  
 1 ≤ Ai ≤  1000000  


Example
Input:
1
3 6
2 4 3

Output:
7

Explanation
All the possible ways will be [1 2 4 3] , [2 3 4 3] , [2 4 5 3], [2 4 6 3], [2 4 3 4], [2 4 3 5] and [2 4 3 6].
