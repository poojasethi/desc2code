 
All of you know about Fibbonacci series.
It is a series where F(n)=F(n-1)+F(n-2) and F(0)=F(1)=1;
Now, when the professor was teaching Fibbonacci series, then a student had mistakenly copied the co-efficients and the starting values wrong. He wrote F(n)=2*F(n-1)+3*F(n-2); and F(0)=2 and F(1)=5;
Now, he was getting the series all wrong.
Anyway, he decided to name this series as 'False Fibbonacci Series' and he is now interested in finding the Nth term of this fibbonacci series.
Now, he asks you for help and you being his friend, agree on helping him. Now find the Nth term of this 'False Fibbonacci Series'.
As the answer can be big, print it modulo 10^9+7.
 

Input
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
Then T test cases follow.
Each test case consists of a single line and it contains a single integer N.

 

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the value of Nth False Fibbonacci number, modulo 10^9+7, on a single line.

 

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 20
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^8

 

Example
Input:
3
1
2
3


Output:
5
16
47
 

Explanation
Example case 1. The series goes like 2,5,16,47. 2 is the 0th term, 5 is the 1st term and so on.
