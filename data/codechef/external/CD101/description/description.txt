Three dinos go on a camping trip. There they decide to play a game. They mark distances of 1 km each on the ground up to 100 km i.e. 1, 2, 3...100. They can sit only on these 100 spots, with each one at a different spot. In one move, one of the outer dinos can hop into a spot between the other two. 
Help them maximise their duration of play.
