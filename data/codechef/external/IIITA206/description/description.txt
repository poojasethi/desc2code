Problem Description:
You are given n integers. You have to delete minimum number of elements so that the remaining elements satisfy the property
a <= 2 * b
where a is the maximum value in the remaining elements and b is the minimum value in the remaining elements.


Input:

First Line: contains number of integers n.
Second Line: contains n space seprated integers ai.


Output:


Print one integer, the minimum number of elements that will have to removed.


Constraints:

1 <= n <= 10^5
1 <= a[i] <= 10^5


Example
Input:
6
3 7 4 5 3 8

Output:
2
Input:
4
3 2 4 4

Output:
0


Explanation
Test Case 1 :
	In the first test case, one possible solution is you can remove 7, 8.
	So that minimum is 3 and maximum is 5.
	5 <= 2 * 3.
