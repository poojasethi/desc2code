Problem description.
 
Alia and Bruce from planet Krypton have landed on planet Pandora. Pandora is a rectangular planet with N rows and M columns, which divide the planet into N*M cells. Alia has landed on top-leftmost point and Bruce at bottom leftmost point. Their aim is to reach the diagonally opposite corners. There are K cells where krypton's people are already there. These K cells must be visited by atleast one of them. There are certain cells which are military base of planet Pandora . Alia and Bruce can't take the risk to visit these cells. Which ever cell they visit, they have been ordered to kill the pandora population there. To make sure they dont raise suspicion among the Pandora people they want to kill as less people as possible.
Help them to calculate the minimum number of people to be killed?

Input
First line give the number of input T.
Second line given the number of rows N and number of columns M.
Then there are N lines containing M integers each which are -1 if it is a military base otherwise it denotes  Pandora's population of that cell.
Next line contain the integer K followed by K lines having two integers X and Y meaning cell at row X( 1 indexed ) and Y column(1 indexed) must be visited. 

Output
 For each test case print the minimum number of people that should be killed. If there is no way possible then print -1.
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 10
3 <= N,M <= 1000
-1 <= value at cell(i,j) <= 1000
0 <= K <= 100
1 <= X <= N
1 <= Y <= M
Sample Test Case:
Input:
1
3 3
1 2 3
4 -1 6
7 8 9
1
1 2
Output:
32
