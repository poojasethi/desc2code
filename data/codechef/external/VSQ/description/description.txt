Chef studies in a good School where programming is taught,
Chef 's Teacher Sameer Srivastava knows that chef knows basic stuffs of programming,to teach him more about programming his teacher gave him a Very Simple Question.


Description of question :
Chef has an array A of N numbers.
His teacher give him two numbers a and b and chef has to find
number of elements in array such that A[i] ≥ a and A[i] ≤ b where 1 ≤ i ≤ n and A[i] denotes the i^th element of array. 

Input:
The first line of input contains a single integer N denoting the number of elements in the array A.
Second Line contains N space separated Integers.
Third line contains Q ,the number of queries.
 each query contains two space separated integer a and b.

Output
For each query output a single Integer giving the output of the problem.


Constraints

1 ≤ N, Q ≤ 100000
1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10^9
1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10^9



Example
Input:
72 5 6 7 1 3 421 73 5
