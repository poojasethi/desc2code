You just purchased a general store and now you would like to stock up with some goods. You have N companies from which you can purchase. Also your store has M shelves, where the i^th shelf can accommodate Ai units of goods (of any company). Any two goods from the same company has to be put in the same shelf. Also, a shelf cannot have goods from any two different companies.
The companies have two consignments from which they can supply goods to your store. Both of them have same type of goods. But the goods of first consignment are free (trial basis supply) and the second one has a charge. Formally, the i^th company can provide at most Xi units of goods for free and then will provide additional at most Yi units of goods at charge of Pi dollars per good.
Your task is to stock up your store with as many goods as possible. Since you are there to make profit (obviously!), your would like to pay as little as possible. Find this minimum possible cost you need to pay to stock up as much as possible.

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case has two space separated integers N and M. Next N lines follow, the i^th of which has three space separated integers, Xi, Yi and Pi.
The next line has M integers A1, A2...AM denoting the storage capacity of shelves.

Output
For each test case, output a single line containing two space separated integers, the first being maximum number of goods you can stock in store and the second being the minimum cost incurred to purchase them.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤  10 
1 ≤ N ≤  300 
1 ≤ M ≤  10^4 
1 ≤ Xi, Yi, Ai, P ≤  10^3 

 

Example
Input:
1
3 1
5 3 1
1 2 4
2 1 1
6

Output:
6 1

Explanation
Example case 1.We will choose the first company which gives 5 goods free and an additional 1 unit we will purchase at cost of 1 dollar. Hence we get our shelf fully filled with cost of 1 dollar.
