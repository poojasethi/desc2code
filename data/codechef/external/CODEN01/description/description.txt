Chef's Lucky Numbers are 2 and 7.
He is preparing a dish and he wants to use some specific ingredients only. A particular ingredient is represented by a number N. Chef will select the ingredient if and only if N has exactly 2 factors as 7. 
That is, if N is represented as 
N = 7^p * M, (where ^ represents exponentiation),
Then chef will select the ingredient if and only if p is 2.
Given the ingredient can you help chef decide whether he will choose it?
INPUT
First line of the input will contain T, number of test cases. Next T lines contains a single integer N representing the ingredient.
OUTPUT
For each test case, give output as “YES” (without quotes) if chef will choose the ingredient, else give it as “NO” (without quotes).
CONSTRAINTS
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 10^6
EXAMPLE
Input
2
98
42
Output
YES
NO
EXPLANATION
Case 1:
98 = 7^2 * 2. Here, p=2 so the answer is YES.
Case 2:
42 = 7^1 * 6. Here p=1 so answer is NO.
