Consider the triangle:
1
2	3
4	5	6
7	8	9	10
11	12	13	14	15
...
and so on. F(N) is the sum of all prime numbers that occur on the Nth row (in 1-based indexing) of this triangle. 

Input
The first line has an integer T indicating the number of test cases. This is followed by T lines, each containing a line number N.

Output
For each test case, output a line containing F(N) as defined above.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 1000


Example
Input:
2
2
5
Output:
5
24

Explanation
Example case 1.
Line 2 is [2, 3]. Both these numbers are prime. The answer is hence their sum, 5.
Example case 2.
Line 5 is [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. Of these, 11 and 13 are prime. The answer is hence their sum, 24.
