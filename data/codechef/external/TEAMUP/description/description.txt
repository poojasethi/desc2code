The professor wants to divide the class of n students into two groups Left (L) and Right(R) for some project work. But the students are very talkative and so the professor decides that no two friends should fall into the same group. Each student is recognized by his index which is in the range of 1 to n. The professor knows through unknown sources who are friends with whom. So he has asked you to help him divide the class into two teams. Note that friendships are always mutual; i.e. if A is a friend of B then B is also friend of A.
 

Input
The first line of input consists of the number of test cases T. Then T lines follow each describing a test case. The first line of each test case consists of a number n. Then follow n lines each describing the friendship of a student. Each line starts with a number k telling the number of friends the ith person has. Then follow k integers separated by space which tells the index (1 based) of his friends.  All these integers on the ith line are greater than i itself. (See sample for clarity).
 

Output
For each test case, if it is possible to divide the class into teams, then print a line of L’s and R’s denoting which team that student is a part of. If it is impossible to divide the class then print -1 instead. If there are multiple solutions print the one that would come first in the dictionary.
 

Constraints
T≤100
1≤ n ≤ 1000
0 ≤ k < n

Output:

LRRL

 

Explanation
Example case 1:The input is as follows. We have 3 students. Student 1 is friend with Student2 .Student 2 is friend with Student3. So if we group them as LRL then no friend are there in the same team.
Example case 2:Here student 1 is the friend with both 2 and 3 .As student 1 should be in L, so both 2 and 3 should be in R. Student 2 is also a friend of 3. Hence we cannot put 2 and 3 in the same team. So it is impossible to group them. Hence answer is -1
Example case 3:Here both LRRL and LRRR are correct. But as LRRL would come before LRRR in the dictionary, that is the answer.
