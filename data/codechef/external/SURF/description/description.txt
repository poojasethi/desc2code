The campus of VSSUT is rectangular in shape. Morever there are D departments in the campus numbered 1 through D which are in itself L-shaped. The width and length of i^th department is Pi and Qi units respectively. Each rectangle i has a cut of Ri x Si units from top right corner (refer image).

The blue part of the 2^nd image represents the department.

There is a student located at the top left corner of each department. For each department, count the number of ways the student can reach the bottom right corner, if each student can only move right or down 1 unit at any time. The student is not allowed to move outside his corresponding department.

Input
First line of input contains a single integer D, the number of departments or test cases. The second line contains description of D consisting a single line of four space separated integers Pi, Qi, Ri & Si.

Output
For each department, output a single line containing the number of ways modulo 1000000007

Constraints
