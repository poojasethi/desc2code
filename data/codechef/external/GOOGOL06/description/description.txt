 

The theme of the problem statement should not be taken seriously. 

The CSE Society(CSES) and ACM Student Chapter have done a commendable job in improving the Coding Culture among the students of ISM by organizing various programming contests. However, both of these societies compete to show that one of them is better than the other. Still there is no clear winner. 
This time CodeISM has been asked to break the tie and tell which Society is better. Since CodeISM consists students passionate about Competitive Coding, they provide an innovative solution to break the tie.
They ask both of them to answer the following queries on an array of numbers
 A x y - Replaces the element at position x with the value y 
 B x y - Inverts alternate numbers between x and y(including both), starting from x.  Here inverts means that the number is replaced by bitwise not of itself  
 C x - Prints the value of stored at position x 
 D x y - Prints the bitwise xor of all the elements between x and y(including both) 
 The winner ACM wants to win this one, the ACM chair has asked you to make a program to do so. Please help him win. 

Input
The first line input contains the number elements in the array N. the next line contain N elements A[1]....A[N]. Each of the array element will fit in the unsigned 64 bit integer. The next line gives the number of queries Q. Then Q lines follow, having any of the four queries mentioned above.  NOTE: All the indices will 1-based 

Output
Output the corresponding answer for the queries of type C and D . The answer will fit in unsigned 64 - bit integer.

Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 100000
1 ≤ Q ≤ 100000
1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ N for all the queries involving indices of the array

 

Example
Input:
5
1 2 3 4 5
5
A 1 2
C 1
B 3 4
D 1 5
D 3 5


Output:
2
18446744073709551613
18446744073709551613
 

Explanation
Example case 1. A 1 2 replaces A[1] with value 2 hence now the array is 2 2 3 4 5. C 1 gives the value at position 1 i.e. A[1] which is 2. B 3 4 replaces 3 with ~3 (See that 4 is not inverted as only alternate elements need to be inverted). D 1 5 and D 3 5 gives the  required Xor.
