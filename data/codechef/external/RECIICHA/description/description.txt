 
Help Saurabh with his Chemistry Assignment.
Saurabh has been given a chemistry assignment by Ruby Mam. Though the assignment is simple but
Saurabh has to watch India vs Pakistan Match and he has no time to do the assignment by himself.
So Saurabh wants you to do his assignment so that he doesn’t get scolded by Ruby Mam . The assignment
is as follows , Suppose there are X particles initially at time t=0 in a box. At a time t the number of particles in
box becomes t times the number of particles at time t-1 . You will be given N and X where N is time at which the
number of particles in box is to be calculated and X is the number of particles at time t=0.
 

Input
The first line will contain the integer T, the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two space
separated integers N and X .
 

Output
For each test case, output the answer to the query. Since the output can be very large, output the answer modulo
10^6+3
 

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100000
1 ≤ N,X ≤ 10^18

 

Example
Input:
2
1 2
2 1

Output:
2
2
 

Explanation
Example case 2.At t=0 particles are 1 ,so at t=1 ,particles are 1*1 = 1 particles. At t=2, particles are 2*1 = 2 particles.
