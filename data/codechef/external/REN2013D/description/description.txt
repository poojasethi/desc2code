 
You have been given a set of positive integers.Let the minimum element be LO and sum of all elements in set be HI.

Your task is to find out if, for each integer X, ( where X is between LO and HI inclusive ) can a subset of the set be chosen such that the sum of elements in this subset is equal to X.

Input

The first line of the test file contains a single integer T ( T<=100 ) the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer N(N<=10^5) the number of elements in the set.
The next line contains a space separated list of the elements of the set.Each element will be between 0 and 10^9.

Output
For each test case print "YES" (without quotes) on a single line if it is possible to select the required subsets for each value of X. Print "NO" (without quotes) on a single line otherwise.


Example
Input:

2
5
4 8 2 1 16
4
5 1 2 7


Output:
YES
NO
 

Explanation

For first test case all values between 1 and 31 can be made using the given numbers.

For the second test case for values between 1 and 15 the values 4 and 11 cannot be made.
