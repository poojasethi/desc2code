Problem Description 
Given a string, find the number of palindromic substrings of the string whose length is a prime number.The string consists only of lowercase english alphabet.
These palindromes need not be distinct.


Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then, T lines follow. Each line contains a string.
Note: N is the string length.

Output
For each test case, output a single integer containing the answer to the corresponding test case.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 200
1 ≤ N ≤ 100000 (10^5)

Example
Sample Input:
2
abac
ababac

Sample Output:
1
4

Explanation
Example case 1. The palindromic substrings in the string are "a","b", "a",and "aba". But only palindrome "aba" is of prime length . So, output is 1.
Example case 2. The palindromic substrings in the string are "a", "b", "a" , "b", "a", "c", "aba", "aba", "bab", "ababa".The prime length palindromes are "aba", "aba", "bab", and "ababa"  . So, output is 4. Here, we take both “aba” and “aba” as two different palindromes.
