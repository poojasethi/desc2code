Raavan abducted sita in the past, at that time when Ram went to save her wife , he was posed a question by Raavan in binomial theorem :
 given N Ram has to find the number of odd coefficients in the expansion of (1+x)^n . As the number given by Raavan was huge, Ram was unable to calculate at that time , so he was forced to save sita through war which resulted in loss of  huge troop of monkeys and humans. Now you are given a time machine to travel back to that age. can you solve the question posed by Raavan and avoid the war and save many lives including Raavan.

Input
one line consisting of a number N .

Output
single line denoting your answer to Raavan.

Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 10000000


Example
Input:
3
Output:
4

Explanation
The coefficients for binomial expansion of (1+x)^3 are 1 3 3 1, out of which all are odd ,so answer is 4.
