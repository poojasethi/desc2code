 
Yoda is on an adventurous trek in the mountains of Endor. There are 100 villages in the mountain range he is trekking. Villages are numbered from 1 to 100 according to their altitude. Village 1 is at the lowest level ,2 above 1 and village 100 at the top. From each village there are roads to the next k consecutive villages.(e.g if k=3,then there are 3 roads emerging from 1, connecting it with village 2,3 and 4).Apart from the roads there are passes and valleys in range which are shortcuts to travel. Passes are shortcuts that allow him to go from less numbered village to high numbered village. Valleys are opposite to passes in which he can go from higher to lower village. All roads, valleys and passes allow one way travel i.e you cannot traverse it back.(e.g if there is road from k to k+1,you cannot traverse back from k+1 to k ,passes allow movement from low to high only and valleys allow movement from high to low only).Also all roads, passes and valleys require 1 unit time to travel.Yoda is in Village 1 and he wants to reach 100th village. But he wants to reach there in least possible time.
Help him get there and tell him the least time to reach the top.
(You can assume that there are no villages having both pass and valley).

 

Input
Input starts with positive integer k and then in new line, two integers m and n separated by space which are number of passes and valleys in the range.

Next m lines are description of passes and the n lines after are description of valleys.

Description of pass and valley:
two integers separated by space (start point and end point respectively)
 

Output
Output least possible time to reach top(i.e village 100)
 

Constraints
1<=k<=10

0<=m,n<=10

 

Example
Input:
4 
1 1 
6 97
56 25 

Output:
4
 

Explanation
From each village there are 4 roads.
So from 1, chef can reach 2,3,4 and 5. (1 unit time)
From any of the above he can reach village 6. (2)
From there in one unit time,he can directly reach village 97 using the pass at 6 (3), and from there he can go to either 98,99 or 100.So in another 1 unit time,he'll reach the top.(4)
Thus the answer.
