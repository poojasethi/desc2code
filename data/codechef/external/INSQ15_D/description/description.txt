Vishwas is suffering from sesquipedalophobia i.e. fear of long words. 
Vishwas cannot tolerate a string of length greater than K. So Dhruv gave him a long string (containing only characters a,b and c) of length N to annoy him. You being his friend, came to his rescue.You cannot change the length of the string. So you came up with a plan to change some of the characters of the string such that string repeats after every K characters. In other words, now he has to only memorize only first K characters and write them N / K times to form the whole string.


For example:- abcabcabc is  acceptable for K = 3.


As changing characters is a costly process, so you have to complete the process in minimum number of changes.Now you have to output the first K characters of these newly formed repetitive string. If there are multiple answer print the lexicographically smallest string.


Input


The first line of the input contains a pair of integers N, K. N is always divisible by K


The second line contains the string containing only characters a,b and c.



Output


Print the first K characters which can be formed in minimum number of changes.Also the output should be lexicographically smallest.



Constraints

1 ≤ K,N ≤ 10^6


Example
Input:
Input #1:
9 3
abccbcabc

Input #2:
4 2
bacb

Output:
Output #1:
abc

Ouput #2:
ba

 

Explanation

In the first case,we can make the string repetitive after K characters by making 1 change. Change the 4th character to 'a'.
Hence the output is abc.
Other option is to output cbc but it requires 2 changes.
