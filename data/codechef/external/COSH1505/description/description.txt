 

Problem description:
The square field consists of M × M cells. Each cell is colored in one of three colors (1,2,3). The initial state is chosen in one of the cells of color 1. In each step one allowed to move one cell up, down, left or right remaining inside the field. 
You are to define the worst minimal amount of steps one should make to get a cell of color 3 independent on the initial state. 
Note that the field contains at least one cell of color 1 and at least one cell of color 3.You have to consider each initial point and give the maximum out of it.

Input
First line contains the value of M. Followed by the Description of the field.

Output
For each input block the output should consist of one line with the integer, the worst minimal amount of steps one should make to get a cell of color 3 independent on the initial state.

Constraints
