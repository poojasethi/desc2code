 Lazy Puzzle
Aashish was sitting in a park with Chirag. Aashish wanted to prove Chirag about his 
puzzle solving skills and asks Chirag to give him a puzzle.
 Chirag being a lazy person gives Aashish a lazy puzzle to solve. He gives him a sequence of n digits and asks him 
to make a number from these digits with each of the digit d used exactly once and all of 
the digits in the sequence should be used. The number should be such that it should have the smallest number of 
factors among all the numbers which can be generated using these digits.
Leading zeros can be skipped and should not be printed in the output.
If there is a tie among the numbers then give the smallest number among them. Help 
Aashish solve the puzzle.

CONSTRAINTS : 

 1<=n<=5 
 0<=d<=9 
 There will be at least one non zero digit in the sequence 


SAMPLE TESTS:
INPUT1:


	2 4
	
OUTPUT1:
24
 Note for INPUT1: Among 24 and 42, 24 has the least number of factors(1,2,3,4,6,8,12,24).
INPUT2:


	0 5
	
OUTPUT2:
5
INPUT3:


	8 1
	
OUTPUT3:
81
INPUT4:


	1 1 2
	
OUTPUT4:
211
Note for INPUT4:- Although digit 1 is repeated but since it occurs twice, so it 
should be used twice in the output
