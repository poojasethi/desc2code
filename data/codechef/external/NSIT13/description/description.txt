Given two integers 'A' and 'B', A MOD B is the remainder of the operation A / B.

For example,
7 MOD 3 = 1
14 MOD 3 = 2
27 MOD 3 = 0
38 MOD 3 = 2


Your program should accept 10 non-negative integers as input and output the number of distinct non-negative integers in the input, if they are considered MOD 42.


Input

The input has 10 test cases. Each Test Case contains 10 non-negative integers, each smaller than 1000, one per line.

Output

Output the number of distinct values when considered MOD 42, one per line for each test case.
