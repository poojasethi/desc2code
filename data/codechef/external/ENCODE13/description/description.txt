You're given an array 'a' of N distinct integers.
Let's consider a triple ( i, j, k ), 0 ≤ i < j < k ≤ N-1.
The sum of corresponding elements is equal to a[i]+a[j]+a[k].
For all the possible sums you can get by choosing such a triple
output its value and the number of triples that result in such a sum.



Input
The first line of input contains an integer N (3 ≤ N ≤ 20000).
Each of the next N lines contain an integer a[i] (|a[i]| ≤ 10000).


Output
Output each of the possible sums in increasing order with the number of triples that generate them. The format should be:
s[i] : ways[i]

(s[i] = value of the i-th sum, ways[i] = number of triples that generate it)


Example

Input:
4
-1
2
3
4


Output:
4 : 1
5 : 1
6 : 1
9 : 1


Constraints:
3 ≤ N ≤ 20000
|a[i]| ≤ 10000 for all i.
