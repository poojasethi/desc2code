I think all of you would be knowing the TV series the big bang theory, so as usual one day Sheldon cooper was having a problem which he was frustrated with so leonard tries to help as they eagerly wanted to go to the comic book store. But it turned out that leonard too was finding it difficult. So they posted the Question on the internet here for u..

CAN U HELP THEM??.!!!!!

Consider the sequence of digits from 1 through N (where N=9) in increasing 
order 

1 2 3 4 5 . . . N 

and insert either a (+) for addition or a (-) for subtraction or a ( ) [blank] 
to run the digits together. Now sum the result and see if you get zero. 

Write a program that will find all sequences of length N that produce a ZERO 
SUM. 
You cannot put a symbol in front of the first number that is 1.

INPUT: 

Each line will have a input value for N. You should read all the values and output all the sequences of the length N that produce a zero sum. The end of file is denoted by #.

OUTPUT:

The output should produce all the possible combinations of sequences for each value of N.
print each combination on a different line.

SAMPLE INPUT:
3
#
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
1+2-3
