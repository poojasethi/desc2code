Professor Sharma is a renowned expert in Data Structures and has written a series of books on various topics.
Every book of his consists of topics and many of the topics are distributed among different books.
He also teaches Data Structures in college and is known to put the hardest EST paper than all teachers.


Students are aware of this and also know that no one alone can read all the books.
So they have agreed to read M topics each and then teach others what they have read.


You have a list consisting of N lines. Where each line consists of book number, topic name and number of pages.
Being the smartest of all, you want to find M topics for which you will have to study the least.
Just to measure your smartness, you want to find the maximum difference between the number of pages you will study
and the maximum number of pages anyone else may study.


Input
 The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. 

First line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N and M. 
N lines follow consisting of three space separated variables b,t and p.
Where b stands for book number, t is the Topic name and p stands for the number of pages of the topic t in the book b.
All names are stripped of spaces and are transformed to lower case. The name may contain numbers though.
i.e. topic "Binary Tree" is treated as binarytree.


Output

Output in single line your smartness measure
Smartness measure is the maximum difference between the number of pages you will study
and the maximum number of pages anyone else may study.


Constraints

 0 < T < 1000
 0 < N < 1000
 0 < M < 1000
 0 < b < 100
 0 < length of t < 100
 0 < p < 100


Example
Input:
1
10 2
1 stack 15
1 queue 12
1 hashing 7
2 btree 23
2 stack 13
2 queue 10
3 btree 5
3 hashing 8
3 queue 2
3 stack 1

Output:
18

Explanation
Example case 1. 

stack 15+13+1   =29
queue 12+10+2   =24
btree 23+5      =28
hashing 7+8     =15
Therefore ((29+28) - (24+15))=18
