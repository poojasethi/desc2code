Something is logically wrong with this program. Program is generating output but is logically not correct completely. Correct it.

int main()
{
            struct ex
            {
                        int i;
                        float j;
                        char *s;
            };
struct ex *p;
 
p=(struct ex*)malloc (sizeof(struct ex));
p->s=(char*)malloc(20);
free(p);
 
printf("Executed");return 0;
}
 
Expected output: Executed
