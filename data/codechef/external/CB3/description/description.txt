Problem Description

Semusa assigned numbers to the English alphabets in consecutive order as A-1, B-2, C-3........Z-26 to encrypt a message given in string of letters.
He developed a very unique cryptosystem which required an authentication text every time a user want it to use it to transit information securely.


The authentication text was developed on a mathematical series and the cryptosystem would randomly state the length of text required for one time authentication.The users entered the letters letters required as authentication text and if found valid, they were allowed to use the system.


Semusa wants programmers like you to develop the authentication text generator capable of generating required text of length upto 88.


NOTE:
The mathematical series contains numbers which are greater than 26. In that case take mod 26 of such numbers and assign corresponding letter.


Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case contains a single integer N denoting the length of authentication text required by the crptosystem.


Output

For each test case, output a single line containing the authentication string of length N".


Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 20
1 ≤ N ≤ 88

 

Example
Input:
2
