 
There is an exam going on in the campus and our invigilator Nidhi  is very strict. Still students manage to cheat.
If one copies an array of integers from some other student, any circular arrangement of the array is valid is an answer. The first number in the answer defines the circular arrangement chosen.
But in hurry student copy the numbers at wrong places. You have to calculate the cheat number ie number of digits that have been displaced from their correct position.
 

INPUT
The first line contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Next line have an integer N. The valid array can take the form 1 to N or any of its circular arrangement.
Further there are T lines each with an instance of copied array.
 

Output
Print number of digits displaced from their position for each instance in different line.

Constraints
1<=T<=100

1<=N<=100

 

Example
Input:

2
4
1 2 3 4
2 1 3 4 


Output:

0
3

 

Explanation
In first line, 2 is number of instances of copied array. From second line we get to know the valid arrays are 1 2 3 4, 2 3 4 1, 3 4 1 2, 4 1 2 3.In first test case the array matches with valid array so the cheat number =0. In second case first digit is 2 ,so we have to match our given array with the valid array 2 3 4 1.The digit 1 had to be on position fourth,3 had to be on second, 4 had to be on third. Thus cheat number =3.
