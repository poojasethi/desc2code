Points:10
Your college teacher was highly impressed by your previous achievement. So now he has given you a new project to work on. If you can make this one into a success, you could be on your way to Rio de Janeiro in Brazil to participate in the global finale of this international technical extravaganza sponsored by Bromhood Brothers, a leading software developer( Now why does it look familiar ?!?). 
You are given  set of letters,
and the challenge is to find how many different words can be made from these
letters. This problem is designed to take all the fun out of it by
automating the process.
 




Input:
Input will be in two parts. The first part will be a dictionary of less than
1000 lines, containing words to be searched for. Each line will contain one
word of up to 7 characters. Each word will be in lower case. The words will
be in alphabetical order. The end of the dictionary will be indicated by a
line consisting of a single `#' character.


After the dictionary there will be data for several word puzzles, each on a
separate line. Each puzzle line will have from one to 7 lower case letters,
separated by one or more spaces. Your task is to arrange some or all of
these letters to form words in the dictionary. The list of puzzles will be
terminated by a line consisting of a single `#'.




Output:




For each puzzle line in the input, a single line of output should be
produced, containing the number of different words in the dictionary that
can be formed using the letters in the puzzle line.

Note that each letter may be used only as many times as it appears in the
puzzle line. For instance, the puzzle line `u l l' may produce the word `lul'
but not the word `lull'.
