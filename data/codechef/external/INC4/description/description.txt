The University results for the exams have just been declared. The colleges have received marks of N students. Now the teachers want to form groups of students for a seminar. However they do not want students having same marks in one group. They decide to pick random sub-arrays from the array of marks of N students. The teacher wants to find the number of students having different marks in that sub-array.


Input

The first line of the input contains an integer N denoting the number of students.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the marks of each student. 
The third line contains M , the number of sub-arrays picked by the teacher
 The next M lines each contain two integers denoting the range of the sub-array.


Output

Output M lines containing the answer for each sub-array given by the teacher.


Constraints
