Nikhil loves to play FlappyBirds (who doesn't!). He plays it on his brother Nitin's mobile since he doesn't own one.
One day, as usual, Nikhil comes to ask Nitin if he can play the game.
Nitin challenges Nikhil to write code for a puzzle he's been trying to solve for last three days.
If Nikhil solve's it, he can play.
But alas! Nikhil is not an expert programmer like you. He needs your help. Help Nikhil play FlappyBirds!
The puzzle is simple. You have a 4 x 4 grid. Some of the cells in the grid are black and some white.
'b' represents black and 'a' represents white.
Eg.
 
           babb
           bbbb
           aaaa
           aabb

The task is to change the color of at-most one cell to the other color (ie. a -> b, b -> a) so that you can form a 2 x 2 grid, with all cells of the same color.

INPUT
 Input has four lines, containing four characters each. If the j-th character of the i-th line is 'b', that cell is black, and so on.

OUTPUT
Print "POSSIBLE" (without the quotes) if it's possible to complete the task and "NOT POSSIBLE" (without the quotes) otherwise.

 Sample Test:
Sample Test 1 Input


 bbbb
 abaa
 bbbb
 aaaa

Sample Test 1 Output
POSSIBLE
Sample Test 2 Input


 bbbb
 aaaa
 bbbb
 aaaa

Sample Test 2 Output
NOT POSSIBLE
 Explanation for Sample Test 1 : If we re-paint the 1st cell at 2nd row, we can get a 2 x 2 grid of all cells 'b'.
