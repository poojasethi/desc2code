 
Chef and his girlfriend talk over on the email. Chef wants only her to understand what he writes. For that, he wants to encrypt his messages so that she can only read it, while for others its just some words without any meaning.
So to achieve this, Chef comes up with a plan. He makes a algorithm that encrypts the messages. The idea was,
Replacing letters a to m with n to z
Replacing letters n to z with a to m
Replacing letters A to M with N to Z
Replacing letters N to Z with A to M
Also, replacing digits 0 to 4 with 5 to 9
and replacing digits 5 to 9 with 0 to 4
Note  that spaces are left unchanged and case of the letter is taken in consideration.

You have to help Chef's girlfriend to decrypt his messages.

 

Input
There will be an input  n, denoting the number of strings.
 From second line input will consists of  n number of encrypted strings.

There will not be any consecutive spaces i.e. no consecutive two spaces.
Letters from 'a' - 'z' , 'A' - 'Z' 
Digits from '0' - '9'
