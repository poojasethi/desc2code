Bob has recently learnt how to play basketball and he was told by Alice that the rules in basketball were as follows :
• 1 point for a free throw
• 2 points for a throw from within the D 
• 3 points for a throw from outside the D 
Being an inquisitive mind that Bob is, he would like to know how many combinations of 1-pointers, 2-pointers and 3-pointers can lead to a team score of N points. 
Now if a team has scored enough points, Bob wouldn't be able to remember the number of possible combinations long enough to show-off in front of your friends.
So you decide to keep track of result modulo 100001.
Help Bob to compute the number of combinations of 1-pointers, 2-pointers and 3-pointers that can lead to a team score of N points.


Input
The first line contains single integer T - the number of test cases. T test cases follow.For each test case input will just be a number which denotes the team score N.

Output
Output should be number of combinations of 1-pointers, 2-pointers and 3-pointers that can lead to the given team score modulo 100001.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
0 ≤ N < 10^8

Sum of all the N's across a test file doesn't exceed 10^8.


Example
Input:
4
8
12
1033
894755

Output:
10
19
89441
22727
 

Explanation
Example case 1:For the 1st test case,following are the possible combinations for team score of 8
1x8
1x6 + 2x1
1x4 + 2x2
1x2 + 2x3
2x4
1x5 + 3x1
1x3 + 2x1 + 3x1
1x1 + 2x2 + 3x1
1x2 + 3x2
2x1 + 3x2 

NOTE : Use fast Input Output.
