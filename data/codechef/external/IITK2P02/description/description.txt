Sumo was travelling alone at night, suddenly he saw a spaceship and out of it came an alien named KK. Obviously, the alien had a different language and thus couldn't communicate readily. After some psycho-telepathic talk, Sumo realised that KK's language has M distinct characters. And a valid word in his language satisfies the following properties:

 Each character in the word must be one of the M characters. 
There must be no  palindromic substring of size greater than 1.



For some reason Sumo wants to know the number of valid words of length N in KK's language. Since the answer can be large, print the answer modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7).
 

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers N and  M  as described in the problem statement.


Output

For each test case, output a single line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. See example section for better understanding.


Constraints
