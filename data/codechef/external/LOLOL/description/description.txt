Little Toojee was a happy go lucky boy. He seemed to find most, if not all, things funny. One day he read a word and started laughing a lot. Turns out that the word consisted only of the letters L and O. Whenever he saw the subsequence ‘LOL’ in the word, he laughed for 1 second. Given t strings, find out for how long Toojee laughed on seeing each string.


Input
The first line contains t queries.
This is followed by t lines each containing one string S. String S consists only of capital letters.

Output
Output for each string on a new line.

Constraints
Should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have. Format it like:

1 ≤ t ≤ 10
1 ≤ |S| ≤ 10^6

 

Example
Input:
2
LOL
LOLOL

Output:
1
4
 

Explanation
Test 1: On observation, we can tell that there is only 1 occurrence of LOL.
Test 2: Let the string be 0-indexed and let V = {a, b, c} denote the indices that make up the string “LOL”, where a is index of the 1st ‘L’, b is index of the ‘O’ and c is the index of the 2nd ‘L’.
So, V can be {0, 1, 2}, {2, 3, 4}, {0, 1, 4} and {0, 3, 4}. We see that there are 4 occurrences of the string “LOL”.
