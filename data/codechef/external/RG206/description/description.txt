Points:15Just yesterday, Mr. Krypto made yet another heroic save by disabling an international attempt to hack into and change the stock market databases. But now seeing no imminent threat to the national security, Mr. Krypto is back to his games inside the INSAF. While logging into the website, the employees are supposed to enter their username and password.
