 
Problem description.

Arpit was facing a dillema of whether he could make it the higher divison known as Division 1 of competitive coders in his school . To confirm his spot his Computer Science professor gave him a task :

We define AND operation as it is defined normally where we get a output 1 if both inputs are 1 otherwise the output is 0 . The problem involves two matrices A and B having n rows and m columns where the formation of B matrix is done from A matrix as follows :

B(i , j) = A(i,1) & A(i,2) & ....A(i,m) & A(1,j) & A(2,j) ....& A(n,j)

( More formally each element of B matrix is the AND of all elements in the i row and j column of matrix A )

You will be given B matrix and you have to tell whether its possible to form A matrix or not as "YES" or "NO" As it has been a long time for Arpit not making Division 1 he asks you for help !!
 

Input
The first line consists 'n and m' where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns

Next n lines contains m numbers representing the B matrix 

Output
"YES" or "NO" whether its possible to form matrix A or not !!

Constraints
1<=n , m<=100

Example
Input:
2 3
1 0 1
0 0 0

Output:
YES
