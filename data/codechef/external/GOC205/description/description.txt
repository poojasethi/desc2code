Today is the Annual Sports meet in NIT Hamirpur and all the students have come to see the much awaited 4X400m race. The athletes are lined up in a row from 1 to N, and each one having a chest number, Ai equal to their height. Coach Jamalta is very keen about knowing the order in which the athletes are standing and he has the power to remove anyone he wants from that line. Before the race starts he will give Q commands to the best sportsperson Prakash Chaudhary and Prakash has to obey him. The commands can be either of the following:

1. Replace the ith athlete in the line with a new athlete of height X. This will be represented in the input as a line containing the number 1 followed by the space-separated numbers i and X.

2. Count how many athletes in the range [P, Q] have Ai height <=X. This will be represented in the input as a line containing the number 2 followed by the space-separated numbers P, Q  and X.

Of course, no one can beat Prakash in any sports, but he is not so good in studies and would definitely need your help.

Input
The first line gives the integers N and Q, and the next N lines give the initial values of Ai. Finally the next Q lines each contain a query of the form  1 i X or 2 P Q X.

Output
Print the answer to each 2 query, one per line.

Constraints
1 ≤ Ai ≤ 1,000,000,000

1 ≤ X ≤ 1,000,000,000

1 ≤ N ≤ 1,00,000

1 ≤ P ≤ Q ≤ N


Example
Input:
4 6
3
4
1
7
2 2 4 4
1 4 1
2 2 4 4
2 1 4 5
1 2 10
2 1 3 9


Output:
2
3
4
2

Explanation
There are 4 athletes, whose initial numbers are 3, 4, 1, and 7. Jamalta sir then gave Prakash 6 commands; the first asks him to count the how many of the last three athletes have height at most 4, the second asks him to replace the fourth athlete with the one having height 1 unit, etc.
