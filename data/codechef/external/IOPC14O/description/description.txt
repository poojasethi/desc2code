Consider an infinite geometric sequence S={1, ^1⁄2, ^1⁄4, ^1⁄8 … }.
For given fraction ^p⁄q, check whether one can select an infinite geometric sequence R, such that R ⊆ S and Summation of all elements in R is ^p/q.

Input Format
First line contains an integer T, representing the number of test cases. The next T lines,each contain two space separated integers, p and q.  

Output Format
The output should contain T lines, one for each test case. If there exists such a sequence satisfying the given constraint, print "YES" (without quotes), else print "NO".

Constraints

T ≤ 50000
1 ≤ p,q ≤ 1e9



Sample Input : 
2
3 1
1 3

Sample Output : 
NO
YES

Explanation : 
For 1st test case, there cannot exist any series with sum as 3, since maximum sum possible is 2.
For 2nd test case, the series beginning with ^1⁄4 and geometric factor as ^1⁄4, has sum ^1⁄3
