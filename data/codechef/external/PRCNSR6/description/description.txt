CMan gives you an array A of size N and an integer K. He then defines a function F as follows :F(L, R) = no of pairs (i, j) s.t L ≤ i < j ≤ R and abs(A[i] - A[j]) ≤ K.He gives you Q queries of type L R and asks you to compute the value of F(L, R) for each query.

Input
First line contains three space separated integers N, Q and K
Next line contains N space separated integers denoting the values in array A
Next Q lines each contain two space separated integers L R

Output
For each query output the value of function F

Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ Q ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ K ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ Ai ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ N
