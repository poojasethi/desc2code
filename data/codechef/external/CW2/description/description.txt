Reeti has just started learning how to code. As is the case with many programmers, one begins understanding algorithms with the help of
pseudocode. Reeti has just started looking at some basic algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Binary Search etc. However, being a person with
AOCD (Algorithmic Obsessive Compulsive Disorder), she does not rest until she has rigorously analysed the algorithm she is learning.


Now, she is looking at an algorithm to find the minimum element in an array. This is the pseudocode she is dealing with :
1.   int N;
2.   input N
3.   int arr[1:N];
4.   for i=1...N:
5.       input arr[i]
6.   int min = INFINITY;
7.   for i=1...N:
8.       if(arr[i]<min)
9.           min = arr[i];


Reeti has just completed a course on Probability and Statistics, and being curious she decides to analyse the algorithm from a probabilistic
point of view. She decides to ensure that the array arr is a randomly picked from the set of permutations of numbers 1,N.
Her question is, what is the expected value of the number of reassignments to variable min i.e the number of times line 9 is executed.

Input
 The first line of input is the number of test cases T.
 The next T lines consist of a single integer N, i.e the size of the array for that test case.

Output
 For each test case, print the expected value of the number of reassignments to min, with exactly 3 digits after the decimal point(rounded).
 i.e Even if the answer is a whole number, print it as 5.000 
Example
 Input:

2
1
3


 Output:
1.000
1.833


Explanation
Example case 1. In the first test case, there is only 1 possible array. And we get one reassignment. So expected value is 1/1 = 1.
 In the second test case, there are 6 possible arrays. In sorted order of arrays (descending), number of reassignments are 3,2,2,2,1,1. So expected value = 11/6 = 1.833 (3 decimal places)
