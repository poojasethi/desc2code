 
Problem description.
An array of n integers(0 to 9) is given printing array elements gives an number.You have to find a number that is formed with the elements that are in array which is next higher number than number formed in given order.if there is no such number just print 'NO NXTBIG' without quotes.

Input
Input description.

First line of input contains an integer T denoting number of test cases
First line of each test case contains an integer n denoting number of elements in array
next line contains n space separated integers(0 to 9)



Output
Output description.
For each test case the output contains two lines in which first line contains the number formed by placing the digits in input order and the next line contains the next big number formed from the given digits

Constraints

1 ≤ T,n ≤ 10^5
0 ≤ array element ≤ 9

 

Example
Input:
4
6
7 6 9 3 1 2
5
1 0 7 6 2
11
2 3 5 1 2 3 8 7 5 5 4
5
5 4 3 2 1
Output:
769312
769321
10762
12067
23512387554
23512435578
54321
NO NXTBIG
 

Explaination:


In the given example the output contains first line as the number we get from input 769312 and the next line contains the next big number we get from given digits ie 769321 


In second test case the first number is 10762 and the second line is the next highest number ie 12067


In third test case the first number is 23512387554 and the second line is the next highest number ie 23512435578
