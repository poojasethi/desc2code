You have a rectangular grid of dimension N x M. You need to paint the grid with black or white color such that there is no rectangle of size X x Y having same color in each cell. Find the number of ways to paint the grid, modulo 1000000007.


Input

A single line containing 4 space separated integers, N, M, X and Y. 

Output

A single line containing the answer modulo 1000000007


Constraints

1 ≤ X ≤ 3
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6
2 ≤ Y ≤ M 
If (X = 1), then M ≤ 10^3, no other constraint on N 
If (X = 2), then M ≤ 7, no other constraint on N 
If (X = 3), then N ≤ 8, M ≤ 5


Example
Input:
2 2 1 2

Output:
4
