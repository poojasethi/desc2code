        Array


         


        You are given a 2D array, initially equal to 0. The next input line contains an 
        integer with a Capital character H (Horizontal) or V (Vertical) or S (Square).


         


        You have to read a input line and follow the following criteria:

-     
        

        For every input, you have to start from the last row and first column of the 
        array. Start moving upward until you find an appropriate position to set the 
        input there. If you don’t find a position in that column, then move to next 
        column at the last row, and so on.

-     
        

        If the input line contains 2H, then at the position where you find two 
        horizontal elements containing 0, stop there and place 1 in those elements 
        positions.

-     
        

        If the input line contains 2V, then at the position where you find two vertical 
        elements containing 0, stop there and place 1 in those elements positions.

-     
        

        If the input line contains 2S, then at the position where you find two 
        horizontal and two vertical (a square of two elements) elements containing 0, 
        stop there and place 1 in those elements positions.

-     
        

        If you cannot find a position that fits the given input, simply ignore that 
        input.


         


Input


         


 The first input line contains two 
        integers i.e. the size of the 2D array. The maximum size of the 2D array will be 
        25x25. The next lines contain input to be set in the 2D array. The input will 
        end on the line containing a single 0.
