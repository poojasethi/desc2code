Chef became a problem setter on Codechef.He is creating a problem on sub-sequences.
Statement: You are given an array A of N elements and Q queries.
Each query gives a single integer x for which you have to output the number of strictly increasing sub sequences of length x in the given array.

Before Chef creates its solution,his girlfriend calls him to go for a long drive. As he cannot say no to his girlfriend and he has to submit the problem for Code Marathon contest tomorrow, he ask you to create the solution for the problem.

Input
The first line contains T, the number of testcases.
The first line of each testcase contain two space separated intgers N Q, and the second line contain N space separated integers A1, A2, A3, ......., AN. 
Then the next Q lines follow the queries of type : x.


Output
For each query, output the required answer modulo 1000000007 in a separate line.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ N ≤ 200
1 ≤ Q ≤ N
-10^9 ≤ Ai ≤ 10^9
1 ≤ x ≤ N
