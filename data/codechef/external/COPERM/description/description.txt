Given N and K, count number of permutations of [1, 2, 3 ... N] in which no two adjacent elements differ by more than K.
For example,
permutation [4, 1, 2, 3] cannot be counted for K ∈ {0, 1, 2}.

Input
First line contains T, the number of test cases. Each test case consists of N and K in single line.


Output
For each test case print the required answer in one line.


Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ N ≤ 15
0 ≤ K ≤ N


Example
Input:
2
2 1
3 1

Output:
2
2


Explanation
Example case 1.
All permutations are valid.
Example case 2.
Permutations [1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 1] are counted.
