Problem description:
You are given an array of some distinct numbers . All you have to do is print an resulting 0-indexed
array in which the Prime Numbers are placed at prime positions and composite at composite
positions.But it creates a problem for 0th and 1th index so place “0”(without qoutes) there. And
place “0”(without qoutes) in empty places.

Input:The first line will contain n the size of array and the next line will contain n integers seperated
by space.
Output:Print the resulting array on a single line.
Constarints:
1 <= n <= 10^5
2 <= Ai <= 10^9
Sample test cases:


Input:
6
2 3 7 10 20 25
Output:
0 0 2 3 10 7 20 0 25

Input:
7
8 9 11 600 32 12 14
Ouput:
0 0 11 0 8 0 9 0 600 32 12 0 14
