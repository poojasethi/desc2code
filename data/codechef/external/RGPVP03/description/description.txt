There is a set consist of elements in form of number, the median is an element N such that the number of elements greater than N is equal to the number of elements smaller than N.
For example, in a set {1, 5, 2, 6, 7} the median is 5 because two elements (6 and 7) are greater than 5 and 2 elements (1 and 2) smaller than 5. The set {1, 5, 8, 3} has no median because no element from it satisfies the definition above.


Input
Input will begin with an integer T, the number of test cases.Each Test case starts with an Integer M, the number of elements in set followed by M lines ,each consist of an element of set. 

Output
For each set, output a single line consist of the median of numbers or -1 if numbers has no median
