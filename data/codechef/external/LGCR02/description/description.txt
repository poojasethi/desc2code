 
Write a program that reads an NxN square matrix M that calculates the sum of the elements in individual rows, individual columns and the two main diagonals. Among these sums, print the largest.
Consider the following matrix of order 3x3:
1 10 13
2 14 12
3 9 8
The row sum values are 1+10+13=24, 2+14+12=28 and 3+9+8=20. The column sum values are 1+2+3=6, 10+14+9=33 and 13+12+8=33. The diagonal sums are 1+14+8=23 and 13+14+3=30.
The expected output is maximum among these sums, which is 33.
 

Input
Input description.
Tips:First line contains a value N representing the dimension of the input matrix  M, followed by N lines, each line representing a row of the matrix. Within each row, N values are given and are separated by whitespace.
 

Output
Output description.
Tips:A value which is the maximum among  N row sums, N column sums and the two main diagonal sums in M.
 

Constraints
The entries in M are integers.

1 ≤ N ≤ 100
-100≤ Mij ≤ 100
