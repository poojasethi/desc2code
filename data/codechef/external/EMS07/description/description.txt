On New Year's Eve, in a quiet air traffic monitor's tower, the poor controller realised that he was going to be working at midnight as well. Being a superstitious person, he believes that wishing at least k people at midnight will bring him good luck for the rest of the year. He decides to broadcast a happy new year message to the planes passing by, but wants to broadcast this message only once, and only for the minimum possible radius that will accomodate k planes. Please help this eccentric man.  
All planes travel at uniform speed in a straight line. 

Input

The first
line of the input contains two integers N and K separated by a space character.( 0 < N < 10000 , 0 < K < 10000) )
N is the total number of planes. 
K is the number of planes the controller wants to wish. 
Each of the next N lines contain four integers x1, y1, x2, y2 separated by a space character. ( -2000 < x,y < 2000)
x1 and y1 represent the initial coordinates of a plane (at time zero), while x2 and y2 represent the co-ordinates of the plane after 1 second.


Output

On the first line, output the minimum radius required to reach k planes, accurate to two decimal places.
On one line, output a single integer, which shows the number of seconds after which the message is to be broadcasted. 

Example

Input:
5 3 
0 1 2 3
1 0 0 1
1 2 2 0
1 2 3 2
1 3 4 2

Output:
2.24
