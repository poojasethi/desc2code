Problem Description:
Javascript is a great language its the programming language of the web. This question requires you to learn a new programming language i.e Javascript. The solutions should be submitted in Javascript only. Codechef inputs javascript in node.js format. You don't have to google much about node.js. Just read about Javascript in general and try running your code here.
Internet is nothing but a global connection of devices or interconnected computer networks. Information we send on the web passes through a series of network, this information can be read by the nodes on the network. If we send in plaintext information, a hacker sitting on the network can read our information and use it. That’s why we do things differently! We use something called Cryptography. Its the practice of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties.
Dr. Jojo is a smart guy, he’s using a  MD5 encoding to make his files secure. Our intelligence department have told us to research on Brute Force attack.
Try to not implement everything, we expect you to get the encoding/decoding code from online.
Search smart you have 40 mins of internet access only.

Problem Statement:
Dr. Jojo is targeting world domination, he’s training a bunch of hackers at ei ei ei tee dee. Schools all over India has hired you to decode the message, which they claim contains a very important message.
The hackers are towards the end of their summer vacations and he just passed down this compressed file to them in a group email. Thanks to an inner mole we were able to extract that email.

This is the contents of the email:

The message is 0c049ca2ad590d34d1753419f64eff19

The last hacker we hired almost decoded the message, but we were too late to get it from him. His last words: “The world is 4_letter_word 7_letter_word this email was a 5_leter_word”
Dr. J’s vocabulary is only limited to the wordlist we have attached.

We are in danger. The world will be theirs soon and we are fully aware of that already. I am sure that message contains their next move, we need to decode it and plan accordingly.


Note: You have to submit the javascript code on codechef, the code should show how you have decoded the message (using Bruteforce) and output *only* the decoded message i.e The world is 4_letter_word 7_letter_word this email was a 5_leter_word

Answer template

  //some variables
   var four_letter_words = ;
   var five_letter_words =  ;
   var seven_letter_words = ;

  // a couple of nested loops
        // condition to check if you have cracked
        if (md5(possiblity) == "0c049ca2ad590d34d1753419f64eff19") {
                  console.log(possiblity);
                  break;
        }
        

Notes: No file reading. Copy paste the words from the wordlist. Read about Md5, read about brute force attack and read about loops,variables,conditions in javascript online.
