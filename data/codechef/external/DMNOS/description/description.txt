 
Given a 2xn rectangle/grid, you have to find the number of ways of tiling this rectangle/grid with 2x1 dominoes.
Since the answer could be very large, you need to output it modulo 1000000007 (10^9 +7). 
 

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case consists of a line which contains a positive integer, n.
 

Output
Output on a new line the answer corresponding to (n-1) except for n=1.

Constraints
1<=T<=1000
1<=n <=10^18

Example
Input:
2
