 
The ism to iit team when visited the college for inspection were sort of in a haste because they had already planned not to give it the premier status.
However the leader of the movement Varun Pandey Sir were already ready that such things might be there in their minds. So, to make the inspection procedure really fast and smooth he made a list of all the laboratories of the department.
He had asked some of his juniors to compile this list department wise. But the juniors were really lazy (matiyao types) and thus they inturn distributed the work. Now in the end the final list that Varun Sir has is a lot of strings which consists of department names. Each string represents one laboratory. Refer to example for the output.
