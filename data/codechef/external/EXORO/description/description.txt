You are given an array A1,A2...AN. You have to tell how many pairs (i, j) exist such that 1 ≤ i < j ≤ N and Ai XOR Aj is odd.
Input and Output 
First line T, the number of testcases. Each testcase: first line N, followed by N integers in next line. For each testcase, print the required answer in one line. 
Constraints 
1 ≤ T ≤ 10 
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 
0 ≤ Ai ≤ 10^9
