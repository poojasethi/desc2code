Digo has a Biology exam. The paper has N questions. All the questions have integral marks. Digo has M friends who are sitting around him in a circle. Digoâ€™s friends are numbered from 1 to M, in a clockwise order. Each friend solves exactly one question, not necessarily distinct.
Digo can select any index i (1 <= i <= M) and a number j, and then copies the answers of his j friends starting from index i, (in the clockwise order). If Digo attempts the same question twice, he will get marks only once. Given i and j, your task is to determine what will be the marks scored by Digo.

Input
First line contains N, the number of questions.
Next line contains N space separated integers, where i^th integer denotes the marks of the i^th question.
Each question will contain atmost 100 marks.
Next line contains an integer M, the number of friends of Digo.
Next line contains M space separated integers, where i^th integer denotes the question solved by i^th friend.
The next line contains Q, which is the number of queries asked by Digo.
The next Q lines contain one pair of integers (i, j) each, where i denotes the starting index, and j denotes the number of friends from which he copies the answers.

Output
For every query print a single integer, the marks scored by Digo in that query.

Constraints
1 <= N <= 10000
1 <= M <= 100000
1 <= Q <= 10000
1 <= i, j <= N
