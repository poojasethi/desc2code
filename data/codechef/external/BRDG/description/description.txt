Rescue Operation
N people begin on the same side of a bridge. You must help them across to
the other side. It is night. There is one flashlight. A maximum of two people
can cross at a time. Any party who crosses, either one or two people, must have
the flashlight to see. The flashlight must be walked back and forth, it cannot
be thrown, etc. Each person walks at a different speed. A pair must walk
together at the rate of the slower personâ€™s pace, based on this information,Find the minimum time required for all people to  cross the bridge


INPUT


The first line contains an integer N denoting the number of People.


The next line contains N space separated integers(t1,t2,.........tn )denoting the time required for each person to cross the bridge individually



OUTPUT
Output a single line consisting a single integer denoting the minimum time required for n people to cross the bridge

CONSTRAINTS

2<=N<=10^5
1<=t1,t2.........tN<=10^3 


SUBTASK

EXPLAINATION:

			   Bridge
(5,2,1,10)............................................................................()
		1 & 2 Crossins the bridge (2 unit spent)
(5,10).................................................................................(1,2)
			     1 come back (1 unit spent)
(5,10,1) .............................................................................(2)
		5 & 10 crossing the bridge(10 unit spent)
(1) ....................................................................................(2,5,10)
                     2 come back(2 unit spent)
(1,2)..................................................................................(5,10)
  		1 & 2 Crossins the bridge (2 unit spent)		
().....................................................................................(1,2,5,10)

=> Total time unit spent= 2+1+10+2+2=17
