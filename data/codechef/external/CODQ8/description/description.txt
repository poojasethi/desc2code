Kind of a leg problem !
The diversity rich island of Holumba has a lot of interesting wildlife.
There are creatures with different number of legs.Basically we can categorise them into three different types based on their number of legs :
Gyuubi has 5 legs Sanbi has 3 legs and  Niibi has 2 legs
If total no of legs in one of the zoos is given, you are required to find, all possible combination of number of Gyuubi,Sanbi and Niibi in the zoo.
 

Input

n 
where n is a number depicting total number of legs in the zoo.


Output
 output should be of the following form :

where a is number of Gyuubi b is number of Sanbi and c is the number of Niibi.


Constraints
