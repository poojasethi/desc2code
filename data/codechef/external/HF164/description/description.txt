 
Problem description.
Given center of two circles C1 (x1, y1) and C2 (x2, y2) and radius(r) same for both circles.
Now player P1 and P2 starts running on circle C1(x1, y1) and C2(x2, y2) resp. with same speed and at same time from the topmost point of circle i.e. (x1, y1+r) for circle C1 and (x2, y2+r) for circle C2.
Any player can run in any direction (either clockwise or anticlockwise)
Find minimum distance between P1 and P2 at any time.

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows
Each test case line contains five integers x1 y1 x2 y2 r denoting the center of both circles and then radius.

Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the minimum distance between P1 and P2

Constraints

0 ≤ T ≤ 50000
0 ≤ x1, y1, x2, y2 ≤ 1000000
0 < r < 100000
2*r < abs|(x2-x1)|
Precision :6 digits of decimal
