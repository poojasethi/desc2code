Mech Project

	A Team of Mech guys from UVCE are working on a Robot, which can cut the ripen coconut from the tree by controlling the release of
enzymes in the tree. Team somehow manages to get the Size and ripeFactor of each coconut. If Size of the coconut is
strictly greater than minSize or ripeFactor is strictly greater than minRipeFactor then enzymes will be controlled to
cut that coconut, else it will not be cut.


	The team wants to analyse the efficiency of their Robot. In a tree if the Robot cuts RCut coconuts but actually it was required to
cut ACut coconuts, then efficiency of the Robot will be RCut รท ACut. Write a program to calculate the efficiency of the
Robot.

Input

First line contains T,number of test cases.
In each test case
First line contains 3 space separated integers N (number of coconuts in the tree), minSize and minRipeFactor.
In next N lines i th line contains two space separated integers Size and ripeFactor of i th coconut.
Next line contains single integer ACut.


Output

For each test case print the simplified fraction of RCut/ACut. For clarity refer to the Sample Inputs and Outputs.


Constrains
1 <= T <= 10
1 <= N <= 10^5
0 <= Size, ripeFactor, minSize, minRipeFactor <= 10^9
1 <= ACut <= N

Sample Input

1
5 5 150
1 120
7 133
3 153
5 100
2 150
4

Sample Output

1/2

Explanation
Robot will cut RCut = 2 coconuts, it was actually required to cut ACut = 4 coconuts, so ACut/RCut is 2/4, and simplified ratio is 1/2
