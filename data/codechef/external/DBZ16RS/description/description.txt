Naruto recently learnt a new technique Rasenshuriken. To enhance the power of the new technique, he created N shadow clones of himself. The i^th clone had power Ai. Now Naruto will choose any 2 of the clones. The power of Rasenshuriken thus produced will be the product of the powers of the clones chosen.
But he is going to fight a very strange enemy named Pain. He will be able to defeat Pain if the power of the Rasenshuriken is an even number. Now Naruto wants to know in how many ways he can select 2 of his clones such that he is able to defeat Pain.
Two ways of chosing clones are considered different if there is atleast one clone that is present in first way and absent in the other.

Input

First line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
First line of each test case contains the number of clones N.
N integers follow on the next line denoting the array A.

 

Output

For each test case, output a single line integer on each line: the number of ways Naruto can defeat Pain.

 

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ N, Ai ≤ 10^5

 

Example

Output:
7
 

Explanation
The ways are : {1,2},{1,4},{2,3},{2,4},{2,5},{3,4},{4,5}
