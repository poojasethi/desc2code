A surprisingly unbelievable unrealistic thing happened a day before Valentine’s Day. A lot of girls proposed Shubham and asked him out on a date. As this was the first time any such thing happened to him, he didn’t knew how to say no to any of them and end up saying yes to all. All the girls gave him time for the date on Valentine’s Day. But some of timing of the dates clashed with each other.
Now Shubham is in big problem and cannot decide with whom he should go out with and with whom he should not. Saying no to a girl will break her heart and Shubham do not want to do that, but he also cannot go out with all girls. So he decided to go on dates so that he has to break heart of minimum no. of girls. Help Shubham in finding out the maximum no. of girls that he can go out with.

P.S. - The situation is completely hypothetical and not possible in reality.
 

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of girls who proposed Shubham. The next N line contains two time S and E (starting time and ending time of the date in military time format) separated by a space.

Output
For each test case output a single integer containing the maximum no. of girls that Shubham can go out with on a separate line.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
1 ≤ N ≤ 1000
0 ≤ hour part of S,E ≤ 23
0 ≤ min part of S,E ≤ 59
S < E 


Example
Input:
2
5
0 220
530 715
945 1115
1315 1515
2030 2215
5
1630 1730
1700 1900
1800 2000
1930 2130
2100 2200


Output:
5
3

Explanation
Case 1:  no date timing are clashing with each other, so the answer is 5. 
Case 2: He can go on 1st (1630 to 1730), 3rd (1800 to 2000) and 5th (2100 to 2200) date as they do not clash. So, the answer is 3. 
Note how the time is taken as input: 
0 means 0000
220 means 0220
Do not place preceding zeros.
