 
These days, Sid and Jake are learning about number theory. They have just visited the zoo and during the visit they have counted(yes, they are superb at counting :) ) the number of animals at the zoo. Now, after visiting the zoo, Sid is saying that f is a factor of the total number of animals at the zoo and Jake is saying that m is a multiple of the same.

Now, you have to say whether both are correct or not.
 

Input

The first line of input has a number t, number of test case. Each test case consists of two space separated integers  f  and  m.

 

Output
Output description.
Tips:

Print “CORRECT”(without quotes) if both Sid and Jake are correct, print “WRONG”(without quotes) otherwise.

 

Constraints

1 <= t <= 10^5
1 <= f,m <= 10^18

 

Example
Input:

2
1 4
2 3

Output:

CORRECT
WRONG
