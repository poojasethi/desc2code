Arunava has learnt to find the sum of first N natural numbers using the expression N(N+1)/2.But now Kartik Sir has asked him to find the sum of floor(N/2) for first N natural numbers where floor(X) is the greatest integer less than or equal to a given real number X.Arunava has not memorized any formula for this. So can you help him. 


Input
1st line has an Integer T denoting the number of test cases
Each test Case Contains:
A single integer N on a new line denoting the number of natural number upto which it needs to be summed.



Output
For each test case output a single line containing required sum as the output



Example

Input:
5
1
2
3
4
5


Output:
0
1
2
4
6



CONSTRAINTS:
1 ≤ T  ≤ 100000
1 ≤ N ≤ 10000
0 ≤ S ≤ 214783647


Explanation of the fifth test case N=5,
The required sum is floor(1/2)+ floor(2/2)+ floor(3/2)+ floor(4/2)+ floor(5/2)=0+1+1+2+2=6
