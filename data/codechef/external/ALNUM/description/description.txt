 
Rahul and Jupiter are playing a new game called Alien Numbers. They defined L as the length of a given number when the number is in base 10(decimal). Now they are finding new methods to determine numbers which are Alien in a given range.
A number N with L ≥ 1 is considered to be alien iff:

 N is divisible by L,

 N/L is alien recursively,

Since this task contains very large range of numbers and Jupiter needs to return to his planet, therefore they need your help in finding how many numbers are there in a interval X and Y (both inclusive).
 

Input
First line of input contains T, the number of testcases.
Next T lines contains two integers X and Y defining the range.
 

Output
For each case output a single integer denoting the number of Alien Numbers between X and Y.
 

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 200
0 ≤ X ≤ 10^18
0 ≤ Y ≤ 10^18

 

Example
Input:
2
7 25
45 50

Output:
10
1
 

Explanation
Example case 2 : Only 48 satisfies the given properties.
