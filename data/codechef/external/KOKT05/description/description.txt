Problem Statement

	Chef has bought T strings to gift his friend Jay. Later he realized that Jay only likes those strings which are wonderful. A string is wonderful only if all the characters in that string are repeated the same number of times. Chef can change any letter of the string to any other letter, but it costs one coin for him to do so. Now he wants to know the minimum number of coins required to make each string wonderful.


Input

	The first line of input contains an integer T.
T lines follow. Each containing a string S composed of only lower-case letters.


Output

	For each string, print minimum number of coins required in a new line.


Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 1500
1 ≤ |S| ≤ 2000

2



Explanation

Case 3:
One possible solution is codecdeo. 'h' is changed to 'd' and 'f' is changed to 'o', which makes the string wonderful. Number of coins required = 2.
Case 2:
Each of the characters ('j' , 'a' and 'y') are repeated exactly once. So it is already a wonderful string. NO coins are required.
Case 1:
Optimal way is to change 'h' to 'v' or 'v' to 'h'.
Number of coins required =  1.
