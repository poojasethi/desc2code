He has selected some points(i.e, integeral coordinates) on the cake and will make a complete horizontal and vertical cuts on the cake for each point, dividing cake in four parts.

For Example, Consider a cake of size width=4, height=3 and a point (2,2)

Gaurav a foodie friend of Mr IYER, somehow managed to get the points and the size of cake, now he is trying to find out, what can be the largest and smallest part(i.e area) of the cake, which he can get?
As Gaurav is busy in buying gift for Mr IYER, he needs your help.

Input

First line of input contains the integer T denoting the number of test cases, description of T test cases follows.
First line of each test case contains two integers N,M denoting the size of rectangular cake(i.e width and height).
Next line of each test contains an integer Q denoting the number of points.
Next Q lines of each test case contains two integers Ai,Bi denoting the points on the cake.


Output

For Each Test Case on a Single line, Output the Smallest and Maximum size of cake after making cuts.


Constraints
