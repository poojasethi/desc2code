 
In a morning assembly line in Hogwarts, N students of house Slytherin stood in an unordered line in a random manner (in terms of their heights)  with each student having unique positive height.
There is a boy named "Longbottom" who is very mischievious. Professor McGonagall assigned Harry a task to keep an eye on "Longbottom". All students were then arranged in the increasing order of their heights, with the shortest ones first and longest ones at the last.
For example, if the heigths of the students in unordered assembly line was {1, 3, 5, 2, 4} after arranging them in increasing order, it becomes {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. 
Before arranging students, "Longbottom" was on K^th position (indexing starts from 1) in the unordered assembly line. Harry lost his view on "Longbottom", while students were being arranged. Your job is to tell Harry, what is the position of "Longbottom" in the ordered assembly line.
 

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains one integer N denoting the number of students in the assembly line of house Slytherin.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the heights of students standing in the unordered assembly line of Slytherin.
The third line contains the only integer K, indicating the position of "Longbottom" in the initial unordered assembly line.
 

Output
For each test case, output a single line containing an integer, denoting the position of "Longbottom" in the final assembly line.
 

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 100

Explanation
In the example test there are T = 3 test cases.
Test case 1.
In the first test case N equals to 4, K equals to 2, A equals to {1, 3, 4, 2}. The answer is 3, because {1, 3, 4, 2} ->(after arranging according to height of students) {1, 2, 3, 4}. A2 now is on the 3^rd position.
Test case 2.
In the second test case N equals to 5, K equals to 5, A equals to {1, 2, 3, 9, 4}. The answer is 4, because {1, 2, 3, 9, 4} ->(after arranging according to height of students) {1, 2, 3, 4, 9}. A5 now is on the 4^th position. 
Test case 2.
In the third test case N equals to 5, K equals to 1, A equals to {1, 2, 3, 9, 4}. The answer is 1, because {1, 2, 3, 9, 4} ->(after arranging according to height of students) {1, 2, 3, 4, 9}. A1 now is on the 1^st position.
