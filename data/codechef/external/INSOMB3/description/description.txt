Given a matrix of dimensions RxC composed of only two types of characters: 
'*' and '#' 
 find the number of I characters present in the matrix. The
criteria for identifying an I is as follows:



All the characters forming the I are # only.


The figure is completely filled with #s.


The thickness and width of the top and bottom rectangles is identical.


The central column is formed by leaving out floor(width/3) positions on both
sides.


The central column may be of any length â‰¥ 1


The I must be surrounded by "*" or the border (i.e. no additional attachments to the I)



Note: A given input figure is likely to contain multiple I's.


Input Format:

Line 1: R C - Two space separated natural numbers denoting the dimensions of
the rows and columns in the matrix respectively. Both R and C will be less than or equal to 40.

Line 2 to R+1: Lines containing C space separated symbols. The symbols are
chosen from the set {*, #}


Output Format:

Line 1: The number of I's in the given figure. 


Sample Input:

10 10
# # # # # # # # # #
# # # # # # # # # #
* * * # # # # * * *
* * * # # # # * * *

# # # # # # # # # #
# # # # # # # # # #


Sample Output:

0


Explanation: The given I is invalid because of 2 reasons:

It is not completely filled

It has an extra attachment of a # on the right side of the central column.
