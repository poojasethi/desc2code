The mood’s good, the food is coming, the glasses are overflowing, its all so perfect, as if nothing

installed yet another one time programmable security keypad outside the parking entrance, complete 

with another one of his twisted algorithms of course. While people are trying hard to decrypt his 

code, Mr. Krypto is having the most fun in the party all the while singing “la la la...You’ll go round 

fixing this one...da da da”. You know what to do.
