Alice is bright student. She is preparing for IIT JEE. When she practices mathematics she come across many problems which require use of various algebric function especially finding divisors.
So she decided to automate this process by writing a program which will solve this particular problem.  For two integers A and B, she needs to find number of positive integers N such that N*B has at least one devisior D that lies in N < D <=A.


Input
The first line contains a single positive integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The only line of each test case contains two positive integers A and B.

Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the answer for the corresponding test case.

Constraints

A<=1000;
B<50
