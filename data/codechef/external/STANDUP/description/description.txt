A classroom at the Academy of Bit Wizardry contains N rows of chairs. Each row, contains exactly M chairs. Each chair is expected to be filled by exactly one student; you may assume no chair is ever empty.
Curiously, N*M is guaranteed to be an even number. This means there are always an even number of students in a class. The students come to the Academy of Bit Wizardry from (N*M / 2) coutries. In fact, exactly 2 students come from each country.
You enter the classroom and find all the students sitting. This displeases you and you request them to stand up. They tell you that they are going to play a game with you. You will play the game move by move. In each move you first make 1 student stand up and declare his country name. Then, you make another student stand up and declare his country name. If both the students belong to the same country, they both remain standing. Otherwise, they will now both sit down. Of course, you may ask the same student to stand up again in a later move.
You grin as you know you have an amazing memory. Although you don't know initially which student belongs to what country, you are sure that once a student declares it, you will remember it indefinitely. You will never have to make a student stand up more than twice. Soon, you will have the entire class standing.
There is no way for you to know what country a student belongs to initially. You could choose a fixed strategy that does not optimize itself based on the responses the students are giving and easily have the class standing in exactly N*M moves. But you are smarter; hence, you will dynamically optimize your strategy based on their responses.
Assuming that the students choose their chairs uniformally randomly over all possible seatings, what is the expected number of moves that such a dynamically optimized optimal strategy would take to make every student stand up?

Input
There are at most 100 test cases in each test file. Each test case contains a single line with two positive integer N and M. The input is terminated by EOF.

Output
For every test case, output a single line with the expected number of moves you will take to make every student stand up if you employ an optimal strategy. Print this number rounded to 4 decimal places.

Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 50
1 ≤ M ≤ 50


Sample Input

1 2
2 2


Sample Output

1.0000
2.6667


Explanation
In the first test case, there are only 2 students. Of course they are from the same country. Hence, only 1 move is needed.
In the second test case, we wil leither take 2 moves, or three moves at most.
In the first move, the probability that we choose a pair of students from the same country, is 1/3. In this case, the game ends in 2 moves.
Otherwise, with probability 2/3, we have selected two students from different countries. Now, we will only take 2 more moves. For the third student we ask to stand up, after the first 2 sit, we already know who his pair is from the first move. And the remaining two will be asked to stand up in the third move.
Hence, the expected number of moves is 2 * (1/3) + 3 * (2 / 3) = 2.6667
