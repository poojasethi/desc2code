Problem description.
Bots  is an artificial intelligence programming competition where participants strive
to program games that shall defeat their opponentâ€™s game.  Now you need to play a move to worsen the position of the opponent. You have calculated the value of the N possible moves of the opponent.  You have to calculate the maximum number of moves that has the cumulative value  less than K.

Input
There is a single positive integer T on the first line of input. It stands for the number of cases to follow.  Each case consists of a number N, the number of total values of move calculated. Next line takes the N integers representing possible values of the moves calculated. Next line consist of Q, numbers of queries. Next line consists of Q integers where each integer represent value of K for a query.

Output
Output consists of T lines, each line has Q integers with a space in between, representing number of moves for each query

Constraints
1<=T<=10
1<=N<=100000
1<=Q<=100
1<=K<=10^18
