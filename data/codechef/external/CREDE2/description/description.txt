Congratulations!!! You have been selected as a contestant on the show, Programmer's Jackpot tonight. For one of the rounds in the show, you face a problem as defined below :
 
"For any positive integer 'X' , the sum of digits called as digit-sum of 'X', is defined as the sum of 'X' itself and its digits. When 'Y' is the digitsum of 'X' , we call 'X' a encore of 'Y'.
For example, the digit-sum of 245 is 256 (= 245 + 2 + 4 + 5). Therefore, 245 is a encore of
256.
But there are some numbers which do not have any encores, and some numbers have more than one encore.
For example, the encores of 216 are 198 and 207."

Your task for this round is to write a program to find the smallest encore of the given integer.


Input

Your first line of input consists of 'K' (1 ≤ K ≤ 50) test cases. The number of test cases 'K' is given in the first line of the input followed by a blank line. Each test case takes one line containing an integer N , (20 ≤ N ≤ 100,000).


Output

The output of your program will print exactly one line for each test case. The line is to contain a
encore of N for each test case. If X has multiple encores, print the smallest. If X does not have any
encores, print "NONE".
The following shows sample input and output for three test cases.


Sample Input:
3

216
121
2005

Sample Output:
198
NONE
