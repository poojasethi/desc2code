There is a special device which represents numbers using asterisk. For example, 10 vertical asterisk represent the number ten. A sequence of numbers can be represented by a sequence of vertical lines of asterisk.

For example,
  *
  *
 **
 **
***
*** ***
*** *** 
**********


Represents the sequence: 4, 6, 8, 1, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1.

Write a program to input a list of 10 integers and output a graph of the numbers using just space characters and star characters (*).


Input
The first 10 lines of input contains 10 non-negative integers (all less than 20 and one input in one line).Let us use V[i] to refer the ith number in the list.


Output
If M is the largest value in the input, then the output is a series of M lines, where each column has V[i] stars (asterisks) in it, starting from the bottom row. Trailing spaces on a line are ignored.


Example

Input:
10
9
7
8
6
5
3
4
2
1



Output:
*         
**        
***      
****      
*****     
******    
*******  
********  
********* 
**********
