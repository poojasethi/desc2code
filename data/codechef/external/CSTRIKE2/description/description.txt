 Ace has a team consisting of N players. He calls a subset of this team to be good if the subset has
two or more players. He denotes all the good teams as S1 , S2 , S3 , ... , S2^N -N-1. Now he
represents the GCD of the players of each good team Si as Gi. 
As you know Ace does not like to loose matches in COUNTER STRIKE and he can only win with
the team having maximum Gi.
Help Ace to find the maximum Gi .

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The
description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of players in
the team. The second line contains N space-separated integersA1, A2, ..., AN denoting the
players of the team.

Output
For each test case, output the single line containing maximum Gi

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10
2 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ Ai ≤ 2*10^6
sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 8*10^5


Example
Input:
2
5
1 2 3 4 5
6
2 9 99 12 36 48
Output:
2
12

Explanation
Example case 1. Maximum gcd is 2 for the subset {2, 4}
Example case 2. Maximum gcd is 12 for the subset {12, 36, 48}
