You have an array A of size N containing only positive numbers. You have to output the maximum possible value of A[i]%A[j] where 1<=i,j<=N. 

Input
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the size of the array. The next N lines contains integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the numbers
 

Output
Output a single integer answering what is asked in the problem.
 

Example
Input:
2
1
2

Output:
1
 

Explanation
There will be four values, A[0]%A[0] = 0, A[0]%A[1]=1, A[1]%A[0]=0, A[1]%A[1]=0, and hence the output will be the maximum among them all, that is 1.
