Problem Statement
Bruce being very fond of Rachel, asks her out for 28th Feb, National Science Day. (Yeah! What a nerd :p)
Not sure of her plan for the weekend, she asks him to do something extra-ordinary to prove his love.
Rachel says "Bruce, today I want the Batman to be the Spiderman!".

Now given a vertical wall of NxM blocks, each block having some difficulty level. Batman has to climb the wall up from (0,0) to any block in the topmost layer.
Not being as efficient as Spiderman, Bruce tries the greedy way out, from each block he can go up in any of the 3 available blocks (For any block the maximum possible blocks can be 3, diagonally left, just above and diagonally right), so he will always choose the block with the least difficulty. In case of two blocks with same difficulty, he always chooses the Leftmost one.


Batman can face a max difficulty of K units. Now your task is tell whether Bruce will get a date with Rachel or not.


Input


First line T, the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of:

First line N M K, the dimensions of wall W and the Maximum difficulty Bruce can bear.
Then a NxM matrix showing the difficulty levels of all the blocks. N lines each with M entries.

There will be a blank line after each test case


Output
  For each test case print in a new line, "Yes" if he can climb the wall with given K tolerance.
  print "No" otherwise.


Constraints


 1 <= T <= 100
  
1 <= N, M <= 100
  
1 <= K  <= 10^18
  
0 <= W[i][j] <=10^9



Example
Input:
2
4 3 9
2 2 1
2 3 2
3 1 5
3 2 1

4 3 7
2 2 1
2 3 2
3 1 1
3 2 1

Output:
Yes
No


Explanation
Example case 1. from (0,0) difficulty=3, he will climb to (1,1) then to (2,0) then (3,0) incurring a total of 3+1+2+2=8 <9 so he will be able to impress her. :)


Case 2:
But in the second case, it exceeds his limit. Note that He has to start frm the lower-leftmost block only.
