 
Chef Praveen likes acronyms a lot. He always uses them (his chat message vocabulary consists of LOL, BRB, ROFL etc.). So, he has decided that he wants to count the number of words that are acronyms in a chat message. However he is too lazy to code this simple program, so he tells you "Hey, write this program ASAP, I will BRB". 

Formally a word is a acronym if:

It has more than 1 character
All its characters are upper case


Some examples of acronyms are: ICPC, LOL etc. 
Some examples of words which are not acronyms are: The, A, hi etc.
 

Input
The input consists of a single line: the chat message for which you have to count the acronyms.

Output
Output a single number: the number of words in the input that are acronyms.
 

Constraints

There is only a single line
The line will only contain alphabets (a to z, A to Z) and spaces to separate the words.
The total number of characters in a line will be atleast 1 and atmost 1000.

 

Example
Input:
I like coding and will participate in IOI Then there is ICPC

Output:
2

 

Explanation
Example case 1. The words IOI and ICPC are acronyms, rest are not.
