No nodes of the tree can be visited twice.
Stone can be moved only along the edges between the nodes.
Only one stone can be used for one traversing.


Help KOOL and KOOLER.


Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then, T lines follow. Each line contains an integer H( Height of the tree).
