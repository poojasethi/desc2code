 
Sagar is the head of the technical team of RIPE, the Intelligence agency of Codepur.
Recently, the RIPE was able to crack down the emails exchanged between the terrorists. The
emails contain the coordinates of the points where the attacks are going to be carried out.
However, they contain the coordinates in an encrypted form. The coordinates are in binary
form obtained by shifting it right K-1 times and xoring the numbers obtained.
For example :
If the 5 (N = 5) digit actual binary coordinate is 10101, then it is XORed with K-1 (4-1=3)
numbers which are formed by positioning the numbers to the right side, simultaneously.
Then the coordinate is :

								         1 0 1 0 1
								            1 0 1 0 1
									       1 0 1 0 1
									          1 0 1 0 1
On xoring each column here, we get               1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1

The encrypted form of the coordinate 10101 is
11000011.
Now Sagar wants your help to formulate an algorithm to find out the decrypted coordinates
from the encrypted binary codes.

 

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
First line of each test case contains two space separated integers, N and K.
Next line contains a string(containing only 0s and 1s), the encrypted code.

 

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing the decrypted code.

 

Constraints
Should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have. Format it like:

1 ≤ T ≤ 50
1 ≤ N ≤ 1000000
2 ≤ K ≤ 1000000

 

Example
Input:
1
5 4
11000011

Output:
10101
