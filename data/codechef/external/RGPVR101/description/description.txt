A string has been given and you have to generate a string code. The code is generated in the following manner:-  the left half of each code is being generated starting in the middle of the string and proceeding out toward the left. Similarly, the right half of each code is being generated starting at the right  and proceeding in toward the middle of the string. For example, the string 
   ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

is being coded as 

   MLKJIHGFEDCBAZYXWVUTSRQPON



Input

String contains between 2 and 50 characters, inclusive. 
String contains an even number of characters. 
String contains only uppercase letters ('A'-'Z') . 
1 ≤ T ≤ 20 


Output
For every String, output a single line containing String code.
