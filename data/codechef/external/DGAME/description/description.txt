Problem Statement
Two Friends Single and Double want to date the same girl named Triple, but as both are friends they decide that they will play a game to decide who will go on a date with Triple.
 In this game there will be n piles of coins, both players will take turns and pick at least one coin from one particular pile only, Double starts the game first. A player loses when he cannot further remove coins from any pile. Double wants to date this girl so badly that he asks for your help because you are one of the best friends of Double. Help Double to find minimum number of coins he needs to take out from a particular pile initially such that he wins. Assume both play optimally. If he cannot win in anyway then tell him so.

Input

First line of the input will contain t, the number of test cases.
Next 2*t lines follow, First line of each test case will contain an integer n, the number of piles of coins in the game.

Second line will contain n space separated integers.


Output
There will t lines printing the output. Each line will print output "NO" if Double cannot win the game by any move. If Double can win the game by any move then print "YES j l", where "j" is the pile number from which Double has to pick up "l" number of coins.

Tips:

If you have multiple test cases in a file start this section as: "For each test case, output a single line containing...".
