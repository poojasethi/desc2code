 
An intergalactic tournament has been scheduled on Earth. So dexter have got an assignment to prepare landing sites for the guest’s spaceships. He have prepared n landing sites and the cost for landing on ith landing ai (1<=i<=n). As expected each guest will land on the site with minimum cost. But if guest spaceships arrives and there is no landing site available the they will go back, which is not good. So Dexter will have to pay a fine of f rupees. The number of guests visiting the tournament will be m.
Your task is to calculate the total profit that Dexter will get in this tournament.
No two spaceship can land on same site. You can assume that all guest come at the same time and all the landing site is available before any guest come.
 

Input
First line contains t, the number of test cases. For each test case , first line contain n, number of landing sites and f, the fine. Second line contain integer n integers price of landing sites.Third line contain m, number of Spaceships.
 

Output
t lines containing solution to the respective test case..
 

Constraints

1 ≤ t ≤ 10
1 ≤ n ≤ 1000
1 ≤ f,m,ai ≤ 10000000(10^7)
