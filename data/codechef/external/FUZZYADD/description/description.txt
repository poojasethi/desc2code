Brady has recently learned addition. However, he only knows numbers with at most 6 digits! Specifically, he only knows the integers 0 to 999999.

This presents an issue when he adds two numbers: sometimes the sum has more than 6 digits. In these cases, he has a simple "solution": whenever he adds two integers whose sum exceeds 999999, he simply uniformly chooses a random integer from 0 to 999999 as the "sum" of those integers.
Now, there is a sequence of integers V1, ..., VN, and Brady wants to add them one by one, starting from 0. In other words, he starts with S0 = 0, and sets Si = Si-1 + Vi (using his "addition" method) for 1 ≤ i ≤ N. For every i, what is the expected value of Si?

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer N denoting the number of integers to add.
The next N lines contain the integers, where the i^th line contains Vi.

Output
Output N lines, where the i^th line contains the expected value of Si. Be careful about precision! Your answer will be considered correct if it is within an absolute or relative error of 10^-6 from the true answer.

Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ Vi < 10^6

Explanation
#1-#3. The first three additions don't exceed 999999, so they will be performed correctly.
#4. At this point, the cumulative total is 999999, and the number to be added is 1. Since this exceeds 999999, Brady just chooses a random number from 0 to 999999. The expected value is the average of all such numbers, or 499999.5
#5. At this point, the cumulative total can now have any value from 0 to 999999 with equal probability, and the number to be added is 100. If the total is less than 999900, then the addition will be performed correctly. Otherwise, the answer exceeds 999999 and a random number from 0 to 999999 is selected. The expected value among all possibilities is 500049.495.
