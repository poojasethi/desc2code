In numeral systems, the radix or base is the number of unique digits, including zero, that a numeral system uses to represent numbers.
For example, for the decimal system (the most common system in use today) the radix is ten, because it uses the ten digits from 0 through 9. And hence, in such a number system 9 is followed by 10 , 11 and so on.
Your task is to rite a program that converts a number from a radix 10 system to other system with a different radix.


Input

The first line will contain a single positive integer T denoting the number of lines following it. After the first line , T lines follow each containing two numbers N (0 ≤ N ≤ 1000). and D (2 ≤ D ≤ 9).Here D denotes the radix or base in which N is supposed to be converted.


Output

A set of T lines should be printed , each lines containing one number which is the converted form of N in the base D
