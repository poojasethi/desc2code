Junior_chef is very fond of cakes. But as they aren't good for his health, chef doesn't wants him to access the cakes easily. So he has devised a game for him. Chef has rectangular pieces of cakes and the length of each cake is L cm. The cake can only be cut at certain points. Junior_chef is needed to calculate the number of 'good' pieces. A 'good' piece is the one which, after cutting the cake at two distinct positions has a length greater than k cm.

Input 
 The first line of the input contains the number of test cases t (1<=t<=200). Each of the next t lines consists of two lines. The first line consists of three integers : L, length of the cake (3<=L<=5*10^4), N, total number of points where the cake can be cut (2<=N<=MIN(L-1,10^4)) and K (0<=K<=L-1). The second line of each test case contains N distinct integer array A, where each integer denotes the point where the cake can be cut(in cm) 1<=A[i]<=L-1.

Output
Print the answer in single line.

Sample Input
2
10 2 6
1 3
10 3 5
1 3 9

Sample Output
1
3

Explanation
For the 1st test case, if the cake is cut at 1cm and 3cm, three pieces will be generated of length 1cm,2cm,7cm.As the length of the third piece is greater than 6, it's a 'good' piece.
For the 2nd test case,all three possible pairs will be 'good' pieces
