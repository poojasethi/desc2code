Junior_chef  and his classmates love a girl named Alice and want her to sit with them. But Alice, being a lover of Mathematics will only sit with the boy who can calculate the correct impressions of a problem. The problem goes like this - each student is given an identical string of length L.
The impressions of a string is the number of such sub-sequences (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsequence) of a string which have an odd length n(n â‰¥ 3) and possess the unique property, the middle most character of the string is 'o' and all other characters are 'l'.So if length n=5,the string "lloll" has an impression 1.

Input 
 :
 The first line of the input contains the number of test cases t (1<=t<=10). Each test case consists two inputs: The string S having length L(1<=L<=100000) and the length of the string 'n' to be searched in S,(1<=n<=S-1),n is odd.
Output :Print the impressions of the string modulo  10^9+7(1000000007),as the output might overflow.
.

Sample Input
2
lol 3
ollollo 5

Sample Output
1
1

Explanation
In the first test case, the string 'lol' satisfies the condition so it has a impression 1. 
In the second test case the only string that satisfies the condition is 'lloll' so it has a impression 1. 
P.S. : Both the test cases are having Continuous good strings.
