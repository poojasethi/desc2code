EDIT :  Please note that the user enters the whole string "Energy Level: 217" instead of just 217. You'd have to input accordingly. The output should only be the ids of radioactive elements, one id per line. Stick to the input/output format.

Problem description:
After the nuclear war the world is now radioactive. Scientists say if we are not able to track the radioactive element within 30 mins, the human life as we know it, will be extinct. From element survey machines all over the world, we have collected some data. The data contains the energy levels of elements though multiple surveys. The elements with energy level more than 200 might be radioactive. The data is overwhelming, it has so many files that it cannot be read through by any human in so less amount of time. NASA has hired you to find the element. 

Input
The first line contains an integer N - denoting the number of elements. The description of these elements follows in the next N lines.

Output
Output the IDs of the elements that might be radioactive.

Constraints
Should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have. Format it like:

1 ≤ N ≤ 100
1 ≤ Energy Level ≤ 1000

 

Example1
Input:

3
Energy Level: 20
Energy Level: 200
Energy Level: 201

Output:
3

Example2
Input:

4
Energy Level: 217
Energy Level: 246
Energy Level: 4
Energy Level: 349

Output:
1
2
4
 

Explanation
Example 1: The first and second element are at energy levels 20, 200 respectively i.e not radioactive. While the third one is at energy level 201, which is radioactive.
Example 2: The first, second and fourth exceed energy level of 200.
