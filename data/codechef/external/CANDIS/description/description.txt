 Nehal is a kindergarten teacher. She has a lot of candies and wants to give some of them to her students. All the N students sit in a line, and each of them must be given at least one candy. She wants to distribute the candies in such a way that the product of the number of candies any two adjacent kids have, is not greater than M. 
 You will be given N and M, you have to find the number of ways Nehal can distribute the candies. Since this number can be very large, output your answer modulo 1000000007.

Input Description
First line contains N and the next line contains M 

Output Description
Output the number of candy sequences possible modulo 1000000007.
