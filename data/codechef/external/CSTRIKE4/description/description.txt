As you know in COUNTER STRIKE each player can belong to either Terrorist or Counter Terroritst. Let T denotes player belong to Terrorist and C denotes player belongs to Counter Terrorist.
You are given a String S of length N-1, and it consists only of the letters C and T. You need to rearrange the numbers from 1 to N(including 1 and N) and save it an array X such that
 if S[i] = T  -->  X[i] > X[i+1]
  
if S[i ] = C  --> X[i] < X[i+1]
As there can be many such permutations, you need to print the
lexicographically
 largest permutation. 

Input
The only line of input contains a String S

Output
The output contains N space separated integers(i.e. permutation of N numbers as described above).

Constraints
1 ≤ length of String ≤ 10^5
 

Example
Input:
CCCCCT

Output:
2 3 4 5 6 7 1 
 

Explanation
Example case 1. The lexicographically largest permutation that satisfies the given condition is:
2 3 4 5 6 7 1
