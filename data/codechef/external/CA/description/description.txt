Smugglers are becoming very smart day by day. They use SMS to communicate with each other. Police can often intercept their messages and bust them. Now they have developed a new technique of sending their messages from one smuggler to another.
In their new technology, they are sending their messages in a number format. This format represents the way that numbers and characters are padded on mobile’s keypad. 
One smuggler sends a text message to the second smuggler, using the numbers corresponding to the letters on the keypad. When the receiving smuggler gets the message, he simply opens the “create text message” function in his mobile and types the number string. This way the receiver finally reads the original message.

For Example:
6999066263304447777077766622337778 -----> message sent by the first smuggler.
my name is robert---------> message decoded by the second smuggler.
Where ‘0’ denotes the "space".
But for word monkey
6#666#665533999 this string will be sent by the smuggler one
Here ‘# ‘ denotes that if smuggler watches ‘#’ then it means character previous to # is on the same key to the character after the ‘#’ and smuggler has to wait for 2 seconds and then press the same key. 
 You have to make a program  that takes as input a numerically coded string as message and outputs decoded message.

Constraints

Smuggler can never send numbers in message text
Output will always be in uppercase

Input
First line T, will have a single integer having number of test cases followed by T lines of input each having CODED message send by smuggler 1.

Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the message smuggler 2 will get after decoding.

Example

Input:
2
6999066263304447777077766622337778
6#666#665533999 

Output:
MY NAME IS ROBERT
