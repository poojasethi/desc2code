Â Jayapradha and Jayasruthi are twin sisters. They love adventures and went to kids island as part of their adventure. Every city in that kids island is described by the one-dimensional co-ordinate system. They planned to go to the city located at 0th co-ordinate. Unfortunately, Jayapradha lost her way to reach the city and got trapped at some city located at the nth co-ordinate. But Jayasruthi reached the city at 0th co-ordinate safely. To reach her sister, Jayapradha moves towards 0th co-ordinate through a series of steps. At each step, she could only move to a length of "any prime factor of n". The factor chosen need not be same in each step(i.e it could be any of the prime factor of n). Your task is to help Jayapradha to reach her sister Jayasruthi in minimum number of steps.

 NOTE: 1 IS NOT PRIME.
