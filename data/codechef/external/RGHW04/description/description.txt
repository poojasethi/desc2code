Recently Kate learned about co-prime numbers. So for her practice Jamie used to give her an integer everyday and asked Kate to find an integer which is the non-even smallest integer greater than the given integer such that both of the numbers are co-prime. Kate got well in finding the next cop-prime number, but being her friend you decided to ask her to teach you as well. So now she gave you one number each day as well.  

Input
Each test case contain a single integral value
 

Output
For each integer find the next non-even smallest integer which is larger than the given integer and the both the numbers are co-prime and output in new line.
 

Constraints
number of test cases<=100|integral value| <= 1*10^5

Sample Input
2210

Sample Output:
 311
