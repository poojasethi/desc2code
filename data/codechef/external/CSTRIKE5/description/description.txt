Finally Shinchan and Ace won all the matches of COUNTER STRIKE but they have forgotten to do their homework. Help them to finish their homework as it is already too late.
You are given a weighted tree with W nodes. Nodes are numbered from 1 to W.
For each node, you need to print the sum of distance of the nodes to all other nodes.
Mathematically, for each node w, print the value of the expression Distance from node w to 1st node + Distance from node w to 2nd node +..... + Distance from node w to Wth node

Input Format
The first line contains T, the number of test cases. 
For each test case, there are multiple lines. The first line contains W, the number of nodes in the tree. The next Wâˆ’1 lines describe the tree; each line contains 3 integers X, Y, and Z, which denote that there is an edge from X to Y with weight Z.


Constraints

Sum of W over all test cases <=200000
1<= W <=100000
1<= X,Y <=W 
1 <= Z <= 1000000


Output Format
For each test case, output exactly W lines.
The i^th line should contain the answer for the i^th node.

Sample Output

382434241519152520101016

Explanation
For the first test caseFor Node 1: Distance from 2 (13) + distance from 3 (18) + distance from 4 (7) = 38 
For Node 2: Distance from 1 (13) + distance from 3 (5) + distance from 4 (6) = 24 
For Node 3: Distance from 1 (18) + distance from 2 (5) + distance from 4 (11) = 34 
For Node 4: Distance from 1 (7) + distance from 2 (6) + distance from 3 (11) = 24
