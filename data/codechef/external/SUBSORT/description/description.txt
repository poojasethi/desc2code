 
Problem description.
Griet Coders gave ranking to the best programmers present in their campus but some people are not present for the prize distribution day and the people who are present are n in count are listed rankwise in the increasing order of their rank but unfortunately the list was printed wrongly and some of the people are printed mistakenly in different places so that one of the sublist is unsorted now the event manager wants to sort the list so that he would get the correct list,the time is very less and he should do it in minimum time so please help the event manager in identifying the unsorted sublist
Major problem:The Major problem is given array A[] of size n and the user should identify the starting and ending indices of the sublist which is unsorted in the given arraynote:the indexing of the array should start at 1
Note:Assume that every array is unsorted somewhere

Input
Input description.

First line of input contains an integer T denoting number of test cases
First line of each test case contains an integer n denoting number of elements in array
next line contains n space separated integers of array



Output
Output description.
For the test case output i,j where i  and j are the start index and ending index of unsorted sublist respectively

Constraints

1 ≤ T,n ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ array element ≤ 10^9

 

Example
Input:
2
6
1 2 4 3 5 6
7
10 12 11 14 13 15 16
Output:
3,4
2,5
 

Explaination:


In the given example the first array is partially sorted in which the sub array 4,3 is unsorted so the output is the first and end index of unsorted array that is 3,4


 In the second test case it is 2,5 which are the start and end indeces of the unsorted subarray 12,11,14,13
