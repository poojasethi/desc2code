Problem Description
There are N students in a class.The lazy teacher randomly gives a number(Lets call this the 'Class Random Number' CRN)to each of the students.
To keep them busy for a long time she gives the following work.
For each student,
1.Calculate the sum of all the other students' Class Random Number(excluding yours).
2.Once every student is done with step 1, set the sum obtained from step 1 as your new 'Class Random Number'.
3.Repeat step 1.

 The teacher instructs the students to repeat the process 'T' number of times, hoping that it would take a very long time. Much to her suprise, one of the students claims that
he has completed the calculation and that he knows the 'Class Random Number' of all the students after 'T' iterations.The teacher thus asks the CRN of Q students.You, being
that class student are going to write a program to complete the given task.Since the numbers can be very large, output the answer mod 1000000007 (10e9 + 7)


Input
The first line of input contains the number of students N.
The next line of input contains N space separated integers Ai, where i denotes the 'Class Random Number' of student i.
The next line of input contains T, the number of iterations involved in the process.
The next line of input contains Q, the number of queries the teacher is about to ask.
Q lines follow, each containing a single integer Si, indicating the ith student.(1 indexed)


 

Output
Output description.

For each query Si, output in a new line, the 'Class Random Number' of Student Si after 'T' iterations.

 

Constraints
Should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have. Format it like:

1 ≤ N ≤ 1000
1 ≤ Ai ≤ 100000
1 ≤ T ≤ 1000000000
1 ≤ Q ≤ 100
1 ≤ Si ≤ N

 

Example
Input:
4
1 2 3 4
4
3
2
1
3

Output:
202
201
203

 

Explanation
After 1st iteration, the 'CRN's would be 9 8 7 6
After 2nd iteration, the 'CRN's would be 21 22 23 24
After 3rd iteration, the 'CRN's would be 69 68 67 66
After 4th iteration, the 'CRN's would be 201 202 203 204
