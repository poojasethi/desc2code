The enemies of Flatland are planning on dropping several bombs on Flatland. Flatland can be represented as a 2 dimensional Cartesian plane. To decide where they will drop the bombs they follow a 2 step procedure.

Step 1:  They write down the co-ordinates (x,y) of N points. Then for the ith point with some probability they select it for Step 2, otherwise they throw it away.


Step 2: After step 1, they are left with a set of points. For all subsets of this set, they drop a bomb at the co-ordinates (X,Y) where:
X = sum of x of points in the subset.
Y = sum of y of points in the subset.



Lukas is in charge of the defense system of Flatland. He is supposed to set up a defensive shield in the shape of a convex polygon in such a way that any bomb that is dropped falls on an area covered by the shield. He is only allowed to set up 1 shield. Lukas doesn't like being wasteful and so the shield he sets up has the minimum area required. For different outcomes of Step 1, he will have to protect a different set of points. Now, he wants to know the expected area of the defensive shield he will set up.


Please refer to the sample case for clarification.


Input

The first line of input contains a single integer N denoting the number of points used in step 1 of the attack. The next N lines each contain 3 space-separated integers. The ith line contains xi, yi, probi, denoting the x co-ordinate, y co-ordinate and 100 times the probability of the ith point. In other words the probability that point i is selected for Step 2 is probi/100.


Output
In a single line print the expected area that will be covered by the defense system. Your answer will be considered correct if it has absolute or relative error less than 10^-2

Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 100000
1 ≤ xi,yi ≤ 10000
0 ≤ probi ≤ 100

Output:
0.2500000000


Explanation
There are 4 possible outcomes of Step 1:

Case 1: no points chosen for step 2: In this case, the only subset of this set is the empty set, and so a bomb will be dropped at (0,0). This means a shield covering just that single point is enough.
Case 2: only point 1 chosen for step 2: In this case, there are 2 subsets of the set. The empty set, and the set itself. So bombs will be dropped at (0,0) and (1,1). This means a shield covering the line joining those 2 points is enough.
Case 3: only point 2 chosen for step 2: In this case, there are 2 subsets of the set. The empty set, and the set itself. So bombs will be dropped at (0,0) and (2,1). This means a shield covering the line joining those 2 points is enough.
Case 4: all points chosen for step 2: In this case, there are 4 subsets of the set. So bombs will be dropped at (0,0),(1,1)(2,1) and (3,2). The smallest polygon covering all these points has an area of 1.


Each of the 4 cases has an equal probability of 0.25. So the expected area covered by the shield = 0.25*0 + 0.25*0 + 0.25*0 + 0.25*1 = 0.25.
