Lukas has mastered the art of division and wants to see how good you are. As a challenge he will ask you many questions. In each question he will give you 2 integers, N and K. All you have to do is tell him if N is divisible by K.


Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of questions Lukas will ask you. The next T lines each contain 2 space-separated integers N and K, denoting Lukas' question.

Output
For each question that Lukas asks print a single line saying "YES" (without quotation marks) if N is divisible by K and "NO" (without quotation marks) otherwise.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
1 ≤ N < 10^100
1 ≤ K ≤ 10


Example
Input:
3
12 3
100 6
2 1

Output:
YES
NO
YES

 

Explanation
Example case 1. 12 is divisible by 3
Example case 2. 100 is not divisible by 6
Example case 3. 2 is divisible by 1
