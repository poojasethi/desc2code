Tom started his coding in python and he never used C language for coding. Today he started to learn C language but unlike python C language contains semicolon in the end of the statement.Tom is a beginner in C language so he doesn't know more keywords in c language.Tom uses only few keywords in his C code.Because of using Python Tom strictly follow indentation in his code. Now Tom wants to count no. of semicolon mistakes in his C code.
 Rules where we use semicolon in C language code -

In general in the end of each line we use semicolon. 
If line contains while, for, if, else and data type function-name(arguments) we will not use semicolon.We will use only int, void, float and char for data type. 
We don't use semicolon after "{" and "}" symbol. 
We will not use semicolon at the end of line if line contains "#" symbol in the starting of statement. 
We will use "//" to indicates the end of program. Tom needs your help in making of this compiler.
