 
Problem description.
Chef is playing with 'n' set of planes. He notices that when two planes intersects a line is formed. Being that curious guy that chef already is, he wonders as to how many maximum possible line intersections can he obtain with his n set of planes.Given n set of planes find the maximum number of line intersections that can be seen via the intersections of n planes.

Input

The first line contains the number of test cases, t
The t lines that follow contain a number n denoting the number of planes

 

Output
For each of the t test cases print the result
 

Constraints

1 <= t <= 10^5
1 <= n <= 10^9

 

Example
Input:
2

3

Output:
