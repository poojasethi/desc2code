Michael, Kevin and Jake are sharing a cake, in celebration of their Webby award. They named it VCake. Unlike other cakes they considered, this one has finite volume and surface area. It's shaped as a normal rectangular cake with dimensions R centimeters by C centimeters. For the purposes of this problem, we can forget about three dimensions and think of a cake as just a 2D rectangle.
Chef will now cut the cake into three pieces, one for each person. However, the cake's shape and Chef's really old tools pose a few restrictions:

Chef can only cut the cake, or a cake piece, across a line parallel to one of its sides. 
Chef can only cut the cake, or a cake piece, from end to end. That is, she cannot cut the cake partially. 
Chef can only cut the cake, or a cake piece, such that the sides of the resulting pieces (which will be rectangular in shape) are integers. 

In addition, Michael, Kevin and Jake also have a few preferences of their own:

They want their pieces to be connected (in one piece), and rectangular in shape.
Michael wants his piece to have an area exactly M square centimeters. (Again, forget about a third dimension.)
Kevin wants his piece to have an area exactly K square centimeters.
Jake wants his piece to have an area exactly J square centimeters.

With these restrictions, Chef is at a loss. Is it possible for Chef to accomplish this task? 
Please note that the entire cake should be used. There should be no leftover cake.

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
Each test case consists of a single line containing five space separated integers R, C M, K and J.

Output
For each test case, output a single line containing either “Yes” or “No” (without quotes), denoting whether Chef can accomplish the task or not.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ R, C ≤ 10^9
1 ≤ M, K, J ≤ 10^18


Example
Input:
4
4 5 10 4 6
4 5 6 10 4
4 5 4 6 10
2 2 2 2 2

Output:
Yes
Yes
Yes
No

Explanation
Example case 1. In this case, Chef can accomplish the task by doing the following slicing. 


Example case 4. Here, Michael, Kevin and Jake each wants a piece with area 2, but the total area of the cake is only 2×2 = 4. This means the task is impossible.
