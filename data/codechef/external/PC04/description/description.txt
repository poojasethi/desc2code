You are provided with coordinates of four points as input and your task is to determine whether they form a Quadrilateral, Parallelogram, Square, Rhombus, Rectangle or None of These.
It is safe to assume that the four points entered are in the order of A, B, C, D and you have to determine which quadrilateral (or none) is formed by ABCD. 

Input
The first line of the input is the number of test cases T.
Every test case consists of four lines, each line containing two numbers X and Y separated by a space which refer to the (x,y) coordinates of a point. The first line contains the coordinates of point A, second of point B, third of point C and fourth of point D.


Output
For each test case, the output shall be a single word answer (in capital letters) stating whether the coordinates of each test case forms a “RECTANGLE”, “SQUARE”, “RHOMBUS”, “QUADRILATERAL”, “PARALLELOGRAM” or “NONE” (without quotes; quotes only for clarity) . 
Note:
We know that a square is also a rectangle which is also a parallelogram which in turn is also a quadrilateral, however if the input satisfies all the properties of a specific type of a quadrilateral, the answer shall be that specific type of a quadrilateral ONLY and not any other type or simply ‘QUADRILATERAL’. 

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤  100 
-10000 ≤ X,Y ≤ 10000, where (X,Y) denote the coordinates of point A, B, C or D.
