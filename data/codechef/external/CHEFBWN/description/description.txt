Chef has recently noticed that demand for brownie is increasing rapidly. So, he decided to install N machines to cater to the increasing demand. All machines are numbered from 1 to N. To use the machines, Chef has to enter two numbers l and r, such that all the machines numbered from l to r inclusive produce a single brownie.
Now, you are given N numbers where the i^th number denotes the number of brownies produced by i^th machine till now. After that, there will be M queries where each query contains two numbers l and r. Now, our Chef wants to know how many brownies have been produced till now by each machine after M queries.

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space separated integer N and M.The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the number of brownies produced by each machine before queries.Then M lines follow where each line contains two space separated integer l and r". 


Output

For each test case, output a single line containing N space separated integers denoting the numbers of brownies produced by each machine after all the M queries.


Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 30
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ M ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ Ai ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ N


Example
Input:
1
8 4
2 3 4 6 9 1 7 8
2 4
3 7
1 5
7 8

Output:
3 5 7 9 11 2 9 9
 

Explanation
There is only one test case.
After the first query, the number of brownies will be 2 4 5 7 9 1 7 8.
After the second query, the number of brownies will be 2 4 6 8 10 2 8 8.
After the third query, the number of brownies will be 3 5 7 9 11 2 8 8.
After the fourth query, the final number of brownies will be 3 5 7 9 11 2 9 9
