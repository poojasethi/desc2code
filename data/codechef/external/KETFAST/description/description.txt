 
Find the fastest way to type a word, given the word. You can skip total of T letters. Time needed to write a letter is given in an array with 26 integers depicting the time needed to type the alphabets. Index 0 will represent a, 1 will represent b, 2 will represent c till 25 representing z. Print the fastest time needed to write the word, after skipping T letters.
Note: Each letter must be treated distinctly, example, if word is aaa and you can skip 1 letter, then you should type aa and not skip all the a's.

Input
Input description.
Input will start will an integer N on newline representing the count of test case. Each case will contain a number T on a newline, representing total count of letters you can skip. Next line of each test case will contain 26 integers representing the array of time needed to write letters a to z. Next line of each test case will contain the word that you need to type.
 

Output
For each test case print the desired outputs, each on a newline.
 

Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 10
1 ≤ Time needed for each letter ≤ 300
1 ≤ Length of word ≤ 10
1 ≤ T ≤ length of given  word

 

Example
Input:
1
1
100 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26
abac
Output:
105 

Explanation
Example case 1. one a can be skipped, requiring time 105 to write the word.
