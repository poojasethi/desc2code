Great Work!!! Now that we have the executable code for this cyber weapon, it cannot be put to misuse by the hacker anywhere else if can develop the source code first. He gave the name "Newton's Wrath" to this weapon. It is a program that corrupts data to an irrecoverable state. Now we must find the source code before the hacker put this code to any misuse any where else...
