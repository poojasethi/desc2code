The expression N!, read as "N factorial," denotes the product of the first N positive integers, where N is nonnegative. So, for example,



 N       N!

 0       1

 1       1

 2       2

 3       6

 4      24

 5     120

10 3628800



For this problem, you are to write a program that can compute the last non-zero digit of any factorial for (0 ≤ N ≤ 10000). For example, if your program is asked to compute the last nonzero digit of 5!, your program should produce "2" because 5! = 120, and 2 is the last nonzero digit of 120. 




Input


The input will consist of a sequence of integers. The sequence will be followed by Zero. 


Output


For each integer input, the program should print exactly one line of output which must be the single last non-zero digit of N!.
