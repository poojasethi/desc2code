Its celebration time in Byteland. Chef Forgetful has just had twins.
But chef, as his name suggests, he is very forgetful! He even forgets all the names he had come up with earlier. So he asks his friends to help him decide. But since he is very likely to forget two different names, he wants one to be the anagram of other.
Help chef decide whether the given names are anagrams of one another.
NOTE: Anagrams are words formed by rearranging the letters of another, such as “cinema” and “iceman” are anagrams.
INPUT

OUTPUT

CONSTRAINTS
