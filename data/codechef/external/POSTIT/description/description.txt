Adele is doing research in the field of computational biology this summer. She has a DNA sequence D, which is made of a smaller sequence S concatenated K times, i.e, D = S + S + S + ... (K times). Now, she needs to generate the sequence D using a smaller sequence, T of length M, of which she will make N copies. Doing this she'll get F = T + T + ... (N times).
Each DNA sequence can be represented as a string made up of lowercase latin characters.
After she gets F, she can extract out each individual component from the sequence(i.e, characters) and join them together(in some order) to make a new sequence which is equal to D.
Now, she wonders, given S, K and M what would be the minimum no. of copies N, of T, she will have to make in order to find T such that she can get D. She wants your help.
For given DNA sequence S, the number of it's copies, K and the length of the sequnce T as M, print the minimum number of copies, N, of T which you will have to create and also print the lexicographic smallest such sequence T. Print -1, if not possible.


Input
The input contains 2 lines:

 The first line contains the string S, the DNA sequence.
 The second line contains two space separated numbers integers K and M, denoting the number of copies of S in D and the length of the sequence T.


Output

 First line containing an integer N and string T, denoting the minimum number of copies.
 Second line containing the string T.
 Print -1 in one line if it's not possible to find such N and T.

Explanation
Sample 1:  S = mama, K = 2. D = mamamama. For T = aamm and N = 2, we can get F = aammaamm.
The characters of F can be used to make a copy of T here.
Sample 2:  S = aab, K = 2. D = aabaab. For T = ab and N = 4, we can get F = abababab.
The characters of F can be used to make a copy of T here.
