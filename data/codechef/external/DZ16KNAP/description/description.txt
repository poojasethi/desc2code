You are given a rooted tree with N nodes rooted at node 1. Each node v is associated with two numbers Capacity Cv and Profit Pv. Your task is to select a subset S = {s1, s2,....sk} of nodes of this tree, such that the value Q = Ps1 + Ps2+.....+ Psk is maximized. Also, for any node v of the tree, there should not be more than Cv nodes from sub tree rooted at v in S.

Input
The first line of input contains a number N, denoting the size of the tree. Next N lines contains 2 space separated integers each representing the value Ci and Pi.
 Next N - 1 lines follow. Each of the next N - 1 lines contain 2 space separated integers x and y denoting the edge between node x and node y.

Output
Output in one line a single integer denoting the maximum value of Q.

Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ Cv ≤ N
1 ≤ Pv ≤ 10^9
