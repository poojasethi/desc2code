 
Given a linear equation in one variable of the form num1 operator num2 = num3 where any one of num1, num2 or num3 is the variable x and other two are integers. Operators can be any one of  + ,  -  ,  /  or  * , there may or may not be spaces given between the numbers and operator or ‘=’ sign. 
Find the value of x.
Note: The equation will always be a valid equation.
 

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
Each test case contain a single line denoting the linear equation.

 

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing the value of x correct upto 6 places of decimal.

 

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
the numbers in the equation lies in between -10^9 and 10^9 except 0

 

Example
Input:
3
1+x=12
12 /x =2
-8*-x =8

Output:
11.000000
6.000000
1.000000
