Many years ago there was a kingdom called 'sentence', which comprises of two groups namely strings and integers. Strings consists of all the characters and alphabets(both capital and small) whereas the integers consists of all 
the kinds of numbers. 'A' was the leader of strings and was prefer over '0' the leader of integers by the people of the kingdom. King of the sentences was very old, so he kept a competition for deciding the 
next king. In the competition only 'A' and '0' participated. '0' knew that he was going to lose in the competition so he attacked on the strings. String 'X' came running to 'A' and told him that '0' is going to kill all 
the strings. 'A ' is terrified and wants to protect his group. He knows that if he wants to stop '0' he needs to remove all the integers from kingdom. So he asks your help in killing all the integers. Help 'A' in 
removing all the integers from the kingdom and hence protect all the strings.

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
 Next T lines contain a sentence 'S' formed from integers and strings. The length of S is denoted by L.
(it is guaranteed that after killing all the integers, L>0).


Output

Print the sentence consisting of only strings in the given order.



Constraints
