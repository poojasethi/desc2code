So the Chef has become health conscious and is now lifting weights at the gym. But its his first time so the trainer gives him a simple job to do. 

He has been given a weight lifting rod and N heavy weights, each weighing 2^0, 2^1, .... , 2^n-1. He has to stick each of the "N" weights on the rod, one after another, in such a way that the right side is never heavier than the left side. At each step he chooses one of the weights that has not yet been fixed on the rod, and fix it on either the left side of the rod or the right, until all of the weights have been placed.

Now help the chef and find out, in how many ways the chef can accomplish this?
