Work's on at full flow at the Indian National Security Autonomous Force, known as INSAF in short. Few know that employees of this particular agency are amongst the highest paid in the country. In the digital age of today, information is power and everything must be done to secure it. This force does not entertain any job applications take out any ads in the public, instead it recruits its workforce by handpicking them from different professions in the country. That was exactly how you were recruited, and now you're a part of an elite team working on creating mutating encryption algorithms for secure transmission of sensitive data. You have been given the task of generating an algorithm for transmission of numerical values. For a given non negative integer number N, you must generate a code to find the minimal natural number Q such that the product of all digit s in Q is equal to N.


Input:

The first line will consist of the one number of test cases T.
The next T lines will consist of one string of a non negative number N.


Output:

For each test case, output is a number Q,that will form the number by mutliplying each digits. Print '-10' if no such number exists. 



Example:
Input:
3
1
10
123456789



Output:
1
25
-10
