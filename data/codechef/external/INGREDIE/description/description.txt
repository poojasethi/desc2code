  You are given n cities with m bi-directional roads connecting them and the
  length of each road. There are two friends living in different cities who wish
  to collect some ingredients available at different stores to make cake. There
  are s such stores. They need not come back home after purchasing the
  ingredients. Petrol is expensive and they would hence like to travel minimum
  total distance (sum of distance distance traveled by both kids). Help them
  find out what this distance is.
  

Input Format:

n m
  (m lines of the form ai bi ci)
  Here n is number of cities, m is number of roads, ai and bi are the cities(0
  indexed) the roads connect and ci is the length of this road
s where s is the number of stores
  (1 line containing s space separated integers indicating the city number in
  which the stores are located.)
  (two space separated integers indicating the cities in which the two kids
  live)
  

Output Format:

  Single integer x where x is the minimum distance that the duo will travel that
  is minimum sum of distance travelled by first kid and second kid.
  

Constraints:

  2 ≤ n ≤ 100
  1 ≤ m ≤ (n*(n-1))/2
  0 ≤ a,b < n
  0 ≤c≤ 1000
  1 ≤ s ≤ 8
