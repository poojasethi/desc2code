The Hostel LAN connection is to be laid down. Rooms in the Hostel lie all in a straight line. It is always desired to use minimum number of cable wires for this work and all the rooms receive the LAN service. A room can either get connected to main line or it can get connected to a room to its immediate let or right provided the latter room is already getting the LAN service.
You are to write a program that determines the number of different combinations of the cable wires that is possible so that every room receives the service.

example for 3 rooms:

 
 	M           M               M
            / \         /                      \
          1  2      1-2                1-2

M represent the Main center and 1 and 2 represents the rooms.
In first, Main is connected to both.
In second, Main is connected to 1 and 1 is connected to 2.
In third, Main is connected to 2 and 2 is connected to 1.     

Input
Each line of input contains a positive integer N (N â‰¤ 40), the number of rooms.There is only one main supply. A value of 0 for N indicates the end of input which should not be processed.Terminate the input with a zero.



Output
For each line of input you have to output, on a single line, the number of possible arrangements. Output will be less than 2^64 - 1.



Example

Input:
