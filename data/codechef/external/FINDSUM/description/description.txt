You are given the easiest task. Given an array of positive numbers, you have to print the maximum number of non overlapping subarrays with sum equal to a given integer K. If there are no such subarray, print 0
 

Input
Input description.

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers N and K denoting the size of the array and required sum respectively. The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the array. 

 

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing the maximum number of non-overlapping subarrays with sum = K.

 

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 20
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6
Sum of N over all test cases = 10^6
1 ≤ Ai , K ≤ 10^9
