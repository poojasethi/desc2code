John studies in 10 standards. One day he forgets to do his Maths homework. So his maths teacher gave him a punishment. He gave him some big numbers (8 or 9 digits numbers) and asked john to prepare the list of their prime factors in ascending order. John needs to prepare a separate list for each number. John apologizes for his mistake and promises that this type of activity will never happen again. Now teacher decided to give some relaxation to John. Now he told that he just needs to find the last element/number of that long list of prime factors that he was preparing for each number. But John still doesn’t know how to find that last number. Could you help John?  

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases and then followed by t positive integers for which you need to find the last number of the list of its prime factors in ascending order.

Output
For each test case output a single positive number that will be the last element of the list of its prime factors in ascending order.

Constraints
Should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have. Format it like:

1 ≤ T ≤ 10
2 ≤ n ≤ 1000000000000000

 

Example
Input:
2
102
113


Output:
17
113

 

Explanation
The list of prime factors of 102 in ascending order is: 2,3,17 , so last number is 17.
The number 113 is prime in itself, so the list of prime factors of 113 in ascending order is: 113, so last number is 113.
