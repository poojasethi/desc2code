 

Mr. M wants a partner for the FooBar's contest. He goes to Mr. H to ask him to be his partner. Mr. H being a clever person says, “if you can answer my problem correctly, I will surely be your partner.”
The problem states - “Given an array of N numbers A1, A2, ... Ai, Ai+1, ... AN-1, AN, first find number of numbers such that gcd(Ai, i) = perfect square. Don’t consider 1 to be a perfect square. Let K be this number. Now give the product of largest K numbers in array A. Since youranswer can be large, print your answer modulo (10^9 + 7). If there is no such number, print 1.”
Mr. M accepts his challenge. However he isn’t sure whether he will be able to solve the question. Can you help Mr. M solve the problem?


Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
Each test case consists of 2 lines. First line contains a single integer N denoting the size of the array A. Next line contains N space separated integers denoting the elements of the array.
 

Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the product of largest K numbers in array A modulo 10^9 + 7
 

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 10^2
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6
1 ≤ Ai ≤ 10^6
