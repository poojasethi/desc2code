Problem Description
Swapanti was born on the 9th of October, '95. Coincidentally, her best friend was also born on the same day. As a result, she has started liking 9's and 5's a lot. She tries to include it in everything she does. Her email-id has those 2 numbers. Even all the digits of her mobile number are either 9 of 5. She gets her roll number changed if the digits are anything other than 9 and 5. Clearly, she is obsessed with 9's and 5's. Given any number N, she wants to find her next smallest favourite number M greater than N. She is also a bit lazy. Help her in finding M.


Input
First line of the input will consist of T, the number of test cases. Each of the next T lines contains a single number N.


Output
For each test case print Swapanti's next favourite number M, in a new line.
