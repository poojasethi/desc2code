The success of IEEE code-quest depends on number of times the factor is present in a given string.Help core members to find them
 Factor of string is defined as a substring.In this case it's '01'.

Input
First line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then follows description of T cases.Each line of input is a binary form.
 

Output
Print the number of times the factor is present in a given string.
 

Constraints

1 <= T <= 50

 

Example
Input:
1
1001010100001

Output:
