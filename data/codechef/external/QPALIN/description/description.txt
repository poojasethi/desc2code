The problem is:
You are given a string of length n consisting of lowercase letters. There will be two kinds of operations:

1 x k : set xth character (1-based) in the string equal to k
2 l r : answer whether any permutation of the set of characters taken from position l to r makes a palindrome.


Input
The first line will contain length of the string n.
Next line will contain string of length n.
The next line will have integer m, number of queries
Next m lines will follow the queries of the type mentioned above.
In the first type of query x will be an integer and k will be a character.
In the second type l and r will be two integers
 

Output
For each query of second type answer "YES" if you can make palindrome by taking permutation of the characters from l to r. Otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).
 

Constraints
1<=x<=n
1<=l<=r<=n
k will be in [a,z]
Example
Input:
7
abbacca
6
2 1 4
1 1 z
2 1 4
1 4 z
2 1 4
2 5 7
 
Output:
YES
NO
YES
YES
 

Explanation
Example case 1.
For first query, letters in the range 1 to 4 are (a,b,b,a) and we can form "abba" or "baab" as palindrome.
For third query letters in the range 1 to 4 are (z,b,b,a) and we can't make any palindrome from it.
For the last query letters in the range 5 to 7 are (c,c,a) and we can form "cac" as a palindrome.
