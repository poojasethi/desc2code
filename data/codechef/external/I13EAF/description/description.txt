Explanation
Firoz has 2 friends because:
Firoz has 3 enemies: Bobby, Johnny, Geeta
Bobby has 4 enemies: Firoz, Amit, Johnny, lata
Johnny has 2 enemies: Bobby, Firoz
geeta has 2 enemies: lata, Firoz
Therefore the enemies of the enemies of Firoz are Amit, Johnny, lata, Bobby, Firoz
To be Firoz's friends they must not be his enemies so Johnny and Bobby must be removed
Firoz cannot be his own friend so we remove Firoz from his friends
So the friends of Firoz are Amit, lata: 2 friends
