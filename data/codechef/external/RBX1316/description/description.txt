 
Magic Number is back again. This time the magic number is a positive integer that is divisible by the sum of its digits. Write a program that determines how many magic numbers are in the largest consecutive sequence of magic numbers in a given range.

 

Input
The first line in the input consists of the lower bound L of the range while the second line consists of the upper bound U of the range. The U and L is between 1 and 10000. L is always less than U.
 

Output
The output will give the length of the largest consecutive sequence of magic numbers.
 

Example
Input:
500
525

Output:
4
