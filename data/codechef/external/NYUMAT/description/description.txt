You have an N×N matrix of integers. You may perform four types of operations on the matrix:

Choose a row and increment every integer in this row by one.
Choose a row and decrement every integer in this row by one.
Choose a column and increment every integer in this column by one.
Choose a column and decrement every integer in this column by one.


You may perform the above operations any number of times. Is it possible that all the integers in the given matrix become zeros in the end?

Input
The input begins with the number of test cases T.
Each test case has an integer N on the first line. Then N lines follow. Each line has N space separated integers giving one row of the matrix.

Output
For each case, output "Yes" if you can turn all integers in the given matrix into zeros. Otherwise output "No".


Constraints

T ≤ 100 
1 ≤ N ≤ 50
The absolute value of any integer in the matrix does not exceed 100


Example
Input:
2
3
2 1 0
1 0 -1
2 1 0
2
1 0
0 0

Output:
Yes
No

Explanation
Example 1: You may decrement the first and last row, decrement the first column and increment the last column.
