 
Problem description:
Ternary computing is commonly implemented in terms of balanced ternary,which uses the three digits -1,0,+1.The negative value of any balanced ternary digit can be obtained by replacing every '+' with a '-' and vice versa.
Balanced ternary can express negative values as a positive ones,without the need for a leading negative sign as with decimal numbers.The balanced ternary number is created by balancing ternary(Base 3) Numbers around the center of a number line,0.A balanced ternary number is a combination of negative and positive ternary numbers.Because you could represent any number simply using three symbols:|,- and 0 placed in values of 3^0,3^1,3^2 and so on.

N is the integer that should be converted into balanced ternary number.

Input

The only line of the input to the problem contains integer N.

 

Output

Output a single line containing the answer to the corresponding test case in the form of |,-and 0 corresponding to the power of three places.

 

Constraints

-100000 ≤ N ≤ 100000

 

Example
Input:
89

Output:
|0|0-
 

Explanation:
Example case 1: The answer is +81+9-1=+3^4+3^2-3^0=|0|0-
