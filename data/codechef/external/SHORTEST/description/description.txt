Given an undirected weighted graph with n nodes and m edges, find the shortest distance from the first node to the x^th node (1-based index).


Input / Output

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
In each test case, the first line contains 3 integers, n, m and q denoting the number of nodes in the graph, the number of edges in the graph and the number of queries for shortest path. This is followed by m lines, each containing 3 integers, a, b and w, denoting an edge between a and b with weight w. These are followed by q lines containing a single integer each, x. For each of these x, output the total weight of the shortest path from node 1 to x (1-based indexing) on a single line.
