Sam has pencils of different lengths, that follow an order. If he has n pencils than their lengths are in increasing order starting from 1, for example: if he has 4 pencils then they are of length 1,2,3,4. Thus if he has n pencils, then he has exactly one pencil of each the lengths from 1 through n.


Input
Each test case will contain an integer n(3<=n<=1000000), the number of pencils in samâ€™s collection.Terminate the input with n=0.


Output
For each test case, output on a line the number of different triangles you can make with sam's pencils. Triangles X and Y are different if there is at least one pencil in X that is not in Y. A triangle has area strictly greater than 0.
