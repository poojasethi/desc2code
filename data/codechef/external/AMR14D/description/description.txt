The Cricket World Cup 2015 is nearing and it will be held in Australia and New Zealand. The organizing committee is planning to give a welcome gift to each team member. After careful thought and planning, they have decided on Matryoshka dolls. 
A Matryoshka doll refers to a set of wooden dolls of strictly decreasing size, placed one inside the other. Any doll can contain only one doll directly inside it.
Given the sizes of N dolls, output "YES" if it is possible to nest them all and have one doll on the outside and "NO" otherwise.
Input - The input starts with T denoting the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains N, which is the total number of dolls. The second line contains N space separated integers denoting the size of the dolls.
Output -  Print “YES” if the dolls can be nested inside each other and “NO” otherwise. (quotes for clarity)
Constraints - 1 <= T <= 100 1 <= N <= 100 1 <= doll size <= 1000
Sample Input -  3 3 3 1 1 2  1 2 4 10 2 5 3  
Sample Output - NO YES YES
Explanation - For the first case, there are 2 dolls of size 1 and hence cannot be nested inside each other. For the second case, the doll with size 1 can be put inside the doll with size 2.
