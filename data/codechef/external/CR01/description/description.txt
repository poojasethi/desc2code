POINTS - 20
 
You are given a square board of size n*n. Calculate the total no of squares that are there in it(with integer side lengths) and the total area enclosed within these squares.
For example- Suppose there is a board of size 2*2 then there are four squares of size 1*1 and one square of size 2*2. So total no of squares is 5 and total area is 8.


Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
An integer N  which is the size of square board in each test case.

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing.Two integers- the total no of squares and total area.Both answers should be remainder modulo 10^6
