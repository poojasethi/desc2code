 
Ramesh and Suresh are playing a game. Ramesh will give Suresh a question to solve and vice versa. So, Ramesh gave Suresh a string consisting of digits from (1 to 9). He also gave him two integers A and B and told him to cut the string S minimum number of times such that every part lies in the range [A,B]. Since, Suresh is weak in programming, he has asked for your help in finding the answer.
 

Input
First line consists of an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Next T lines consists of a string S and two integers A and B.

Output
A single integer denoting the minimum number of cuts of string S such that every part lies in [A,B].
Print "-1" without the quotes if Suresh is not able to cut the string according to the given conditions.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ |S| ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ A ≤ B ≤ 10^9

 

Example
Input:
3
1236 1 6
12315 1 15
5423 1 4

Output:
3
2
-1
 

Explanation
Test case 1: The string can be divided into minimum 4 parts - "1","2","3","6". So 3 cuts are required.
Test case 2: The string can be divided into minimum 3 parts - "12","3","15". So 2 cuts are required.
Test case 3: The string cannot be divided into parts which lies in [1,4], hence answer is -1.
