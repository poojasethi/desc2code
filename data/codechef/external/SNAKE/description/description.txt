PJ and his friend, AJ are having a walk in a square field of size N x N. A snake bites AJ at position (N,1) [1-based indexing] and tries to escape; it moves inside the field in a special manner. PJ being quite intellegent, manages to predict where the snake will be at any given point in time. 

The pattern below shows how the snake will move in a 4x4 field. The values in each position are the number of seconds the snake takes to arrive there after biting AJ.

7   13  14   16
6    8   12   15
2    5    9    11
1    3    4    10

If PJ chooses a value of (X, Y) to place a box and capture the snake, can you tell how many seconds after biting AJ, the snake will be at (X, Y)?

Input
The first line contains T, the number of test cases. This is followed by T lines, each containing 3 space separated integers: N, X, Y.

Output
For each test case, output a line containing the time the snake takes to arrive at (X, Y).

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 500
1 ≤ N ≤ 1000
1 ≤ X ≤ N
1 ≤ Y ≤ N


Example
Input:
2
4 2 3
6 1 5

Output:
12
34

Explanation
Example case 1. Refer to the pattern shown above. The snake is present at position (2,3) at 12 seconds
