 
Everyone knows the God of Cricket , Sachin Tendulkar , and his cricket records are marvellous . One day, Bob tried to make a list of his (Sachin) runs , he scored in each match . He(Bob) was getting bored in collecting the data so he decided determine whether the runs scored by Sachin in a particular range are in AP or not . Bob also make mistakes in his list . So he will also update the list frequently.
 

Input
First line contains ‘n’ total no of matches . Next line contains n space separated integers the runs scored by Sachin in these matches (F[i])  .Then next line contains an integer ‘Q’ , the no of ranges , Bob wishes to determine about . Then Q lines proceed containing three A,B,C integers if, A is 1 , then B and C describe the range (1 based ). if , A is 0 then B represents the match no for which Bob wishes to update runs for (1 based) and C represents value to which the runs of match B are changed to .

Output
For each query of type 1 , print ‘’1”  if range is in AP or “0” (quotes for clarity) if range is not in AP . Print your answer per line for each query of type 1.

Constraints

1<= n <=100000
1<= Q <=100000
0<= F[i] <= 10^9
0<= A <=1
1<= B <= n
If , A=1 , 1<= C <= n , B <= C
If, A=0 , 1<= C <= 20000

 

Example
Input:
5
2 3 4 5 6 
3
1 2 4
0 3 6
1 2 4

Output:
1
0

 

Explanation
First query , the sequence 3 4 5 is an AP
Second query , element at index 3 ie,. 4 is changed to 6
Third query , the sequence 3 6 5 is not an AP
