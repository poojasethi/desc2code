Bob fell in love with LCM and GCD. So much that he started seeing LCMs and GCDs everywhere.
Betty, his girl friend was jealous and she gave Bob an array A[ ] of integers, which had nothing to do with LCMs or GCDs.
Quickly, naughty Bob evaluated a new array B[ ] containing n integers, such that B[i] is LCM(1,2,3,...,A[i]), if A[i]>0. When A[i] is 0, B[i] is also 0.
Angry Betty decided to give m queries to Bob, each being one of the following type:
-   "0 i j p", meaning add 'p' to each element in A[i..j]. ( -300000 ≤ p ≤ 300000)
-   "1 i j"    , meaning print the LCM of all elements in B[i..j]. 0 ≤ i
-   "2 i j"    , meaning print the GCD of all elements in B[i..j].0 ≤ i

Input
First line contains n(n ≤ 100000 ) and m( m ≤ 35000 ).
Second line contains n integers in the original array A[ ] .
Next m lines contain one of the above said queries.
It is guaranteed that A[i] after any number of updates will satisfy 0 ≤ A[i] ≤ 300000.

Output
Output one line for each query of type 1 or 2, modulo 1000000007.
