You are given N lines (which extend indefinitely in both directions) on the X-Y plane. Some of these lines intersect with each other and others don't (parallel lines). We call each such intersection, an intersection point. You have to find the K^th intersection from the bottom.


In particular, you have to output the smallest value V, such that there are at least K intersection points whose Y-coordinate is ≤ V.


If m lines intersect at a particular point, that point is counted m(m-1)/2 times. That is, if only two lines intersect at a point, it is counted as one intersection point. But if three lines intersect at the same point, it is counted as 3 intersection points: one for each pair.


You are guaranteed that all the N lines are distinct, and that there are at least K intersection points between the lines.


Input Format:

The first line contains the two integers N and K.


The next N lines contain two space separated integers each. The (i+1)^th line contains Mi and Ci, such that the equation y = Mi*x + Ci, denotes the i^th line.


Output Format:

Output one value denoting V as defined in the problem, which should be within 10^-2 of the correct answer.


Constraints:

1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
K  ≥ 1
It is guaranteed that there are at least K intersection points. That is, 1 ≤ K ≤ number of intersection points in the input data
-20000 ≤ Mi ≤ 20000 and Mi ≠ 0
-20000 ≤ Ci ≤ 20000
It is guaranteed that there are no i and j, such that i ≠ j and (Mi = Mj) and (Ci = Cj)


Example:

Input 1:
4 6
-1 2
-3 -1
3 1
-4 1

Output 1:
3.5

Explanation:
There are 6 intersection points in total. Therefore, we want the y-coordinate of the highest intersection point. We see that the highest intersection point is (-1.5,3.5), and hence the answer is 3.5.


Input 2:
4 3
-10 -6
-5 -10
2 1
4 -8

Output 2:
-7.429
