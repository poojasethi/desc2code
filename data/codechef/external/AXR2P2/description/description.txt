Our college's best band VAPOUR SUNDAY is getting bigger and bigger by playing in many places, they rocked AAROHI09 and are a very famous band in the Central India, and the band's lead guitarist Karan kalanis music collection is getting bigger so he plans to write every bands songs into a CD and gave all of this job to his manager T Pramod. As the number of CDs increased, Pramod built his boss a shelf on which the CDs stand vertically. But Pramod now needs your help! he has written a title for each CD into a text file, but he needs the titles to appear vertically so that he can put them in the spine of the CD cases and be able to read them easily from the shelf. Pramod wants you to write a program that will output the titles vertically. He needs lines between each title so that, when he prints them, he can easily cut along the lines. He has worked out that he can fit 36 characters into the available space, so all output titles must be 36 characters long, padded with spaces at the end where necessary. If he accidentally makes a title too long, only output the first 36 characters. 



CAN YOU HELP PRAMOD????


Input


Input will be at most 50 titles, one to a line. Each title consists of 1 to 100 arbitrary characters('A'-'Z', 'a'-'z', '0'-'9' and space are valid characters). A single `#' on a line by itself indicates the end of input. 


Output


Output will be the same titles presented vertically, where the left to right order will be the same as the order of the input. There will be a column of bar (`|') characters at each end, and separating each title, and a row of minus (`-') characters (1 per column) at the beginning and end.
