You are given a cyclic array A having N numbers.

In an XOR round, each element of the array A is replaced by the bitwise XOR (Exclusive OR) of itself, the previous element, and the next element in the array. All operations take place simultaneously. Can you calculate A after K such XOR rounds ?


Input
The first line contains the number of test cases T (T ≤ 50).

There follow 2T lines, 2 per test case. The first line contains two space seperated integers N (3 ≤ N ≤ 500) and K (1 ≤ K ≤ 1000000000). The next line contains N space seperated integers Ai (0 ≤ Ai ≤ 1000000000), which are the initial values of the elements in array A. 




Output
Output T lines, one per test case. For each test case, output a space seperated list of N integers, specifying the contents of array A after K XOR rounds.


Example

Input:
2
3 1
1 2 3
5 100
1 11 111 1111 11111

Output:
0 0 0
11117 101 1075 12127 12081
