 
Its axis time and the event managers are busy conducting meetings or their events. Each event manager is  seating on a vertex of a table having shape of a regular polygon.
The table has n vertices where n is the number of event managers in the meeting. 
Your task is to count the number of isosceles triangles formed such that each vertex of the triangle is a vertex of the table and all managers seating on these 3 vertices are of same gender.
 

Input
The first line contains an integer T. T testcases follow.
For each test case, there is only one line, which consists of a 01-string with length ≥ 2. 
Number of vertices n of the regular
polygon equals length of the string.

The string represents gender of managers seating on the vertices in clockwise order. 0 represents girls and 1 represents boys.

Output
For each test case, output one line in the format Case #t: ans, where t is the case number (starting from 1), and ans is the answer. 

Constraints
Sum of all n in the input <= 10^6
 

Example
Input:
5
01
0001
10001
111010
1101010

Output:
Case 1: 0
Case 2: 1
Case 3: 1
Case 4: 2
Case 5: 3
 

Explanation
In case 5, indices of vertices of the three monochromatic isosceles triangles are (0,3,5), (1,3,5) and (2,4,6) (assuming indices
start from 0)
