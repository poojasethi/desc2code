A war between Wonderland and Lierland started.
So our leader WonderKing had to go to the war base,
but he is going to miss his love WonderQueen. So
WonderKing decided to send messages often to WonderQueen,
 but did not want any other to read them and understand the
 messages, so he used a strange language Pig Latin.
 It is not related to pigs or Latin. But it was a safe language.
The usual rules for changing standard English into Pig Latin are as follows:

In words that begin with consonant sounds, the initial letter is moved to the end of the word, and "ay" is added, as in the following examples:

happy --> appyhay
question --> uestionqay

In words that begin with vowel (a , e , I , o , u) letter the syllable "way" is simply added to the end of the word.
another --> anotherway
about --> aboutway

As he wants to send messages recently to WonderQueen king wants you to provide a program for him.Your program to this problem is simply a English to Pig Latin converter adhering to above rules.
