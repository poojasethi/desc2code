 
The Agrawals have a habit of having repeated characters consecutively in their surnames. For example, you can find various people with surnames Aggrawal, Agrrawal, Agrawaal, etc. 
Mr. Abhishek Agrawal is given some strings. He tries to make the strings resemble his surname and likes it when strings have characters that repeat more than once consecutively.

More formally, given a string S of length N. He can choose a set T(possibly empty) containing indices of the string S. An index i can belong to the set T if character at the i^th index is not equal to all of its adjacent characters. Help Mr. Agrawal to find the total number of such distinct sets possible.


Input

First line of the input contains T denoting number of test cases. Each test case has exactly one line consisting of the input string S.


Output
For each test case, output the answer in a separate line.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
1 ≤ N ≤ 50
S consists of lowercase english alphabets

 

Example
Input:

4
xy
aaa
xxyx
a

Output:

4
1
4
2
 

Explanation

We will consider a 0-based indexed string here.
Example case 1: He can choose various sets of indices including {0, 1} , {0}, {1}, {} since each position i in the set does not have they same neighboring character as itself. In total, we can form 4 distinct sets.
Example case 2: He can not choose any set besides the {} (empty) set. Each index i has the same neighboring character as itself. Hence, it is not possible to include any of the index in any of the set. Hence, answer is 1.
