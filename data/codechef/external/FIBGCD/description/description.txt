Problem Statement
 A Fibonacci series is defined as f(0) = 0 , f(1) = 1 and f(i) = f(i-1) + f(i-2) for i>1 .
 Gcd of 2 numbers is the greatest common divisor of the 2 numbers.
 In this problem problem you will be given 2 numbers a and b and you are supposed to find f ( gcd(a,b) ) mudulo 10^9+7 .

Input Format
The first line contains an integet T which denotes the number of test cases . Then T lines follow each having 2 integers A and B . 

Output
For each test case , output 1 integer in each line which is the value of f ( gcd(A,B) ) modulo 10^9 + 7.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10000
1 ≤ A ≤ 1000000
1 ≤ B ≤ 1000000
