Given a string S, and a string T, find the length of the smallest substring of S which contains all the characters of T - in any order. If no such substring exists, print -1.

Input

The first line consists of the string S.
The next line consists of a single integer Q, the number of strings "T" that you would query for in S.
Then follow Q lines, each consisting of a single string T.

 

Output
Q lines, the answers to the Q queries.

Constraints
Should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have. Format it like:

1 <= |S| <= 100000
1 <= Q <= 100

1 <= |T| <= 1000
All characters in the input are lowercase 'a'-'z'.

 

Example
Input:
aabcab
2
ac
d

Output:
