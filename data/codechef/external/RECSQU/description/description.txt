All squares are rectangles.
Given the dimensions a rectangular grid as input, the output is the number of total rectangular subgrids (including the rectangle itself) which are not squares.


Input
The first input should be the number of test cases (t<= 5000). For each test case the input should be two natural numbers (representing rows and columns of the rectangular grid). Each dimension of the rectangular grid can be up to 10000.


Output
For each test case, the output should be the number representing the total number of rectangular subgrids which are not squares.


Example

Input:
