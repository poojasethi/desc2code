Jimmy has a huge quantity of various steel rods of different lengths that he wants to sell. After a long search he was able to find a buyer. But the buyer has kept a condition that all the pieces of rods must be of same length. The buyer will pay as per the market price per unit length for the rods. Now, for making all rods of same length, Jimmy has to cut the rods which will incur him some cost. The pieces of rods that are left over are thrown away. Help Jimmy to make the cuts such that he can maximize the amount of money he earns.
