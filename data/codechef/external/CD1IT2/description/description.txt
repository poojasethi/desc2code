Little Chef is learning differentiation and is amazed by the function e^x as it stays the same even after differentiation.
Just for fun, he tries to find out how large is the value of e^x. He is able to see only 10 digits in his calculator so he wants you to answer his endless list of queries for different values of x.
For each positive integer X that Little Chef gives you, you need to calculate the number of digits before the decimal point in e^X.

Input
The first line contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
In the next T lines, each line has exactly one positive integer X

Output
Output should contain T lines. Print the answer for each X in a separate line.

Constraints

1 <= T <= 10^5
0 <= X <= 10^9


Example

Input
3
1
10
101

Output
1
5
44

Explanation
Test case 1:
The value of e^1 = 2.71828... There is only 1 digit before the decimal point.
Test case 2:
The value of e^10 = 22026.4658... There are 5 digits before the decimal point.
