You are given N integers, denoted by A1, A2,
… , AN
Now you are given Q queries, each of whom is of following two
types:
Type 1: 1 L R: Print the no. of trailing zeros
(zeros in the end) in the multiplication of no.s in range [L,R] of array ‘A’,
i.e. no. of zeros in AL * AL+1 * … * AR
Type 2: 2 L R V: Multiply the all the numbers in
range [L,R] with V. 


Input:
First line contains a single integer T, number of
test cases.
Each test begins with a single line containing 2 space separated integers: N
and Q, the no. of elements in the array and no. of queries.
Next line contains N space-separated integers Ai
Next Q lines describe one query each and can be one of the two
types:
1) “1 L R”: Print no. of trailing zeros in multiplication of all no.s in
range [L,R] of array ‘A’
2) “2 L R V”: Multiply all no.s in range [L,R] with V


Output:
For every test case, print the required answer for each
query of type 2.


Constraints:
1<=T<=10
1<=N<=10^5
1<=Q<=10^5
1<=Ai,V<=2000
1<=L,R<=N


Example:


Input:
1
6 3
15 40 36 4 30 25
1 1 4
2 4 5 25
1 1 4



Output:
2
4



Explanation:
In first query, Multiplication of no.s in range [1,4] =
15*40*36*4 = 86400.
Trailing Zeros in 86400 = 2
In second query, Multiply all no.s in range [4,5] with 25.
Array after multiplication: 15 40 36 100 750 25
In third query, Multiplication of no.s in range [1,4] =
15*40*36*100 = 2160000.
Trailing Zeros in 2160000 = 4
