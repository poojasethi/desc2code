Phileas Fogg and Passepartout are now going on a road trip in their brand new car. They start at location A0 and need to go to AN. Their car has a capacity to hold only C units of fuel and can travel unit distance on unit amount of fuel. They start by filling some amount of fuel from the filling station at A0. On the way, there are several filling stations A1, A2,... AN-1. The cost of fuel is not the same at all filling stations. Find the minimum amount that they have to spend on fuel to make the journey.

Note that it is assured that the journey can be completed with the car of the given capacity.


Input
The first line of input contains T (≤10), the number of test cases. Following this are the descriptions of the testcases
The first line in the description of each test case contains two space integers N (≤50000) and C (≤10^8). This is followed by N lines, each containing an integer. The integer on the ith line is the distance from A0 to Ai and is ≤ 10^8. The distances are in increasing order. This is followed by N more lines, each containing an integer. The integer on the ith line is the cost of one unit of fuel at the filling station Ai-1 and is  ≤ 10^8. 


Output
Output one integer per test case, the minimum total amount that needs to be spent on fuel to complete the journey
