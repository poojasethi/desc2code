Devu is a freshman in the college. In the data structures course, he has recently learned about LCS (longest common subsequence) problem, He thought about this problem a lot and has finally come up with a challenge for you.
You are given a string S of size N consisting only of lowercase English letters ('a' to 'z'). You have to find minimum length of string V also consisting of lowercase English letters('a' to 'z') such that length of LCS (S, V) ≥ L. The string V should not have more than K consecutive equal characters.Note that it is not necessary for string V to be composed of characters of S only.

Input

First line contains T : number of test cases.  
For each test case, You are given two lines. 
First line contains a string S. 
Second line contains two space separated integers K and L.


Output

For each test case, output a single line containing integer corresponding to the answer of the problem.


Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10^6
1 ≤ Size of string S ≤ 10^6
1 ≤  Sum of lengths of strings over all test cases ≤ 10^7 
1 ≤ K, L ≤ Size of S


Example
Input:
2aa1 1aba1 2 Output:
12
Explanation

For first test case, V is 'a'.


For second test case, V can be 'ab' or 'ba'.
