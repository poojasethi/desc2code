Lukas has been filling up a table with N rows and K columns all day long. The rows are numbered from 1 to N, and the columns are numbered from 1 to K. He very quickly filled up the first row and first column with the number m. For all other entries in the table, he decided to use the following formula :

 table[i][j] - table[i-1][j] = table[i][j-1] + table[i-1][j-1]  
where table[i][j] denotes the entry in row i and column j.


It’s night and Lukas wants to sleep but he still hasn’t been able to fill up the table completely. Help him find the value with which he will fill the last entry in the table i.e table[N][K]. Since the value can be very large, give the value mod 1000000007(10^9+7) .


Input
The input consists of a single line containing three space separated integer N,K and m.

Output
 The output should consist of a single integer which is the value of table[N][K] mod 1000000007(10^9+7).  

Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 10^9
1 ≤ K ≤ 5
1 ≤ m ≤ 1000000006


Example
Input:
2 5 6

Output:
54
