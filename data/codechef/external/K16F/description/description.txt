Ashvant is a cool guy with lot of girlfriends. Since valentines day is nearing he wishes to visit one of his girlfriends 
who is currently at a different city. So he decides to travel by bus and in meantime he was thinking about gifting her. He 
thought of gifting something unique. He had THREE types of very rare stones(type1, type2, type3). He had many stones in 
each type. These are very rare stones and his girlfriend really likes these kind of gifts :P
So he decides to make RINGS with these stones placing them at the centre of the ring. He makes rings based on the following conditions
1) three stones of type1 makes the center of the ring
2) three stones of type2 makes the center of the ring
3) three stones of type3 makes the center of the ring
4) a stone from type1, a stone from type2 and a stone from type3 makes the center of the ring(i.e single stone from each 
type gives 3 stones in total which makes the center of the ring)
No other combinations will be considered for making the center of the ring.
Ashvant is very busy so he asks you to make the maximum number of rings from these three types of stones given to you.
