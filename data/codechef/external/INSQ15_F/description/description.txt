Cars of future no longer need fuel to run, but they are fitted with special engines which can only operate in one of the two modes at a time ,either go up the road, or go down the road.

There are N towns in country. i^th town is at height H[i] (1 ≤ i ≤ N) above the sea level.

Changing mode of the car requires permissions from mayor of the town you are currently at. Mayor of i^th town charges amount C[i] (1 ≤ i ≤ n) for giving permission to change mode of the car.

These N towns are connected by R bidirectional roads. Initially no mode is set, so you need permissions to set a mode.

You have to travel from town 1 to N, in minimum amount of cost. Print minimum money required to make the travel. If it is impossible print -1.

Note:


Go up the road mode: when you are at town A and want to go to town B, where H[A] <= H[B]
Go down the road mode: when you are at town A and want to go to town B, where H[A] ≥ H[B]
If you continue with the same mode, you do not need to take permissions from mayor.

 

Input

First line contains two space separated integer N and R, number of towns and number of roads.
Next line contains N space separated integer where i^th integer is H[i], height of i^th town.
Next line contains N space separated integer where i^th integer is C[i], cost charged by mayor of i^th town to give permission for changing the mode.
Next R lines contains two space separated integer u and v, specifying there is a bidirectional road between town u and v.

 

Output
Print minimum cost required for travel. If it is impossible print -1.

Constraints

2 ≤ N ≤ 100000
1 ≤ R ≤ 500000
1 ≤ H[i] ≤ 10^9
1 ≤ C[i] ≤ 10^9

Explanation
There are two paths from 1 - 6 
P1: (1, 2, 3, 6) 
You need to pay $1 to mayor of town 1 to chose down mode. (H[1] ≥ H[2])
You need to pay $1 to mayor of town 2 to chose up mode. (H[2] <= H[3])
You need to pay $1 to mayor of town 3 to chose down mode. (H[3] ≥ H[6])
Total cost = $3
P2: (1, 4, 5, 6) 
You need to pay $1 to mayor of town 1 to chose up mode. (H[1] <= H[4])
You continue with the previous up mode. (H[4] <= H[5])
You need to pay $1 to mayor of town 5 to chose down mode. (H[5] ≥ H[6])
Total cost = $2
So minimum money required is $2.
