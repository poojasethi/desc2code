 
Problem description.
Ajinkya  is a sincere and a punctual student. He always wants to reach the lecture hall well before the scheduled class timings. As the distance between the hostel and lecture hall is too long , he travels using a bicycle. He likes to ride straight and doesn’t like to turn the bicycle as it reduces his speed, so he always chooses  a path which has the least number of turns from hostel to lecture hall. The college is a modeled as   R X C  grid of points (1<=R,C<=100). It consists of roads which are depicted by   “.” and  bushes  are depicted by  “ *”. Obviously Ajinkya  can’t ride through the bushes and only has to take the roads. The hostel is denoted by “H” and lecture hall is denoted by “L”.  Help  Ajinkya  to choose a path to minimize the number of turns.
