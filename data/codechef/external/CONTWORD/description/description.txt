Aman loves solving English puzzles. His teacher taught him a new topic today called Contiguous Words.
A contiguous word is a word in which all the occurrences of each letter of the word is together (i.e. no same letter should be separated by one or more other letters). For example,
"aaabb" and "abc" are contiguous word.
"bitotsav" is not a contiguous word since the 't's don't occur together.
For the weekends the teacher gave Aman a homework on contiguous word. The homework is as follows:
The teacher divided contiguous word into several parts. Aman has to form the original contiguous word and print it. If more than one contiguous word can be formed print "MORE THAN ONE". If a contiguous word cannot be formed from the given parts print "NOT POSSIBLE" (all quotes for clarity).
Input Specification

Each test case contains two lines of input. The first line contains the no. of parts K. The second line contains K strings separated by a single space, denoting parts.


Output Specification

If only one contiguous word can be formed print the word.
If many such words can be formed print "MORE THAN ONE".
If no such contiguous word can be formed print "NOT POSSIBLE".


Constraints
