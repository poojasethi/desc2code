Rahul Dravid may have gone into retirement but his job of facing the bouncers isn't over yet . Only this time , it is his son who is delivering them in the form of mathematical queries . One such query is finding the nth term of the series given by
		f(n) = f(n-2) + f(n-3) + n*2 
your task is to help Dravid solve the query , given f(0)=0 , f(1)=1 , f(2)=1 

Input
first line denotes the number of test cases TT lines follow each containing a number  n  

Output
Output T lines, one for each test case, containing the required answer.As the number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10000003.

Constraints
1< t <=1000
	1< n <=10^9

Example
Input:
