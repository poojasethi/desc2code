The country of Byteland has  N  cities. There are roads across certain pair of cities. There are exactly N-1 such roads. The roads are such that it is possible to go from any city to any other city using those N-1 roads.

One day Little chef and his brother Big chef decided to have a car race. Choosing the starting city and destination city was a big problem. Finally they settled with the following plan:

The starting point (source) of the race will be selected randomly and uniformly among the  N  cities.
Destination point will be selected such that it is farthest from the source so as to have fair chance for both to show their talent !

Little chef is wondering about what will be the expected distance to be traveled during the race ? He is seeking your help. Can you help him out ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of cities in Byteland. Next N-1 lines each contains two space-separated integers u and v. Denoting that there is a road connecting city u and city v. The distance between them is 1.


Output

For each test case, output a single line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. That is the expected distance of the race.
Your answer will be considered correct within absolute or relative error of 10^-6. 


Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ N ≤ 200,000
Input will be such that it is possible to go from any city to any other city using the given roads.


Example
Input:
1
6
1 2
2 3
3 4
3 6
2 5

Output:
2.66666666667


Explanation
Since the source city is selected at uniform and randomly, probability of selection of each city is 1/6. Hence, the answer will be the sum of "distance of the farthest city" from each node multiplied by 1/6.

Warning : Large Input, be careful while reading Input !
