Siyara is given an integer array N. Her friend Vatsal gives her 3 types of queries as follows:

Type 1: 1 M To add a number M in the array at any position
Type 2: 2 M To delete all occurrences of M from the array. If it is not possible, then ignore the query.
Type 3: 3 0 Display the sum of the greatest and second greatest number (other than the greatest) from the array. If not possible, print -1. 

Since the numbers are huge, you have to help Siyara solve the problem as quickly as possible.

Input

The first line contains two space separated integers, T and N where T is the number of queries and N is the number of elements in the array.
Next line contains N space separated array elements.
T lines follow where each line has contains 2 integers. First denoting the type of query: 1, 2 or 3 and the second integer specifying the description provided above.


Output

Only Type 3 queries should be printed, each on a new line.


Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ N ≤ 1000
-10^9 ≤ N[i], M ≤ 10^9

 

Example
Input:
6 6
1 2 2 2 3 4
1 2
2 3
3 0
2 2
2 4
3 0

Output:
6
-1

Explanation
After executing the first query the array becomes {1,2,2,2,3,4,2}, after the second query {1,2,2,2,2,4}, after the third query {4+2}=6, after the fourth query {1,4}, after the fifth query {1}, thus after the sixth query -1.
