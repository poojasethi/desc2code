Chimp has bought N blocks each with a specific height(h1,h2,h3,….hn) for workout. 
Let x1,x2,…….xn be an ordering of blocks where xi represents the height of blocks . 
A workout is consists of N jumps, the first jump is from ground to x1, then from x1 to x2, x2 to x3 and so on till we reach xn. Difficulty of workout is defined as sum of heights of all jumps. Height of a jump is defined as |xi – xi-1| when you jump from xi-1to xi.
More specifically, difficulty of a workout is defined as  summation of   |xi – xi-1| for all i (1 <= i <= N) .
Since chimp starts from ground, x0 = 0
Now he is interested in finding the maximum and minimum difficulty of workout he can achieve by reordering the blocks. Help Chimp find this answer.


Input

The first line consists of an integer T indicating no. of test cases. T test cases follow.
For each test case, 
First line contains an integer N, the no. of blocks. 
Next line contains N numbers indicating height hi of each block.

Output

Output 2 space separated numbers, the maximum and minimum difficulty that can be obtained.


Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 50 
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^3
1 ≤ hi ≤ 10^4
