 
Non-Carry sum of two integers is defined as the sum which is obtained when the numbers are added in a fashion in which the carry obtained while previous sum calculation is dropped. For example the Non-Carry sum of 5625 and 8924 is 3549.

					5625
				+	8924
			     	       _____
				   	3549
as the carry obtained by adding 6 and 9 at the hundreds place is ignored, so is the carry obtained at thousands place is ignored.
Given an array of N integers, A1, A2 ... AN. Find out the Non-Carry sum of two numbers Ai and Aj such that the Non-Carry sum is maximum and i is not equal to j.
 

Input
First line contains a single integer N, the number of elements in the array
Next line contains N spaced integers, the elements in the array.
 

Output
Output a single integer which contains the maximum non-carry sum thus obtained
 

Constraints
2 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ elements of array < 10^9
Time limit: 2s
 

Example
Input:
5
34 56 83 19 38

Output:
92
