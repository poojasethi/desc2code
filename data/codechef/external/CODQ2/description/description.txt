The King of Holumba Island has devised a coin system for exchange of goods and trade among the people. There are 4 coins provided by the king. The coins are of the value Rs. 1, Rs. 2, Rs. 3, and Rs. 5. Devise a coin calculator which finds out the number of coins required to compute an amount of money, such that a least amount of coins are needed. When there is more than one solution, the output should be such that the coins with more value are given preference.    

Input
The amount to compute (say i)

Output
The output should be in 4 lines ,as shown below(refer example if any confusion)  :

a = number of Rs. 5 coins
b = number of Rs. 3 coins 
c = number of Rs. 2 coins
d = number of Rs. 1 coins


Constraints
Input i
   0<=i<=1000

Example

Input12Output2010
Input24Output4101


Explanation
For input
24
24 = (4 X Rs. 5) + (1 X Rs. 3) + (0 X Rs. 2) + (1 X Rs. 1)
