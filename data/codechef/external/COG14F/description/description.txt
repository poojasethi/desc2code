 

All Oscar awards are numbered from 1 to N and arranged in a tree rooted at 1.Each nth Oscar has some integral value v. We can perform k queries on the given tree of following type.
a)1 n u change the value of nth Oscar to u where u is an integer.
b)2 n c print the product of the sub-tree of  nth  oscar and take it’s modulo with c.
 

Input
First line contains N (number of nodes)  and k(number of queries)
Next line contains N numbers,each ith  number denoting the value of node(v) in the tree
Next N-1 lines describe the connections of the tree i.e in each line, a b represents that node a and node b are connected.
Next k lines contain the above given queries.

Output
Output description.
