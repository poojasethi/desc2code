 


Problem description.
The Fibonacci sequence is defined as 
g(n) = g(n-1) + g(n-2).
But this is Fibonacci with a twist.
A curious student thought of changing it to 
f(n) = f(n-1) + 2*f(n-2).
with f(1) = 1 and f(2) = 5
He made up few terms(initial given) but then he had to complete other assignments.
So now he wants your help.
Given t test cases with each n print out f(n) mod 10000007. 

Input
First line contains an interger T the number of test cases.
Each test case contain a single integer N.

Output
A single integer answer in a line for each test case.

Constraints

0 ≤ T ≤  100 
1 ≤ N ≤  10^9
