The expected output of the following C program is to print the elements in the array. But when actually run, it doesn't do so.
Code:
  #include<stdio.h>            
  #define dummy (sizeof(temp) / sizeof(2[temp]))
 
 int temp[]  {1,2,3,4};
 int main()   { int d;
 //Block 1 Starts here
 for(d1;d <= (dummy-2);d++)  //Line 1  //Block 1 Ends here
          printf("%d\n",temp[d+1]);          
 return 0;                                              
  }

Expected Output:1
2
3
4
Rules:
1)    U can make changes in Block 1 only.
2)    In final program no. of lines in Block 1 should not exceed 2.
