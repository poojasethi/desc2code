Ali knows how to count, but he is now learning how to 
            write numbers. As he is a very good student, he already learned 1, 2, 3 and 4. 
            But he did not realize yet that 4 is different from 1, so he thinks that 4 is 
            another way to write 1. Besides that, he is having fun with a little game he 
            created himself: he make numbers (with those four digits) and sum their values. 
            For instance: 


132 = 1 + 3 + 2 = 6 


112314 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 9 


(Remember that Ali thinks that 4 = 1) 


  


After making a lot of numbers in this way, Ali now 
            wants to know how much numbers he can create such that their sum is a number n. 
            For instance, for n=2 he noticed that he can make 5 numbers: 11, 14, 41, 44 and 
            2 (he knows how to count them up, but he does not know how to write five). 
            However, he cannot figure it out for n greater that 2. So, he asked you to help 
            him. 


  


Input: 


Input will consist on an arbitrary number of sets. 
            Each set will consist on an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 1000. You must read 
            until you reach the end of file. 


  


Output: 


For each number read, you must output another number 
            (on a line alone) stating how much numbers Ali can make such that the sum of 
            their digits is equal to the given number.
