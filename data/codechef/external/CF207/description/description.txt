You are given a number g. Find a sequence S of length n which satisfies the following condition: 

1)GCD ( S0, S1, S2, .... ,Si, ..... ,Sn-1 ) = g.
2)Si > g, ∀ 0 ≤ i < n.
3)Si ≥ Sj, ∀ j ≤ i

Define a function, sum(S) = S0 + S1 + .... + Sn-1. 
If multiple sequences satisfy first three properties, print the one which minimizes sum(S) function.

Note: ∀ means for all values of

Input
The first line will contain T, the number of test cases. Next T lines follow. The ith line will contain two space separated integers, g and n, for the ith test case..

Output
For each test case, print a line containing n space separated integers of sequence S.

Constraints
