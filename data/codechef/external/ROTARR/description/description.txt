Raj likes competitve programming very much and he was the problem setter of the coding contest in his college. He always liked to give a storyline to the questions he prepared. This time he had a very good question but he couldn't think of any storyline for that question. So he directly gave the question as:You are given an array of size n. All the elements of the array are from 0 to n-1 (inclusive). There are two different types of operations defined on the array.


1 l r x : modify ai = (ai+x) mod n for all l ≤ i ≤ r
2 l r x : print the number of indices i such that ai = x  for all l ≤ i ≤ r

Now you are given a lot of queries of type 1 and type 2. Print the answer to each query of the second type.

Input Description

The first line contain n and q, number of elements in the array and total number of queries to perform.
Next line contains n values, elements of array A (initially).
Next q lines contain queries of type 1 or type 2


Output Description
For every query of second type, print the required answer.

Constraints
1 ≤ n,q ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ Ai ≤ n-1
0 ≤ l ≤ n-1, l ≤ r ≤ n-1, 0 ≤ x ≤ n-1
