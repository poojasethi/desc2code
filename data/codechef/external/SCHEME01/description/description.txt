Ishant goes to Houston to spend his vacations. The city of Houston has a rather strange transportation system for the public. They have devised a system of points based on which they decide how much fare a person has to pay to use the transportation. 
When a person starts he has 0 points. There are various stops along any path and it is mandatory to stop at those stops. When he is travelling between those stops his points are increased according to the distance he travels . When a person stops at a stop, a certain number of points are decreased. The condition for the points to be decreased at a stop is that the number of points increased while travelling from the previous stop to the present stop should be strictly more than the points which need to be reduced at the current stop. If this is not true, the points aren’t reduced. When the person reaches the destination (which is also considered as a stop) he is charged an amount equal to 10 times the points he possesses.
As there are multiple paths between any 2 stops, Ishant wants you to devise a way to figure out the minimum amount of money he would have to pay in order to travel between 2 stops.

Input
The first line contains a single integer T, 
the number of test cases. T test cases 
follow. The first line of a test case contains two integers N and M, separated by a space indicating respectively the number of stops and the existing one way routes in the city.
Next M lines contain 3 integars each as "l r C" :Where l and r represent stop number and C  represents the distance between them. Next N lines contain a single integar P which represents the number of points decreased at each stop from  1 to N respectively. Last line of each test case contains two integers S and D separated by a single space ,indicating respectively the starting and the destination stops.

Output
For every test case, you need to output the minimum amount of money that Ishant will have to pay to travel between the 2 stops. 
Print “-1” (quotes for clarification),if there doesn’t exist a path between the 2 stops.


Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ N,l,r ≤ 1000
1 ≤ M ≤ 100000
1 ≤ C ≤ 10000
1 ≤ P ≤ 1000


Example
Input:

5 4
1 2 8
2 3 6
3 4 4
4 5 3
1
3
6
7
2
1 5

Output:
160

Note: No points are deducted at the starting stop.
