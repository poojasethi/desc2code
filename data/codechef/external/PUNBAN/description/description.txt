He starts eating at speed 1 banana/second. He can increase or decrease speed of eating by one only. The condition is that he must end eating at speed 1 banana/second. So, your task is to find minimum time required to finish all bananas in a dish.
 

Input
First line contain number of test cases T. Next T lines contain one integer N. Where N is number of bananas in a dish.

Output
For each test case print minimum time require to eat all N bananas.
 

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5

 

Example
Input:
2
2
4

Output:
2
3

 

Explanation
Example case 1.Dave will start to eat with rate of 1 banana/second. Then only one banana will remain. He will eat that banana in 1 second. Thus, Total time is 2 seconds.
Example case 2.Dave starts with rate of 1 banana/second, and then increase it to 2 bananas/second and again decrease it to 1 banana/second. So total time is 3 seconds.
