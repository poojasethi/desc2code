 

      You are given a tree with N vertices rooted at 1. You consider all the N subtrees (rooted at 1,2..N such that subtree rooted at i consists of i and all nodes which contain i as an ancestor).
      Each node in the graph also consists of a color. The colors can be between 1 to K. 
      For each subtree find the no. of distinct colours in that subtree. 
      Output the sum of all these N numbers.

 

Input

    First line of input contains 2 integers N,K.
    Next N-1 lines (from line 2 to line N) contain 1 integer each. (i + 1) ^th line contains the parent of i+2 and is guaranteed to be lesser than i+2. 1 is the root of the tree. 
    Next line contains N integers , each from 1 to K representing the colors of each node. 


Output
 Single integer corresponding to the required answer. 

Constraints
 1 <= N <= 10^5 
 1 <= K <= 10^5 
 

Example
Input:
3 4
1
1
1 2 3

Output:
5
 

Explanation

The 3 subtrees are [1,2,3] , [2], [3] , which have 3,1,1 distinct colours respectively. So the answer is 5.
