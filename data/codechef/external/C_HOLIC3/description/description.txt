 
Chef is long overdue for his laundry and is trying to figure out how to use a washing machine. He asks his friend Raseac to help him. Raseac loves riddles though. He accepts to help the chef out but asks him to solve or decode his riddle before he assists in the operation of the washing machine.
He said:
 I came, I saw, I conquered methinks is 'gagtgbgtglct'. [venividivici==gagtgbgtglct]
So tell me my dear Chef, what you think about my other riddles?
