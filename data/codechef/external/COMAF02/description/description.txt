 
The Lannister family owes a lot of money to the Iron Bank of Braavos. There are N members in the Lannister family and each one of them has a special safety deposit box in the Iron Bank of Braavos. This special safety deposit account can only contain coins and the coins in these deposit boxes can only be tripled or multiplied 5 times.
The Iron Bank of Braavos made a special announcement to encourage people to open more such deposit boxes. The bank officials said, “If all the members of a particular family have a special safety deposit box in the Iron Bank of Braavos and if the money contained in all those boxes ever becomes equal, then all the debts of that family will be freed.”
Hearing this announcement, the Lannister family got together and hired Varys to figure out if it was possible for the Lannister family to become debt free from the Iron Bank of Braavos. Varys is not good at math, so help him figure out if it is possible for the Lannister family to become debt-free.
