Sumit is participating in ANK’s flagship event Terrorist Takedown. After chasing the terrorist around the campus, he discovers that the terrorist is hiding in the Academic Building. To catch the terrorist he has to climb a lot of stairs. He is already tired and so wants to spend minimum amount of energy in climbing the stairs. There are ‘n’ steps and each step has a different height. Sumit can jump upto 3 steps at a time and can make a jump of height upto 10 units. The amount of energy used to make a jump of height ‘i’ is denoted by E[i], find the minimum amount of energy Sumit needs to spend to get hold of the terrorist.

Input
First line contains T, the number of test cases. 3T lines follow. First line of each test case contains n, the number of steps Sumit has to climb. Second line contains ‘n’ space separated integers denoting the height of each step. The third line contains 10 space separated integers forming the array E.

Output
Output T lines. Each line displays the minimum amount of energy Sumit has to spend in order to catch the terrorist.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ Height of each step ≤ 10
1 ≤ E[i] ≤ 1000


Example
Input:
2
5
2 1 4 3 2
1 2 3 3 5 7 8 9 10 15
4
2 4 3 10
2 4 5 7 8 10 11 14 14 19


Output:
11
33



Explanation
Example case 1. He takes steps of size 1 each time. 2+1+3+3+2=11
Example case 2. He takes steps of size 3 and 1. 14+19=33
