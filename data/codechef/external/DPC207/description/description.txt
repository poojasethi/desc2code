When 
        displaying a collection of rectangular windows, a critical step is determining 
        whether two windows overlap, and, if so, where on the screen the overlapping 
        region lies. Write a program to perform this function. Your program will accept 
        as input the coordinates of two rectangular windows. If the windows do not 
        overlap, your program should produce a message to the effect. If they do 
        overlap, you should compute the coordinates of the overlapping region (which 
        must itself be a rectangle).

         

 
        All coordinates are expressed in "pixel numbers", integer values ranging 
        from 0 to 9999. A rectangle will be described by two pairs of (X, Y) 
        coordinates. The first pair gives the coordinates of the lower left hand corner 
        (XLL, YLL). The second pair gives the coordinates of the upper right hand 
        coordinates (XUR, YUR). You are guaranteed that XLL<XUR and YLL<YUR.

 


 Input


         
        

         
        
The first line will have a 
        number N (0<N<=100) with the number of test cases. Each test case will consists 
        of two lines each containing four numbers. The first line contains the integer 
        numbers XLL, YLL, XUR and YUR for the first window. The second contains the same 
        numbers for the second window.

 



        Output


        For each test case, if the two window do no overlap, print the 
        



        Message "No Overlap". If the two windows do overlap, print 4 integer numbers 
        giving the XLL, YLL, XUR and YUR for the region of overlap.  Note that two windows that share a 
        common edge but have no other point in common are considered to have "No 
        Overlap".
