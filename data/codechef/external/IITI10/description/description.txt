Recently, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry has introduced a course on coumputer programming! As a result, many programming duels now take place in Hogwarts. Lucius Malfoy has challenged Harry Potter to one such programming duel. 

The rules of the duel are as follows:
1) Malfoy chooses two integers N(>0) and K( â‰¥ 0) and a sequence S of N positive integers.
2) Harry must find the number of distinct non-empty subsequences L of S such that no two integers in L have an absolute difference greater than K.
Since this number may be very large, Harry must report this number modulo (10^9+7).

Input
Input will begin with an integer T, the total number of test cases. Description of T test cases follows.
Each test case is described by two lines of input.
The first line of each test case will consist of two space-seperated integers : N,K.
The second line will contain N space seperated integers : S[1],S[2], ... S[N].

Output
For each test case output a single integer : The number that Harry must report to Malfoy.

Constraints
1 <= T <=5
1 <= N <= 10^5
0 <= K <= 10^9
1 <= S[i] <=10^9

Example
Input:

2
3 1
10 11 12
5 6
12 27 1 13 14

Output:

5
9


Explanation
CASE 1 : Possible subsequences : (10), (11), (12), (10,11), (11,12).
CASE 2 : Possible subsequences : (12), (27), (1), (13), (14), (12,13), (12,14), (13,14), (12,13,14).
