Piyush learnt bitwise-operation recently. He got very fascinated about bitwise-operation for its wonderful uses. But his girlfriend is not sure of that he has enough skills to solve bitwise-operation problem. So, she decides to test his skills by giving a problem. She gave N non-negative integers A1, A2,...AN, and asks him to find the pair of integers such that AND operation on that pair of integers is maximum.
AND is a bit-wise operation which is corresponding to & in C++ and Java.


Input


The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.


The first line of each test case contains a single integer N. The next line contains N numbers denoting the Ai.


Output
Print a single integer which is the largest value of Ax AND Ay where 1 ≤ x < y ≤ N.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤  100 
2 ≤ N ≤  10^5 
0 ≤ Ai ≤  10^9 


Example
Input:
1
5
2 3 4 5 8

Output:
4
