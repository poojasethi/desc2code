Lucky has found a problem in her book. A room has N (1 to N inclusive) bulbs and N switches. N people go in one by one. 1st person goes in and toggles none of the switches. 2nd person goes in and toggles all switches other than the multiples of 2(2, 4, 6...). 3rd person goes in and toggles all switches other than multiples of 3(3, 6, 9...), and so on (Till Nth person toggles all the switches except Nth switch). Once the process is finished, how many bulbs are in 'on' state. (Assume that all bulbs to be in 'off' state initially).

Help Here to solve the problem.

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denotes number of bulbs and number of persons. 


Output


    For each test case, output a single line containing that how many bulbs are in on state.



Constraints
Should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have. Format it like:

1 ≤ T ≤ 100000
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^9  


Example
Input:
