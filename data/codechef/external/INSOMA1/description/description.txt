Despite indications to the contrary, India too has had its share of UFOs. There is enormous debate in UFO circles about the veracity of sightings of UFOs in the Aksai Chin area near Kashmir.  A naughty local wanted to play truant and decided to set up a fake UFO base. To generate interest, he decided to draw square number patterns on the ground. The general pattern of the square was as follows:

   1   2   3   4   5    6   7  8
28 29 48 47 46 45 44  9
27 30 49 50 51 52 43 10
26 31 60 61 64 53 42 11
25 32 59 62 63 54 41 12
24 33 58 57 56 55 40 13
23 34 35 36 37 38 39 14
22 21 20 19 18 17 16 15


You need to write a program to generate such a square for a given input N.


Input
N = the size of the side of a square you should generate

Output
An NxN square according to the rules described above

Example

Input:
8

Output:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
28 29 48 47 46 45 44 9
27 30 49 50 51 52 43 10
26 31 60 61 64 53 42 11
25 32 59 62 63 54 41 12
24 33 58 57 56 55 40 13
23 34 35 36 37 38 39 14
22 21 20 19 18 17 16 15
