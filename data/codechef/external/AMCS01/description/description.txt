Chef has a problem with the new city he has invented. The city has N buildings and there are bridges which connect some pair of buildings in such a way that there is exactly one path between any pair of buildings. (i.e. They form a tree). All bridges are of equal length. Distance between two buildings is the sum of lengths all bridges connecting the two buildings. Now chef wants to find for each building i, the number of buildings that are farthest from it.

Input format 
 First line contains an integer N.
 Next N - 1 lines contains 2 integers each. i+1^th line contains ui and vi which means that there is a bridge between  ui and vi 

 Output format 
 Print N integers seperated by a space in a single line denoting the answer for each building

Constraints

 2 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
 0 ≤ ui , vi &lt N for all i from 1 to N - 1


 Example 
 Input 
4 
0 1
1 2
1 3
 Output 
2 3 2 2

 Explanation 
2 and 3 are farthest from 0 (both at a distance of 2 bridges). So there are 2 of them and hence first number is 2.
0,2 and 3 are farthest from 1. So the next number is 3.
Similarly for 2 and 3.
