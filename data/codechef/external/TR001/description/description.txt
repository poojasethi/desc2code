Problem Statement:
Chef Diablo is very good at making Modaks(an Indian sweet). He also loves to eat them. He makes many Modaks everyday and delivers it to various customers. Today he has done the same, but 1 Modak went unsold. He was very happy seeing this as he could have it. Before having it he decided to go and wash his hands(he takes a long time to wash his hands...:P). In the mean while Chef Gunner enters his shop. He is a very good friend of Chef Diablo. He sees the Modak in the plate and decides to hide it so that Chef Diablo finds some difficulty in finding the Modak. So he makes a n*m matrix of boxes and hides the Modak in one of the boxes. The number of boxes can be very large i.e., 1<=n,m<=10^19. As they are good friends and Chef Gunner does not want to put their friendship in danger he leaves clues in every box that mention the direction, i.e. if Chef Diablo opens any box he can see where the Modak is placed relative to that box.
Total 8 types of clues can be present:

 Exactly Above it 
 Exactly Below it 
 Exactly To the Right 
 Exactly To the Left 
 In the Top Right Region 
 In the Bottom Right Region 
 In the Top Left Region 
 In the Bottom Left Region 


After he sets this up, Chef Diablo enters and sees a large number of boxes with a note saying:


Modak in one of the Boxes...find it if u can...HAHAHAHA...:P


-V. Gunner.


Seeing the number of boxes he turns to you for help. Please tell him the minimum number of boxes he would have to open in the worst case scenario to infer the position of the box that contains Modak.
