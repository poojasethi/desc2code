 
You are given two integers, N and M, and two bit positions, i and j. Write a method to replace all bits between i and j in the binary value of N with binary of M (e.g., M becomes a substring of
N located at i and starting at j).

Input
Input consists of two lines

The first line  consists of two integers N and M
The second line consists of Bit positions(integers) i and j


Output
For each input output a single line containing the integer N after replacing i to j bits of binary value of N by binary value of M

Example
Input:
1024 21
2 6

Output:
1108
 

Explanation

1024 => 10000000000
21 => 10101
1108 => 10001010100

Note:LSB is the rightmost bit
