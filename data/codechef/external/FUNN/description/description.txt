Problem
Duda is very funny guy in UVCE and recently he found a new kind of numbers.
He calls those numbers as funny numbers. Duda says that funny number is numbers which has prime number of prime factors.
For Example : prime factors of number 6 are 3 and 2, so 6 has 2 prime factors and 2 is a prime number, so 6 is a funny number.
similarly prime factors of number 8 is 2, so 8 has only one prime number, hence 8 is not funny number.
Now Duda wants to have some fun with his juniors and gives them a number N and
asks them to identify whether the number is funny or not.
Write program to determine whether the given number is funny or not and have fun with Duda.

Input
First line of input contains T, number of testcases.
Each testcase contains single line containing integer N, number of given by Duda.

Output
For each testcase print "Funny"(without quotes) if the number given in that testcase is Funny,
else print "Not Funny" in each line.

Constraints
