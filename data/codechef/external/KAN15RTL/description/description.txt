Define function F on set of positive integers as

A positive integer n is called an "identity integer" if F(n) = {n}. Given multiple queries,
each consisting of a single integer K, find the K^th "identity integer".

Input

First line contains a single integer Q, denoting the number of queries.
Q lines follow, each containing a single integer K.


Output

For each query, print a single integer, the K^th "identity integer" modulo 1000000007.


Constraints

1 ≤ Q, K ≤ 200000
