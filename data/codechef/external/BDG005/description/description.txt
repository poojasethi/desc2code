Problem description.
Mimi loves chocolate, a lot actually. She eats lots of them every day. But due to excessive chocolate-eating, her doctor advised to restrict the intake of chocolate. But as she is addicted to chocolate, she cannot control it suddenly. So, she decides to play a game for quitting chocolate.
On each day, if the number of chocolates is even, she will eat half of the chocolates. If it is odd, she brings more chocolates such that the new number of chocolates is thrice the current number of chocolates plus three. If the number of chocolates left is 1 on any day, then Mimi will leave eating chocolate permanently.

Will Mimi be still eating chocolate on 29th January, 2113? 

Input

The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow.
Each test case, contain an integer N, the number of chocolates.



Rules

Bugs will be mainly logical errors, including overflow issues. It will not be syntax-oriented or language-specific.
Since, it is an debugging contest, you will be provided a bugged solution below the Constraints section.Please, see that you must adhere to the problem code provided, make changes only where necessary.

Online participants can copy the code and compile it using an online compiler (Eg. codechef.com/ide).

Onsite participants will be provided Codeblocks with gcc compiler, since NO internet access other than CodeChef website will be provided.

Once the bugs are eliminated from the code, the clean code should be submitted by using the "Submit" button on the top-right corner.

Participants will be penalised for changing the entire problem solution or writing their own solution,completely different from the buggy code as provided in the problem statement as our main intention is to test the debugging abilities of the participants.



Output
Output T lines, each line containing "Yes" or "No" whether or not she will be eating chocolates after 29th January, 2113.
