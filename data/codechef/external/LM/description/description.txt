This valentine day,a rose-shopkeeper prayed to god to give him some magical power such that he could earn a lot
of money.God listened to him & agreed to give him LOVE-MAGIC.But God mentioned some conditions which the
shop-keeper would have to follow to learn that MAGIC.
CONDITIONS:
1.God will give him the ‘n’ roses to sell & the shop-keeper is’nt allow to sell any extra roses.
2.He has to provide each of his customer an id number.The 1st customer will have the id 1,2nd will have 2
& so on upto ‘n’ & he isn’t allowed to sell roses to a customer who doesn’t have any id.So he can only sell to ‘n’
customers.
If the shop-keeper agreed to fulfilled these conditions then God will help him with the MAGIC.The
functionalities of the MAGIC are:
1.The ith id customer will surely buy i number of roses.
2.after selling roses to kth id customer, the shop-keeper will be amazed to see that ‘k’ number of roses
added to his stock.
3.The ith id customer will surely pay the amount equals to, the square of the number of ways he can
choose those ‘i’ roses from the stock multiplied by that customer’s id number.
4.This magic will work for each ‘i’ & ‘k’ where 1 ≤ i,k ≤ n;
NOTE: Each customer can buy only once & then his id will be invalid & at any instance of time in the stock the
shop-keeper will have all the roses distinct from each other.
CONSTRAINT:
1 ≤ T ≤ 1000;
1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6;

Input
Suppose that day the shop-keeper fulfilled the conditions & the magic works & he able to sell to all the ‘n’
customers.Now,first line of the input an integer ‘T’ will be given indicating the number of test case.Then in
following ‘T’ lines,each contains an integer which is the value of ‘n’.

Output
For each test case You have to say how much amount the shop-keeper earns that day.Mind it the output
will be a huge number so give your answer in modulo (10^9+7),Separate each answer corresponds to each test
case with a new line character.
