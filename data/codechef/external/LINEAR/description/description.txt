Viral is playing marbles with his friends.
While playing, he accidentally drops N marbles and the marbles are spread on the floor and stopped. Viral notes the position X,Y of the marbles as if the floor were coordinate system and marbles as points.
Viral has to pick up the marbles, but Viral is lazy so he wants to decide a line connecting maximum number of marbles.
Help Viral find the maximum number of marbles that lie in a line. If two lines have same number of marbles, print number of marbles on any one of them.

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of points. The second line contains N space-separated integers X and Y denoting the co-ordinates of the points at which the marbles stop.


Output

For each test case, output a single line containing the maximum number of marbles in a line.


Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 5000
-100000 ≤ X,Y ≤ 100000
