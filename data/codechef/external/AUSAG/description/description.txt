 
One day Sifat and his mysterious friend went to jungle to had a picnic . They were so involved with their conversation that they lost their way  back to home  .  It was already quiet late and so they decided to find a safe place to spend rest of  the night . They found a cave that was big and clean . They thought it was the best place to wait for dawn and then they could easily find their way  back to home . But Alas it was a cave of Gaint “You know who” . At mid night Gaint , you know who came  back to his cave and caught sifat and his mysterious friend . 
 
  It was Sifat’s good luck or bad luck Gaint “you know who” was vegetarian but didn’t want to lose the chance to play with sifat and his mysterious friend .  Gaint , “you know who” used to be a problem  solver so he told sifat that he would give him a sentence “S” and a word “s” . Sifat had to find how many times word “s” occurs as a substring of “S” ( you can safely omit all spaces from the sentence in order to find the substring occurrence ) .   
 

Input
Input starts with a integer T ( T <= 30 ) , denoting the number of test cases . 
Each case starts with two line . First line contains ‘S’ and second line contains ‘s’ . 

Output
For each case first print case number and then print number of times s occurs as a substring in S after removing all spaces from S . 

Constraints

1 <= T <=  30
1 <=  length(S)  <=  100000 
1 <=  length(s)  <=  length(S) 


Example
Input:
4
axb ycz d
abc
ab  cab cabc abc
abc
aab acbaa bbaaz
aab
aaaaaa
aa


Output: 

Case 1: 0
