In an ants' colony spread over a flat surface, the ants can reside at integral coordinates as close as unit distance apart from each other (but no closer). The colony has the shape of a quadrilateral ABCD where one ant must reside at each of A, B, C, and D, and all other ants can be on any integral coordinate on its perimeter and its interior. Given the integral positions of A, B, C, and D, print the maximum number of ants that can reside in the colony (including the ants that can reside on the four corners and the perimeter).

Input
The first line contains the number of test cases, N.
For each test case, a single line contains the x and y coordinates of the four corners of the quadrilateral in clockwise order starting with the left-most, bottom-most point.

Output
For each test case, print the case number, followed by a colon, followed by a single space, followed by a single integer indicating the maximum number of ants.

Constraints
0 < N ≤ 3
|x|, |y| ≤ 10,000

Example
Input:
2
1 1 3 4 5 3 6 1
1 3 5 6 6 3 3 1

Output:
Case 1: 14
Case 2: 16
