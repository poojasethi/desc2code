You are given a sequence of N integers, a[1], a[2], , , , a[N].  
Find out the maximum possible average value of sub-sequences of array a.


Input

First line of the input contains a single integer T denoting number of test cases


For each test case, first line contains a single integer denoting N, the number of elements of array a. 
Next line contains N space separated integers denoting the array a.


Output

Print T lines each line containing the maximum possible average value. Your answer will be considered correct if it's absolute or relative error is less than 10 ^-6.


Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10 
2 ≤ N ≤ 1000
1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10^5


Example
Input:
1
5
1 3 2 1 3
Output:
3

Explanation
Example case 1. Average value of subsequence 3, 3 is 3. This is the maximum possible average value.
