Given an input sequence. You have to write a program to sort it in non decreasing order.

Input
First line of input T has number of test cases followed by T test cases.
Each test case has two lines. First line has a number N. The second line has N space separated elements as an input sequence

Output
Output has T lines of output corresponding to each test case.
Each line will have space separated integers in non decreasing order.

Example

Input:
3
2
3 4
5
1 4 5 8 2
