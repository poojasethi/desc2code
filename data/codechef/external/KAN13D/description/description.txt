Suppose we have recurrences of the following form, characterized by three parameters m, sigma1..m and f0..m-1, where m > 0 and sigmai is a binary variable (1 <= i <= m).

A sequence of number s can be generated as followings:

if i < m, then si = fi
otherwise, i.e. i â‰¥ m, si = fi - 1 * sigma1 + ... + fi - j * sigmaj + ... + fi - m * sigmam

Given m, n, sigma1..m and f0..m-1, compute sn modulo 10^9 + 7.

Input

First line of input contains a positive interger T, then T testcases follow.

For each testcase, first line contains positive integer m and non-negative integer n
separated by a single space. Second line contains m integers of f0..m-1, separated by single space. Third line contains m numbers of sigma1..m, separated by single space. 

Output
For each testcase, output should contain a single number sn modulo 10^9 +7 followed by a newline.

Constraints
1 <= T <= 20
1 <= m <= 100
0 <= n <= 10^9
-10^9 <= fi <= 10^9
sigmai = 0 or 1

Example
Input:
2
2 100
1 1
1 1
3 10
1 1 1
1 1 1

Output:
782204094
193
