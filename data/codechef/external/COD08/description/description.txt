Cersei And Her Energy Game
Cersei Lannister likes to play difficult games but this Energy Game is little too difficult for her ,so you have to help her out.
There is a one-dimensional road. The road is separated into N consecutive parts. The parts are numbered 0 through N-1, in order. Cersei is going to walk from part 0 to part N-1.
Cersei also noticed that each part of the road has a color: either red, green, or blue. Part 0 is red.
Cersei is going to perform a sequence of steps. Each step must lead in the positive direction. That is, if her current part is i, the next step will take her to one of the parts i+1 through N-1, inclusive. Her steps can be arbitrarily long. However, longer steps are harder: a step of length j costs j*j energy.
Additionally, Cersei wants to step on colors in a specific order: red, green, blue, red, green, blue, ... That is, she starts on the red part 0, makes a step to a green part, from there to a blue part, and so on, always repeating red, green, and blue in a cycle. Note that the final part N-1 also has some color and thus Cersei must reach it in a corresponding step.

INPUT:
First line consist of 't' number of test cases. The next  't' lines, each line has a string representing the road (each string has 'N' elements) . For each i, element i of string is the color of part i: 'R' represents red, 'G' green, and 'B' blue.

CONSTRAINTS:
Following holds for each string in input:

string will contain between 2 and 15 characters, inclusive.
each character of string will be either 'R' or 'G' or 'B'.
The first character of string will be 'R'.
 1<= t <=30


OUTPUT:
If Cersei can reach part N-1 in the way described above, print the smallest possible total cost of doing so. Otherwise, print -1.
