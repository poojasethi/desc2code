Alice is irritating Bob to take her out for dinner. But, Bob is not interested as he has solve this problem given by his boss, Mr. Network. The problem is as follows:
Let F(N) denote the number of factors of N, including 1 and N. Given a number N, Bob needs to find out if the value F(N) = 2 or not.
If Alice can solve the problem, then Bob will take her to dinner. Alice needs your help, help her!

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each of the T lines that follow have the number N for which you've to calculate F(N).

Output
For each test case, print "Yes" if F(N)=2 else print "No".

Constraints

1 <= T <= 10^6
1 <= N <= 10^7


Example
Input:
2
3
10

Output:
Yes
No

Explanation
Example case 1.
For N = 3, F(N) = 2, as the factors of 3 are { 1, 3 }. Hence answer is Yes.
Example case 2.
For N = 10, F(N) = 4, as the factors of 10 are { 1, 2, 5, 10 }. Hence answer is No.
