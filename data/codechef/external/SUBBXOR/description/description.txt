  A straightforward question. Given an array of positive integers you have to
  print the number of subarrays whose XOR is less than K.
  Subarrays are defined as a sequence of continuous elements Ai, Ai+1, ..., Aj .
  XOR of a subarray is defined as Ai^Ai+1^ ... ^Aj.
  Symbol ^ is Exclusive Or. You can read more about it here:
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or


Input Format:

  First line contains T, the number of test cases. Each of the test case
  consists of N and K in one line, followed by N space separated integers in
  next line.
  

Output Format:

  For each test case, print the required answer.
  

Constraints:

  1 ≤ T ≤ 10
  1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
  1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10^5
  1 ≤ K ≤ 10^6
  Sum of N over all testcases will not exceed 10^5.


Sample Input:

1
5 2
4 1 3 2 7	
Sample Output:

3
Explanation:

  Only subarrays satisfying the conditions are [1],[1,3,2] and [3,2].
