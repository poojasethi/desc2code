A function f is defined over natural numbers as:
f(N) = ∑ di μ(di)
Here the summation is over di, all positive integers which are factors of N. 
μ(n) is the Möbius function defined in the following way: If there exists a prime p such that p^2 is a factor of n, then μ(n)=0. Otherwise, if n has an odd number of prime factors, μ(n)=-1. If not, μ(n)=1. Thus the first few values for μ(n) (starting from 1) are 1, -1, -1, 0, -1, 1, -1, 0... 
Given an integer X (0 ≤ X ≤ 10^12), find the smallest natural number N such that |f(N)|>X.

Input
The first line of the input contains T, the number of test cases (T ≤ 1000). Following this are T lines, each containing an integer X (0 ≤ X ≤ 10^12) corresponding to the test case.

Output
For each test case in the input, output the smallest natural number N such that  |f(N)|>X.
