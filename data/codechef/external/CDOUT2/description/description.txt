Sourabh is a very good student, but he does a very weird mistake in multiplication. If he has to multiply two same single digits like 9x9 or 2x2, instead of multiplying the numbers like he is supposed to, he adds them. His teacher gives him two numbers to N and K and tells him to multiply the two numbers and Sourabh does the same mistake again. He then teaches Sourabh the correct process of multiplying and tells him to find the correct answer when N and K is multiplied. He also tells him to find the sum of the correct and wrong answer of the multiplication. As  wants to go out and play, can you please help him to find the answer?

Input
The First line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
Each test case will have two Integers N and K separated by a space.


Output
For each test case output a single integer which is the sum of the correct multiplication and wrong multiplication of N and K.
