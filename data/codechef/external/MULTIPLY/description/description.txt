Arif is very intelligent boy and also good at mathematics. One day his Mathematics Teacher asked him to find the product of two polynomial expressions. As the co-efficients of those polynomials are much larger, he decided to write a code to solve this problem. But, he is not aware of programming. 
Help him to find the product.


Input
Input description.
Line1--m n ---where m-1,n-1 is the degree of 1st and 2nd polynomial respectively 
Line2-- m integers representing co-efficients of 1st polynomial
Line 3-- n integers representing co-efficients of 2nd polynomial


Output
Output description.
Print the final polynomial obtained after product

Clearly observe the example for input and output format 

Constraints
Should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have. Format it like:

-100 ≤ m,n ≤ 100

Example
Input:
4 3
5 0 -20 6        // 5-20x^2+6x^3
1 -2 4                // 1-2x^1+4x^2

Output:
5 + -10x^1 + 0x^2 + 46x^3 + -92x^4 + 24x^5
