The pirates are having a contest. Whoever wins will get Devil Fruit as the prize.
Blackbeard wanted the fruit for himself so he tried to steal the prize. But he was spotted while stealing. So he moved to plan B. He sliced the fruit and mixed it with other normal sliced fruits. Every fruit in that mixture has a unique id.
Being forgetful, Blackbeard forgets the Devil Fruit’s id. But luck being in his favor and he remembered that he sliced the Devil’s Fruit in maximum number of slices.
Given a mixture of numbers representing the fruits, you have to tell which one is the Devil’s Fruit and also the number of slices of the Devil’s Fruit. If there are multiple fruits with maximum number of slices then print the one whose id is maximum.


Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
The following T cases are as follows.
The first line of each test case contains a number N, denoting the total number of slices in the mixture.
The second line of each test case contains N space separated integer Fi's, denoting the fruit’s unique id.


Output
For each test case output two space separated integers I, denoting the id of Devil’s Fruit and S, denoting the number of slices of Devil’s Fruit.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 200
1 ≤ N ≤ 10000
1 ≤ Fi ≤ 500

 

Example
Input:
231 2 27455 344 674 455 344 344 455

Output:
2 2455 3
 

Explanation
Example case 1. The ID 2 has maximum number of slices so I=2 and number of slices, S=2
Example case 2. Both ID's 455 and 344 have maximum number of slices so, we choose the one with higher value. So, I=455 and number of slices, S=3
