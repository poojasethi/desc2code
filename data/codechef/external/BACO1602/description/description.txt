In this Problem, You have been given a string S of size N containg the lowercase alphabet characters. You need to perform Q queries on strings.
There are two type of queries:
1 c : output the number of times character c occur in string, here c is a lowercase alphabet. 
2 x c: replace x^th character(1-based indexing) in string with charcter c, here c is a lowercase alphabet.

Input

First line of input contains two integers N and Q, denoting the size of string and no. of queries to be performed
Second line of input contains the string S of size N.
Next Q lines of input contains the queries either of type 1 or 2 as mentioned in problem statement.

 

Output

For each query of type 1 output the answer on a single line.


Constraints

1 ≤ N,Q ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ x ≤ N

 

Example
Input:

9 3
techhertz
1 t
2 1 m
1 t


Output:

2
1
 

Explanation
In first query, no. of counts of character 't' in string "techhertz" is 2. In second query we replaced 1st character with 'm', so string now becomes "mechhertz". In third query then counts of 't' in "mechhertz" becomes 1.
