Your friend Aditya and you are getting bored in the Math lecture, so Aditya thinks of a problem and challenges you to
solve it. The problem is that, you are given a set of numbers by your friend and your job is to find the largest number that can be formed by concatenating them all, without breaking any number. Now you want to give the answer as quickly as possible so you decide to devise a program for the same, during your next lab session. Your job in this question is to make a program for the same.


Input

The first line of input consist of the number of test cases 'T' followed by a blank line, where 'T' is an integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 50).
The next line contains 'x' (number of elements in the set 1 ≤ x ≤ 20) followed by the 'x' numbers of the set on the next line separated by spaces. These 'x' numbers would be in accordance with "unsigned long" in C Language on a 32-bit system. Each test case input is seperated by a blank line as shown below. Assume that the input is error free.


Output

For each test, print the largest number possible on a new line. The expected output answer will be less than 40 digits.


Sample Input:
3

3
7 45 63

4
9 97 99 7

3
1 12 112

Sample Output:
