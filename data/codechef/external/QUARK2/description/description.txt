Mine Field

Johnny is standing at top-left corner (1,1) of a rectangular field of size RxC and his objective is to reach the bottom right corner (R,C) of the field.
Johnny can only travel in 3 directions:- East, South, South east
On each move he can move 1 unit in any of the chosen direction. He also cannot move out of the field.

Now this wouldn't have been so difficult if the field wasn't rigged with mines. Since Johnny wishes to reach his destination in one piece he cannot 
move into those parts of the field where there are mines. He asks you for help. You have to help him by telling him the number of ways in which he can 
reach his destination. Since the answer could be very large output the result modulo 1000003.


Input
First line of the input file contains T the number of test cases and T cases follow. Each test case starts with three integers R,C,M which describe the 
size of the field (R rows and C columns) and M denotes the number of Mines in the field. Then M lines follow each containing two integers mr,mc 
specifying the exact location of the mine in the field. The top-left and bottom-right corner are always mine free. Each test case is separated by new 
line. All indices are 1 based.



Output
Output T lines each giving the number of ways (modulo 1000003) in which Johnny can safely reach the required location.
