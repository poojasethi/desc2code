Earlier days, in BUEST, salary to teachers is given in the form of special coins named as BUEST coins. Any teacher could exchange it with the bank into three coins n/,n/3/n/4. But since in the world, it will be very difficult with those decimals to purchase things so simply bank rounds off the values. As the institute has foreign collaboration with universities, so in a faculty exchange program if a teacher goes to Japan, then he could exchange BUEST cons with Yen. Suppose you have one BUEST coin.
