The newly forged country of Eflium wants in on the T20 action. They want to hold tryouts for the citizens to make a team and win the World T20. Selecting a team is hard business. The president wants to hold tryouts based on locations, while the captain and selectors want to hold selections based on skill levels. So they decide to make a plan and cooperate with each other

The Eflium Cricket Board (ECB) can hold a tryout based on either a location or based on skill level. If they hold it based on a location 'L', then players belonging to location 'L' can attend the tryout irrespective of their skill level. If they hold it based on a skill level 'S', then players of that skill level from all locations can attend that tryout at the capital.

Each day Eflium can organize only one tryout. Since Eflium is a small country, players can attend tryouts on consectutive days without any problem.

You are given each players location and skill level. Help ECB by telling them the minimum number of tryouts they need to organize to give every player atleast one tryout they can attend. 

Input
Input description.
The first line of the input contains an integer denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows 
The first line contains  n , the number of test cases. Then  n  lines follow, each describing a player. 
Each player description consists of a lowercase string  L  and an integer  S  which denotes the skill level of that player. These are seperated by a space.


Output
Output description.
For each test case output a single line containing the minimum number of days ECB needs to hold tryouts so that every player gets atleast 1 chance to attend a tryout.
 

Constraints
Should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have. Format it like:

1 ≤ T ≤ 30
1 ≤ n ≤ 1000
1 ≤ |L| ≤ 10
0 ≤ S ≤ 400
L contains lowercase english alphabet 
The number of different L in a test case is not more than 400

 

Example
Input:
2
3
abax 30
baltha 20
calti 10
3
abax 30
baltha 30
baltha 20

Output:

2
 

Explanation
Test case 1. ECB needs atleast 3 days to give every player a chance. One way is to hold first tryout session at abax, the second tryout session for players having a skill level of 10, and the last trytout session at baltha. There are many other ways to do this, this is just one of the ways
Test case 2. First day ECB can hold a tryout session for everyone at baltha, and then a tryout session at abax. Or they could hold a tryout session for everyone having skill level 30, and one more tryout session at baltha. Either way you need atleast 2 days
