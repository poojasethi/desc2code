 
Chef Amit is learning factorial. After learning, he noticed that the number of digits in
factorials of numbers are increasing rapidly. For example, 5! has 3 digits (120) while 7! has 4 digits
(5040). Now he is curious in finding the number of digits in x! where x is a number input. Help him
find it.
Definition : Factorial is defined as x!=x.(x-1).(x-2)...3.2.1 i.e. product of all numbers from 1
to x both inclusive.
 

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
Next T lines contain a single integer x each.

Output
For each test case, output a single integer which is the number of digits in the
factorial.

Constraints

1<=T<=1000

0<=x<1000000

 

Example
Input:
5
5
9
1
3
2

Output:
3
6
1
1
1
Explanation :
5! = 120 (3 digits)
9! = 362880 (6 digits)
1! = 1 (1 digit)
3! = 6 (1 digit)
2! = 2 (1 digit)
