 
Now a days it is possible to access particular website without typing it's full name. This helps in reducing the typing time. So in this you are given a website name as input and you have to cut short it's name and print the shoretd length of the website. The shortened version of the website name will be such that a user
  

won't have to type 'www.' to open a website anymore.
You don't need to type vowels
Though, you still need to type '.com' to open a website.
Obviously, this means you can type the name of a website faster and save some time.

 

Input

The second line contains the name of websites, as a string.

1 <= Length of the website <= 200
