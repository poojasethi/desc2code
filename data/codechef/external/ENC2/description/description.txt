Having flexed his grey cells a bit, Little Neumann craves for more. Having been taught the basics of English and Latin, he now sees the golden thread connecting the English language and his primary fascination, mathematics.

Having seen long words in his study, Little Neumann wants to know the maximum number of words a given word can be split into, such that the resulting words all form legitimate words contained in a given dictionary.

For example, the string AMANGO can be split as {A, MANGO}, {A, MAN, GO} and {AM, AN, GO}, wherein, each of the resulting words is contained within the dictionary {A, AM, AN, GO, MAN}, here the final set of split up words does not produce any word that is not contained in the dictionary.


Input
 First line contains the number of test cases to follow, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10,
Next line contains the String, n that has to be divided into words. The size of the string is between [1,1500], both inclusive.
Next line contains, l the number of words in the dictionary, 1 ≤ l ≤ 100
Next l line contains l words.

Note: There is one line gap between two test cases.


Output
For each test case output the maximum number of words that can be generated from the string.
