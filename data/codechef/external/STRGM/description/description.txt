Alice and Bob are playing a game, Alice picks a string S which is unknown to Bob. Bob asks Alice to run Q queries on the string. There are three possible types of query that Bob can ask for. Following are the description of the queries:

S x: Substitute the character at the first position with x.
D y: Delete all occurrences of character y from the string.
R n: Arrange the first n characters in reverse order and leave the rest of the characters as it is.

After the Q queries have been applied to the string, Bob chooses a character c, if the character occurs even number of times, Bob wins, else he looses.

Input
The first  line of input contains the string S. The next line contains Q, the number of queries. Q lines follow, each containing a query. The next line after the queries contains the character c that Bob chooses.

Output
Output consists of a single line. Output "YES" (without double quotes) if Bob wins, else output "NO" (without double quotes).

Constraints
Should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have. Format it like:

1 ≤ |S| ≤ 100
1 ≤ Q ≤ 100
'a' ≤ x ≤ 'z'
'a' ≤ y ≤ 'z'
0 ≤ n ≤ min(|S|, 9)
