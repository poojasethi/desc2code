Given a positive integer 'N' , find the number of positive integers less than or equal to N, which are relatively prime to N.

Two positive integers 'a' and 'b' are called relatively prime if gcd(a,b) = 1 (Where gcd is Greatest Common Divisor).

Input

The first line consists of a number 't' which specifies the number of test cases. 1 ≤ t ≤ 10000. 't' lines follow with a number 'n' on each line. 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6

Output

For each test case, output the number of positive integers less than or equal to N which are relatively prime to N.

Example

Input:
5
1
2
4
10
20

Output:
1
1
2
4
8
