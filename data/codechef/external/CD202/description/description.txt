Brachiosaurus is trying to become a detective by writing words in codes. It manipulates each word in a sentence by putting the letter 'z' after each vowel, followed by that very vowel. 
Eg- "belina" translates into "bezelizinaza" and "zazhiba" translates into "zazazhizibaza". A team of secret agents want to decode the sentences of Brachiosaurus. 
Write a program that decodes Brachiosaurus's coded sentences. 



Input
The coded sentence is given on a single line. The sentence comprises only of lowercase letters of the English alphabet and spaces. The words will be separated by exactly one space and there will be no spaces at beginning or end. The number of characters (total) will be 100 at the max. 


Output
The decoded sentence is to be outputted on a single line.


Example

Input:
razat geze hozotazamnaza ozoraza bezehizisaza 

Output:
rat ge hotamna ora behisa
