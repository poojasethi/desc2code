In Chefland, everybody loves to play tennis. There are lefties and righties in Chefland. The laws of Chefland physics dictate that the probability of every lefty player winning against any righty player is P.


Today Chefland will organize its first grand slam tournament in which M lefty and N righty player will participate. It is guaranteed that M + N is a power of two.The draw is assumed to be a full balanced binary tree with one player assigned to each of the leaves, and thus every player would have to win the same number of games to get to the final. Initial draw is chosen uniformly at random from all permutations.


Chef wants to see the next Rafael Nadal being produced in Chefland, and was therefore wondering about the probability of the tournament being won by a lefty player?  Please help Chef in finding it.

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. Each test case contains three space separated numbers,  an integer N, an integer M, and a real P respectively.

Output
For each test case, output a real number corresponding to the probability of the tournament won by a lefty player. Your answer will be considered correct if it has an absolute error less than 1e-6.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10000
0 ≤ N, M ≤ 64
1 ≤ N + M ≤ 64
N + M is a power of 2.
P has at most five digits after the decimal point.
0 ≤ P ≤ 1


Example
Input:
2
2 2 0.5
31 1 0.3

Output:
0.5
0.00243

Explanation
Example case 1. In this case everything is symmetrical, meaning that the probability of the tournament being won by a lefty player is the same as that for a righty player.
One of the many possibility draw looks like 


Example case 2. In this case the left handed player should win 5 matches in a row against right handers. This probability is (0.3)^5
