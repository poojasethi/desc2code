Given an array A consisting of N integers with element at position i denoted by A[i].
Find the minimum number of disjoint contiguous subarrays into which original array can be split such that the sum of elements included over all the sub-arrays must be greater than or equal to M. Any element of the original array can be left out and may not be included in one of the disjoint sub-array obtained after splitting.

More formally, if S1, S2, S3.. ,SK are the K disjoint subarrays obtained, then following equation should hold true:-

Sum(S1) + Sum(S2) ... + Sum(SK) ≥ M 
 There will be multiple queries each containing different values of M. You have to answer such queries as fast as possible.
If it is not possible to split in such a way, print "Not Possible" without quotes.

Input

 First line of input contains N denoting number of elements in the array
Next line contains N space separated integers denoting number of elements in the array.
 Next line contains  Q  denoting number of queries.
 Each query contains the sum required M 


Output

 For each query output the required number of disjoint sub-arrays or "Not Possible" (without quotes) if sum cannot be obtained.


Constraints

 1 ≤  N  ≤ 100
 1 ≤  M  ≤ 10^9
 1 ≤ Q  ≤  50000 
|Ai| ≤ 10^9


Example
Input:
6 
1 -1 -2 1 1 1
1
4

Output:
2

Explanation
We can take two sub-arrays [1,1] and [4,6] and we can get the required sum 3.( assuming 1- based indexing)
