As we our chef likes to play with words. Today he is calculating the power of words .The power of a word is calculated by finding the vowels in the word and adding their respective positions in the English alphabet series.(For eg:- a=1; e=5, i=9 and so on). You have to give N words to chef and chef  will rearrange those words in the decreasing order of their power.
Note: If the power of two numbers is same, then their order remains same as given.


Input

The first line of the input will contain a single integer T (T â‰¤ 100) indicating the number of test cases.
For each test case the first line contains the value of N.

The next N lines contains different words given to chef.


Output
For each test case output the given set of words in the decreasing order of their power.


Constraints

1<=T<=100
1<=N<=20
Length of each word <=30 characters.



Example
Input:
1
3
calculus
nirvana
codechef

Output:
calculus
codechef
nirvana

Explaination
calculus=a+u+u=1+21+21=43
nirvana=i+a+a=9+1+1=11
codechef=o+e+e=15+5+5=25

Hence the order is calculus, codechef, nirvana.
