Given N points on the plane, represented as (xi, yi) where both xi and yi are integers, you need to tell us the maximum number of distinct points that lie on a straight line. 

Your algorithm needs to be really efficient.

Input
The first line of the input contains the number of test cases T, atmost 10. Each of the next T lines contains the description of a single test case. Each test case begins with the value of N, the number of points in the plane, at most 700. Each of the next N lines contains two space separated integers which specify the coordinates of the points in the plane. Each point (xi, yi) satisfies -1000 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 1000.


Output
For each test case in the input, print on a new line the maximum number of points that lie on a straight line.


Example

Input:
1
5
1 0
2 1
3 2
4 4
-8 -8

Output:
3
