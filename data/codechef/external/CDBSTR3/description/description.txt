Today its going to be the Big Byteland FundRaiser Event. Many people who are to raise funds for their cause will be coming to this event.
Carol has been having some financial issues with her NGO. Today she’ll have to convince some of the donors to donate for her NGO.
As she has good links with the organisers, she managed to gather a description of the fixed donors disposition on the room (which is represented as an N × N square matrix), such that she knows in advance the amount each person will donate. She also knows
that the room is divided into several parallel corridors, such that we will denote the j-th cell on corridor i, as [i][j].
 Note that some donors can donate Carol, zero money or negative money(taking back what they consented to give already), as they may change their minds.
There is just one donor at each cell of the matrix, except the cells [1][1] and [N][N]. To complete her fundraising, she must start on the top leftmost corner of the room (cell [1][1]), and finish on the bottom right corner (cell [N][N]), moving either to the cell directly in front of her on the same corridor (that is, moving from cell [r][c] to cell [r][c+1], where c+1 <= N) or to the cell in the next corridor directly in front of where she is (that is, moving from cell [r][c] to cell [r+1][c], where r+1 <= N). She will keep doing this until she reaches the end point of the room, i.e. last cell [N][N] on the last corridor. Carol will convince all visited cells with a donor.
Carol wants to maximize her average donation at end. More specifically, if she passes K donors, each being on cell [i1][j1],
 cell [i2][j2], ..., cell [iK][jK] respectively, then she wants to maximize (S[i1][j1] + S[i2][j2] + ... + S[iK][jK]) / K, where S[i][j] denotes the amount that the donor will give her on the cell [i][j].
Help her determine the best path she has to follow in order to maximize the average donations.


Input


The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.


The  first  line  contains  a  single  integer N denoting the number of size of matrix.
 Each  of  the  next  N  lines  contains  N  space-separated  integers.


Note : 
The j-th integer S[i][j] in i-th line denotes the donation donated by the donor at cell [i][j].
Note that the cells [1][1] and [N][N] have no donors, so S[1][1] and S[N][N] will be 0.

 

Output
For each test case, if the maximum possible average funds  Carol can obtain is negative, output a single line containing "No funds" (quotes for clarity). Otherwise, output the maximum possible average funds. The answer will be considered correct if it has an absolute error no more than 10^-6.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤  50 
2 ≤ N ≤  100 
-1000 ≤ S[i][j] ≤  1000 
S[1][1] = S[N][N] =  0
