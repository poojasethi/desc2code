Addition is one of the most important operations in any number system. In all number system addition is done in the similar manner. The binary number system represents numeric values using two symbols: 0 and 1. If you want to increase a number by 1, try to increase its last digit by 1. If this fails, set the last digit to zero, and try to increase the previous digit, and so on. You are given a number N in binary representation and your job is to calculate N+1 in binary representation.


Input
Input will begin with an integer T, the number of test cases. Then there are T lines, each containing exactly one number N in binary representation.
N will contain only 0 and 1.
The length of N will be between 1 and 20.
1 ≤ T ≤ 50


Output
For every number N, output a single line containing the N+1 in binary representation
