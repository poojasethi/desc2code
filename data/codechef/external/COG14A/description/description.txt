 
After studying boolean algebra Leonardo defined L-binary numbers (which contains only 0’s and 1’s).
A binary number is L-binary if it does not contain K consecutive zeros and does not have leading zeros.
Find the number of L-Binary Numbers of length N.

 

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
Next T lines contains 2 integers N and K.


Output
Print a line for each test case containing the required answer modulo 1000000007.
 

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ N ≤ 10000
1 ≤ K ≤ 10

 

Example
Sample Input:
2
1 1
