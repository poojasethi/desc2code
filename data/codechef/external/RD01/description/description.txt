The Problem is pretty simple and straight forward.
Calculate the sum of coefficients of (x+y)^n


Input

First line will contain the number of Test Cases T( 0 < T < 10^5 ). Further T line will contains one number n. ( 0 < n < 10^7 ).


Output

For each Test Case print single line having the sum of coefficients. If result exceed 1000000007 take mod with the result.
