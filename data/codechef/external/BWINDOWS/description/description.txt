Problem Description:
Dr Watson loves to post the cases solved by Sherlock Holmes online. Every story that is put on his blog is mysterious and exciting. This time there is a twist, Sherlock Holmes has solved the mystery all on his own and refuses to tell Dr Watson who is the person that is guilty. Frustrated by this Watson posts all the clues and the events online. He expects someone intelligent enough to solve the case and let him know, how sherlock solved it. Although this information is not readily available and is in an encrypted form. He does so, so that all the people do not come to know that Watson is still puzzled, and out of the few who do he expects an answer…
 
The following was posted on his blog:

The place where he used to write “The Game is On”, he wrote ”tas* hmo* een* gi**”. I can tell this as I have been reading his blogs regularly. Now it is upto you to figure out the rest of the message and help Dr. Watson. (Hint: Try writing the words in the encoded message one below the other. * does not have significant meaning like space or something.)


Being a technosavy person I expect that you will: 
1) Figure out the algorithm.
2) Make a program to implement it.
3) Take the entire message and run your code on it.
4) Get the Final decrypted message.
5) Solve the case.

Ultimately, you have to write a code which will print your final word answer. If answer is "abc xyz utv" you have to print "Abc Xyz Utv". Do not print the quotes.
