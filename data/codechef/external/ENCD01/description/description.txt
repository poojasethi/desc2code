Sam lives in a country "CoinLand" where there are n different types of coin. He wants to collect as many different types of coin as he can. Now if he wants to withdraw X amount of money from a Bank, the Bank will give him this money according to the following rule:

lets say sam needs to withdraw money 'x'.

1. if X=0 no money withdrawn.
2. Let Y be the highest valued coin that does not exceed X. Give the customer Y valued coin. Now he has to withdraw remaining X-Y amount.
3. go to step 1.
this goes on until x becomes = 0.

Now Sam can withdraw any amount of money from the Bank. He should maximize the number of different coins that he can collect in a single withdrawal.


 
Input

Each of the test cases starts with n (1≤n≤1000), the number of different types of coin. Next line contains n integers C1, C2, ... , Cn the value of each coin type. C1 < C2 < C3 <  …  < Cn < 1000000000.  C1 equals to 1.Terminate the input with n=0.



Output
For each test case output one line denoting the maximum number of coins that Sam can collect in a single withdrawal. He can withdraw infinite amount of money from the Bank.
