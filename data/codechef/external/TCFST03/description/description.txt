 
Samuel has n boxes of blue balls to dispatch to his clients. Each of the boxes is numbered from 1 to n, such that the number of blue balls in each box - a(i) is such that a(1), a(2) … a(n) are sorted in non-decreasing order.
In a complex encoding of his records that Samuel follows, he writes integers 2^a(1), 2^a(2), 2^a(3) ….. 2^a(n) on paper. Now in order to represent this set of boxes, he requires to find the minimum number of integers of the type 2^m (m is non-negative) that must be written on his piece of paper (as described earlier) such that the sum total of all integers present on the paper equals (2^k - 1) for some integer k (k is non-negative)


Input
The input consists of an integer n in first line. The second input line contains n space-separated integers a(1), a(2), ..., a(n).


Output
Consists of a single integer - required answer.

 

Constraints
