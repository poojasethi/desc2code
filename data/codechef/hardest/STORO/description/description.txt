Recently, with the release of the ultimate computing device bytePad, a platform game with the simple name "Rotation Puzzle" immediately became a phenomenon among Bytelandians. The game is extremely simple, yet quite additive. Here's the rule:
Given a MxN rectangular grid in which each cell contains a unique number from 1 to MxN. In each step, the player can pick any 2x2 subgrid and perform a rotation (whether clockwise or counterclockwise).
The task is to transform from the initial grid to the final configuration, using as few steps as possible.
The final configuration is the configuration


1
2
...
n


n+1
n+2
...
2n


...
...
...
...


(m-1)n+1
(m-1)n+2
...
mn


You may have guessed why this game is addictive: it requires a tremendous visualization skill!


Input
The first line contains a number T (about 5000), which is the number of test cases. Each test case has the following form.
The first line contains two numbers M and N (2 ≤ M, N ≤ 33).
The next M lines contains the description of the grid.
Each test case's input is separated by a blank line.
It is guaranteed that each input data has a solution.


Output
For each test case, output the result in the following format.
The first line contains a number K, the number of steps you need to solve the puzzle. K must not exceed 10000.
Each line of the next K lines contain three numbers c, i, j (c=0 or c=1, 1 ≤ I < M, 1 ≤ J < N). (i,j) is the top-left coordinate of the 2x2 square that is need to be rotated. c=1 if the rotation if clockwise and c=0 if the rotation is counter-clockwise.
Prints a blank link after each test case's output.


Scoring
Given m and n, we pick a random positive integer K* and starting from the final configuration, we perform a random operation K* times to generate the test case. 
For each test case, your score is K*/K. 
Higher score is
better.
