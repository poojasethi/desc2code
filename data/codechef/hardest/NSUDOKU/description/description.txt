Quoting  Wikipedia  :
"Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 boxes (also called blocks or regions) contains the digits from 1 to 9 only one time each. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid."

The rules for an N^2 X N^2 sudoku are as follows :

The board is consists of N^2 rows and N^2 columns.
Numbers between 1 and N^2(inclusive) are to be filled in each row such that :
All numbers in each row are distinct.
All numbers in each column are distinct.
All numbers in the sub-matrix having rows from (i*N + 1) to(i + 1)*N, and columns from (j*N + 1) to (j + 1)*N both inclusive, should be distinct. 0 <= i,j <= N-1. Rows and columns are 1 indexed. Each such sub-matrix is called a "box" or "region".


For this problem, you are required to solve a general N^2X N^2 sudoku puzzle. Given a partially filled sudoku board, you have to fill it in as "perfect" a manner as possible.


Input :

The first line contains N,K.
The following K lines contain 3 numbers: x, y and d. 1 <= x,y,d <= N^2.
This means that a number d is present on the board at position (x,y)
2 <= N <= 30
0 <= K <= N^4
At most 50% of the board will be covered at the start.
All positions (x,y) in the input will be unique.


Output :
The output consists of N^2 rows having N^2 numbers each. Each number should be between 1 and N^2 (inclusive) and separated by a space. If the initial grid has a number d at position (x,y), then even the output should have the number d at position (x,y).


Scoring :


For each row and every number K in the range 1 to N^2 that is missing from the row, incurs a penalty of 1.
For each column and every number K in the range 1 to N^2 that is missing from the column, incurs a penalty of 1.
Similary, for each box and every number K in the range 1 to N^2 that is missing from the box, incurs a penalty of 1.
A box (as explained above) is a N X N square and the grid can be divided into N^2 such non-overlapping boxes.


Example :


Input:

2 4
1 2 1
2 4 4
3 3 1
4 1 3


Output:

2 1 3 4
1 2 4 4
3 4 1 2
3 2 4 1



Penalty: (0 + 1 + 0 + 0) + (1 + 1 + 1 + 1) + (2 + 2 + 1 + 1) = 11
