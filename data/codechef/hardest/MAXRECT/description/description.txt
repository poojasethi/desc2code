You are given a matrix of the size H × W with integer elements. So it has H rows and W columns. The rows are numbered by integers in the range [0, H – 1] while for the columns the range [0, W – 1] is used. Your task is to find out a sub-rectangle of this matrix with a large sum. The sum of a sub-rectangle is the sum of all its elements. However, sub-rectangle does not need to be contiguous. More formally, you have to find out a subset of rows R and a subset of columns C. Then your sub-rectangle contains all those cells (r, c) where r is in R and c is in C.


This is a challenge problem so you don't have to find out the optimal solution. You would get a partial score depending on how large the sum of your chosen rectangle is.


Input

The first line of the input contains two space separated integers H and W, the height and the width of the matrix respectively. Each of the following H lines contains W space separated integers, the elements of the corresponding row of the matrix.


Output

Your output should consist of 3 lines. The first line of the output should contain two space separated integers R_SIZE and C_SIZE, the sizes of your row set and the column set respectively. In the next line there should be R_SIZE distinct integers in the range [0, H – 1] in ascending order, the set of rows you have chosen. In the third line there should be C_SIZE distinct integers in the range [0, W – 1] in ascending order, the set of columns you have chosen.


Your program will get accepted if and only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:

Both your row set and column set are non-empty, that is, R_SIZE ≥ 1 and C_SIZE ≥ 1.
The second line of your output contains R_SIZE distinct integers in the range [0, H – 1] in ascending order.
The third line of your output contains C_SIZE distinct integers in the range [0, W – 1] in ascending order.
The sum of your chosen sub-rectangle is positive. You are guaranteed that such a sub-rectangle always exists.


Scoring

Let numerator = Sum of your chosen sub-rectangle
and denominator = Sum of all positive elements of the matrix.


Then your score for a single file is equal to numerator / denominator. Your total score is the average of individual scores for each file multiplied by 10000 for convenience. Your goal is to maximize your total score.


Constraints

1 ≤ H, W ≤ 300
Each element of the matrix does not exceed 10^9 by the absolute value.
There exists a sub-rectangle of the given matrix which has positive sum.
In each official test file H, W ≥ 200.


Example

Input:
3 3
-1 -2 4
2 3 -1
8 9 -1

Output:
1 2
1
1 2


Explanation

In this output the set of one row R = {1} and the set of two columns C = {1, 2} have been chosen. The chosen cells of the matrix are M[1][1] = 3, M[1][2] = -1 (recall that the numeration of rows and columns is 0-based). So the sum of the chosen sub-rectangle is 3 + (-1) = 2 > 0. The sum of all positive elements of the matrix is 4 + 2 + 3 + 8 + 9 = 26. So the score you will get for such output is 2 / 26 = 0.0769231. Note that this is not the optimal solution for this matrix.
