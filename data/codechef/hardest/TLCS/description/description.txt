For a given two words x = x1x2...xn
and y = y1y2...ym
find the longest common subsequence, i.e. z = z1z2...zk
such that every two consecutive elements of z are equal to some two elements of x: xa, xb, and y: yc, yd where a < b and c < d. Assume, that elements of words are letters 'a' - 'z' and m,n ≤ 1000.


Input

t [the number of test cases ≤ 1000]
n x
m y
...


Output

case 1 Y [or N when no answer to this case]
d [the length of the lcs]
zj p q [position of zj in x and in y, respectively]
