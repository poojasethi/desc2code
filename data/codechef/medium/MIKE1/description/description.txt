Mike is given a matrix A, N and M are numbers of rows and columns respectively. A1, 1 is the number in the top left corner. All the numbers in A are non-negative integers. He also has L pairs of integers (ik, jk). His task is to calculate Ai1, j1 + Ai2, j2 + ... + AiL, jL.


Unfortunately, Mike forgot if Ai, j was a number in the i'th row and j'th column or vice versa, if Ai, j was a number in the j'th row and i'th column.


So, Mike decided to calculate both E1 = Ai1, j1 + Ai2, j2 + ... + AiL, jL and E2 = Aj1, i1 + Aj2, i2 + ... + AjL, iL. If it is impossible to calculate E1(i.e. one of the summands doesn't exist), then let's assume, that it is equal to -1. If it is impossible to calculate E2, then let's also assume, that it is equal to -1.


Your task is to calculate max(E1, E2).


Input

The first line contains two integers N and M, denoting the number of rows and the number of columns respectively.
Each of next N lines contains M integers. The j'th integer in the (i + 1)'th line of the input denotes Ai, j.


The (N + 2)'th line contains an integer L, denoting the number of pairs of integers, that Mike has.
Each of next L lines contains a pair of integers. The (N + 2 + k)-th line in the input contains a pair (ik, jk).


Output
The first line should contain an integer, denoting max(E1, E2).

Explanation

In the first test case N equals to 3, M equals to 2, L equals to 2. E1 = 2 + 5 = 7, E2 = 4 + 5 = 9. The answer is max(E1, E2) = max(7, 9) = 9;


In the second test case N equals to 1, M equals to 3, L equals to 2. It is impossible to calculate E1 and E2, because A3, 1 doesn't exist. So the answer is max(E1, E2) = max(-1, -1) = -1;


In the third test case N equals to 1, M equals to 3, L equals to 2. It is impossible to calculate E1, because A3, 1 doesn't exist. So E1 is equal to -1. E2 = 1 + 3 = 4. The answer is max(E1, E2) = max(-1,4) = 4.
