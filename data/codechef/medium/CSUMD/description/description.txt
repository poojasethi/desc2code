        There are coins of 2 different denominations in Crazyland, 1-cent coins and 2-cent coins. As all the coins do, even these coins have two faces, i.e. heads and tails.
        Your task is to find out the the number of ways to create a linear arrangement of these coins so that their sum is N cents. The only condition on the linear arrangement is that
        the first coin in the arrangement should always face heads. All other coins could either face head or face tail.
        


        Take N = 2 as an example. The possible arrangements are (1H, 1H), (2H), (1H, 1T), where H is heads and T is tails.
        Therefore there are 3 possible arrangements that sum up to 2-cents.
    

Note


        While counting make sure that you count heads and tails as different.
    

Input


        First line contains T, the number of cases.
    

T lines follow, each containing a single number N, the required sum.
    

Constraints


        0 <= T <= 10000
    

        1 <= N <= 1000000000


Output


For each case the output should be a single integer representing the number of such arrangements possible. As this can be very large print it modulo        1000000007.
