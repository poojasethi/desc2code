Roman has no idea, why this problem is called Stone. He also has no idea on how to solve the followong problem: given array of N integers A and a number K. During a turn the maximal value over all Ai is chosen, let's call it MAX. Then Ai =
MAX - Ai is done for every 1 <= i <= N. Help Roman to find out how will the array look like after K turns.


Input
The numbers N and K are given in the first line of an input. Then N integers are given in the second line which denote the array A. 

Output
Output N numbers on a single line. It should be the array A after K turns.

Constraints

1 <= N <= 10^5
0 <= K <= 10^9
Ai does not exceed 2 * 10^9 by it's absolute value.


Example
Input:
4 1
5 -1 7 0

Output:
2 8 0 7
