The Head Chef has a reporting hierarchy for his chefs which is basically a binary tree i.e. Each chef reports to exactly one chef and every chef can take reporting of atmost two chefs . In case two chefs report to the same chef they must report at different times . The time of reporting can have only two values : Morning or Evening ( denoted by M and E , respectively ) .The Head Chef himself is not part of the reporting structure . The Head Chef has found that a new restaurant in Byteland is opening and it is hiring a group of chefs from some existing restaurant . The new restaurant will basically make an offer to one of the chefs and all the chefs directly or indirectly reporting to the chef . The Head Chef is worried that the new restaurant may be taking away some of his chefs . The Head Chef knows that the new restaurant will not change the reporting structure of the chefs . The Head Chef also has access to the reporting structure of the new restaurant in terms of ages of Chefs  . The Head Chef wants to know whether there is a need to worry or not . He needs to worry if the new restaurant can possibly be targetting his chefs . 

In short given a tree  T and another tree O you need to tell whether  O  is a subtree of  T  or not . The node values of  T  or  O  need not be distinct as they represent the age of the Chef . Also , a subtree of a rooted tree includes a particular node and the entire tree structure below it . 
 Two trees A and B are considered same if age(A->root ) = age(B->root) and subtree rooted at A->left is same as subtree rooted at B->left and subtree rooted at A->right is same as subtree rooted B->right .


Input

The first line of the input contains an integer N denoting the number of chefs in Head Chef's restaurant. The Chefs are denoted by number 1 to N .
 The next  N  lines contain ages of the chefs with the i th line containing the age of chef i . 
 The next  N - 1 lines contain two integers  A  and  B  and a character  C  which is either 'M' or 'E' where A  denotes the senior chef and B  denotes the reporting chef , and the character C   denotes the time of reporting . 
The next line of the input contains an integer Q denoting the number of queries/possible structures of chefs of new restaurant . This is followed by description of Q queries . 
The first line of each query contains an integer M denoting the number of chefs in new restaurant. The Chefs are denoted by numbers 1  to M. 
 The next  M  lines contain the ages of the chefs with the i th line denoting the age of chef  i .
 The next  M - 1 lines contain two integers  A  and  B  and a character  C  which is either 'M'  or 'E' where B  denotes the reporting chef and A  denotes the chef who takes the reporting , and the character C   denotes the time of reporting . 


Output

For each test case answer "YES" or "NO" as applicable .
