It is well-known that the elephants are afraid of mouses. The Little Elephant from the Zoo of Lviv is not an exception.

The Little Elephant is on a board A of n rows and m columns (0-based numeration). At the beginning he is in cell with coordinates (0; 0) and he wants to go to cell with coordinates (n-1; m-1). From cell (x; y) Little Elephant can go either to (x+1; y) or (x; y+1).

Each cell of the board contains either 1 or 0. If A[i][j] = 1, then there is a single mouse in cell (i; j). Mouse at cell (i; j) scared Little Elephants if and only if during the path there was at least one such cell (x; y) (which belongs to that path) and |i-x| + |j-y| <= 1.

Little Elephant wants to find some correct path from (0; 0) to (n-1; m-1) such that the number of mouses that have scared the Little Elephant is minimal possible. Print that number.


Input
First line contains single integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. First line of each test case contain pair of integers n and m - the size of the board. Next n lines contain n strings, each of size m and consisted of digits 0 and 1.


Output
In T lines print T integer - the answers for the corresponding test.


Constraints

1 <= T <= 50

2 <= n, m <= 100

Explanation
Example case 1: 
The optimized path is: (0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (0, 2) -> (0, 3) -> (0, 4) -> (0, 5) -> (0, 6) -> (0, 7) -> (0, 8) -> (1, 8) -> (2, 8). The mouses that scared the Little Elephant are at the following cells: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 7), (0, 2), (0, 8).

Example case 2: 
The optimized path is: (0, 0) -> (1, 0) -> (1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 2) -> (3, 2) -> (3, 3) -> (4, 3) -> (4, 4) -> (5, 4) -> (5, 5) -> (6, 5) -> (6, 6) -> (6, 7) -> (6, 8). The 10 mouses that scared the Little Elephant are at the following cells: (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 6), (6, 8).
