'''
    *  royal flush - ace, king, queen, jack and ten, all in the same suit
    * straight flush - five cards of the same suit in sequence, such
      as 10,9,8,7,6 of clubs; ace can be counted both as the highest card or as the
      lowest card - A,2,3,4,5 of hearts is a straight flush. But 4,3,2,A,K of hearts is not a straight flush - it's just a flush.
    * four of a kind - four cards of the same rank, such as four kings.
    * full house - three cards of one rank plus two cards of another rank
    * flush - five cards of the same suit (but not a straight flush)
    * straight - five cards in order - just like the straight flush, but mixed suits
    * three of a kind - three cards of one rank and two other cards
    * two pairs - two cards of one rank, two cards of another rank, and one more card
    * pair - two cards of the same rank
    * high card - none of the above
