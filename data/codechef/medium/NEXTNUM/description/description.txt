Note that id's can start with 0 . Given a number, find the rank of the number .

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
 Each test case contains a single integer N denoting the id the chef has received .


Output

For each test case, output a single line containing the answer to the given test case . 


Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10000
1 ≤ number of digits in N ≤ 18


Example
Input:
2
276
762

Output:
2
6

Explanation
Example case 1.The numbers that can be formed with one '2' ; one '7' and one '6' in increasing order are : 
267 
276
