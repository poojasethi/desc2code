The Chef is given a sequence of N integers A1,  A2, ..., AN. He has to process Q queries on the above sequence. Each query is represented by three integers:


L R K => report cardinality of { i : K divides Ai, L ≤ i ≤ R }. In other words, how many integers in the subsequence starting at L^th element and ending at R^th element are divisible by K.



Input
The first line of the input contains two space separated integer N  and Q.
The following line contains N space separated integers giving the sequence A1,  A2, ..., AN.
Then there will be Q lines each containing three space separated integers L R K, representing a query.
 

Output
For each query output the result in one line.

Constraints

1 ≤ N, Q  ≤ 100000 (10^5)
1 ≤ Ai  ≤ 100000 (10^5)
 1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ N
1 ≤ K  ≤ 100000 (10^5)
