This gets Time Limit

my soln is O( len(target) * n^2 )

n^2 in example is wasting time looking at "X" cells
   that aren't in string.  Could make a list of cells with each
   letter and go through the appropriate list at stage k

maybe could do some kind of bifurcation on target string.

E.g. score1[x][y] = ways to find 0..L/2 string ending at x,y
     score2[x][y] = ways to find L/2+1..L-1 starting at x,y
     total score = score1*score2

     not sure there is anything here, though


     Try list thing.
