ChefTown is the biggest city and the capital of ChefLand. There are N beautiful buildings: restaurants, museums, living houses with large kitchens and so on. Every building has its height. For every i (1 ≤ i ≤ N) there is exactly one building with height i. The buildings are located in a single line from left to right. The height of ith building is H(i). The Mayor of ChefTown wants to organize a parade, where all great chefs will take part. A parade depends of its location. The location of a parade is a segment of consecutive buildings beginning near the building number L and ending near the building number R (1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ N). Any parade won't be interesting if it is not hold on an interesting segment of buildings. The segment of buildings is interesting if following are hold:


Imagine, that we have a segment [L,R].
Let K=R-L+1 be the length of this segment, and B be a list of heights of the buildings that belong to this segment.
Let's sort B in non-decreasing order.
Segment [L,R] is interesting if B[i]-B[i-1]=1 for every i (2 ≤ i ≤ K).



Now the Mayor of ChefTown is interested how many ways to organize an interesting parade of length W for ChefTown citizens. Help him and find out the number of different parades of length W, which can be hold in the city. Two parades ([L1,R1] and [L2,R2]) are considered to be different, if L1≠L2 or R1≠R2.


Input
 Each input file consists of two lines, the first one contains two integers N and W (1 ≤ N ≤ 400000, 1 ≤ W ≤ N). The second line contains N numbers H(i) (1 ≤ i ≤ N) - the heights of the buildings. 


Output
For each test case output a single integer - the number of interesting segments of buildings of length W.
