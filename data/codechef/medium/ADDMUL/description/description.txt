You are given a one dimensional integer array A of length N. You need to maintain the array under Q queries of the following four types. Assume 1-based indexing and M = 10^9 + 7.
Query 1 : 1 x y v  This implies adding v to array A to all the indices from x to y, i.e., 
for (i = x; i <= y; i++)	
	Ai += v;
	Ai %= M; 

 
Query 2 : 2 x y v  This implies multiplying the scalar v with the array A for all the indices from x to y, i.e., 
for (i = x; i <= y; i++)	
        Ai *= v
        Ai %= M

 
Query 3 : 3 x y v  This implies initializing the array A at all the indices from x to y with the value v, i.e., 
for (i = x; i <= y; i++)	
	Ai = v 

 
Query 4 : 4 x y This is a report query which needs to find the sum of the values in A from x to y, i.e., 
sum = 0;
for (i = x; i <= y; i++)
	sum += Ai
	sum %= M
Output sum.

 
Note: a%b represents the remainder of a when divided by b.

Input

First line contains two space separated integers N, Q.
Next line contains N space separated integers denoting the array A.
Next Q lines contain queries which can be of any of the above four types.


Output

For each query of type 4, output a single integer corresponding to the answer in a single line.


Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ Q ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ Initial value of Ai ≤ 10^9
1 ≤ v ≤ 10^9


Example
Input:
4 4
1 2 3 4
4 1 4
1 1 3 10
2 2 4 2
4 1 4

Output:
10
69



Explanation
Initial A : [1, 2, 3, 4] Result of first query : 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 A after second query: [ 11, 12, 13, 4] A after third query : [ 11, 24, 26, 8] Result of fourth query : 11 + 24 + 26 + 8 = 69
