Samosa Bhai got tired of the difficult tasks given by CodeChef along with meagre salary being paid to him. So he moves to Aloo uncle's village and opens a courier company there. In the village, everyone knows Aloo uncle and Kachori Aunty, so everyone sends their gifts using Samosa Bhai's courier company only.

There are N houses in a row in the village. On New Year's Eve, each house sends a gift to all the other houses.
The distance between two houses situated at positions x and y in the row is |x - y|. Samosa Bhai's courier company charges d^k rupees for each delivery, where d is the distance between the 2 houses. 

Everyone chose Samosa Bhai's company because of Aloo uncle and Kachori aunty. So he decides to give them the amount of money earned by him modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7). You need to compute this amount.


Input

The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains 2 integers — N and k — denoting the number of houses and the exponent k, resepctively. The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, … , AN denoting the positions of the houses. 


Output

For each test case, output a single line with the amount given to Aloo uncle and Kachori aunty by Samosa Bhai.


Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4
2 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
0 ≤ k ≤ 100
0 ≤ Ai ≤ 1000000006
The sum of N over all test cases will be at most 100000
2 houses can be at the same position

Explanation
Example case 1. House 1 sends a gift to House 2 with cost (|2 - 7|)^2 and house 2 sends a gift to house 1 with cost (|7-2|)^2, for a total cost of 50
Example case 3. The cost for gift from house with index 1 to house with index 2 is 2^2 = 4, from houses 1 to 3 is 1, from houses 2 to 3 is 1. Taking into account the gifts sent the other way (from 2 to 1, 3 to 1 and 3 to 2), the total cost is 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 12
