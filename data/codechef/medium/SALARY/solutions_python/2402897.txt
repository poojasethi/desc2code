Quick explanation of closed-form equation:
Let Mx = max salary of W
Let Mn = min salary of W
Then if we hold Mx constant and raise everyone else by Mx-Mn,
we merge the max into the rest of the previous mins and equalize it.

This will occur for each delta that exists until every local max is merged.
Therefore the number of steps is the sum of all the deltas, which is the same
as the sum of all initial W minus N*Mn
