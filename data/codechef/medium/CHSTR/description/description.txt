Chef has a string S consisting of N lowercase English alphabets. He has prepared a list L consisting of all non empty substrings of the string S.
Now he asks you Q questions. To i^th question, you need to count the number of ways to choose exactly Ki equal strings from the list L. As answer could be large you need to find it modulo 10^9+7.

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. First line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and Q denoting the length of the string S and amount of questions. The next line of each test case contains a single string S. Each of the next Q lines contains a single integer Ki.

Output
For each test case, output Q lines, each line should contain one integer - amount of ways to choose exactly Ki equal strings from the list L.

Explanation
L = {"a", "b", "a", "b", "a", "ab", "ba", "ab", "ba", "aba", "bab", "aba", "abab", "baba", "ababa"}.

k1 = 2: There are seven ways to choose two equal strings ("a", "a"), ("a", "a"), ("a", "a"), ("b", "b"), ("ab", "ab"), ("ba", "ba"), ("aba", "aba"). 
k2 = 1: We can choose any string from L (15 ways). 
k3 = 3: There is one way to choose three equal strings - ("a", "a", "a"). 
k4 = 4: There are no four equal strings in L .
