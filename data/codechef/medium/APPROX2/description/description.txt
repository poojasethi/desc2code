You are given an array of N integers a1, a2, ..., aN and an integer K. Find the number of such unordered pairs {i, j} that 

i ≠ j
|ai + aj - K| is minimal possible

Output  the minimal possible value of |ai + aj - K| (where i ≠ j) and the number of such pairs for the given array and the integer K.

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case consists of two space separated integers - N and K respectively.
The second line contains N single space separated integers - a1, a2, ..., aN respectively.


Output
For each test case, output a single line containing two single space separated integers - the minimal possible value of |ai + aj - K| and the number of unordered pairs {i, j} for which this minimal difference is reached.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 50
1 ≤ ai, K ≤ 10^9
N = 2 - 31 point.
2 ≤ N ≤ 1000 - 69 points.

 

Example
Input:
1   
4 9
4 4 2 6

Output:
1 4

Explanation:
The minimal possible absolute difference of 1 can be obtained by taking the pairs of a1 and a2, a1 and a4, a2 and a4, a3 and a4.
