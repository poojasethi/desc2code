Recently, chef Ciel often hears about lucky numbers.




Everybody knows that lucky numbers are positive integers
whose decimal representation contains only the lucky digits 4 and 7.
For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not.




Ciel decides to make Ciel numbers.
As you know, Ciel likes the digit 8 very much.
And then, Ciel likes the digits 5 and 3.
So Ciel defines Ciel numbers as the positive integers k such that d(k, 8) ≥ d(k, 5) ≥ d(k, 3) and d(k, i) = 0 for all i = 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9,
where d(k, i) denotes the number of the digit i in the decimal representation of the integer k.
For example, the first few Ciel numbers are 8, 58, 85, 88, 358, 385, 538, 583, 588, 835, 853, 858, 885, 888, ....
