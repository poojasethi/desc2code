Maxim likes arithmetic progressions and does not like sequences which are not arithmetic progressions.
Now he is interested in the question: how many subsequences of his sequence a, consisting of n elements, are not arithmetic progressions.
Sequence s[1],  s[2],  ...,  s[k] is called a subsequence of sequence a[1],  a[2],  ...,  a[n], if there will be such increasing sequence of indices i[1], i[2], ..., i[k] (1  ≤  i[1]  <  i[2]  < ...   <  i[k]  ≤  n), that a[i[j]]  =  s[j]. In other words, sequence s can be obtained from the a by deleting some elements.
Sequence s[1],  s[2],  ...,  s[k] is called an arithmetic progression, if it can be represented as : 
s[1] = p, where p — some integer;
s[i] = p + (i - 1)·q (i > 1), where q — some integer.
In particular, the empty sequence or a sequence of one element is an arithmetic progression.

 

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. 
The first line of each test case contains an integer n — the number of elements in the sequence. The next line of the test case contains n integer, a[1], a[2], ..., a[n] — elements of the sequence.


Output
For each test case print the remainder of the division the answer on 1000000007 (10^9 + 7). All answers print on different lines. 

Constraints
