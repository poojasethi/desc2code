You have initially a string of N characters, denoted by A1,A2...AN. You have to print the size of the largest subsequence of string A such that all the characters in that subsequence are distinct ie. no two characters in that subsequence should be same.
A subsequence of string A is a sequence that can be derived from A by deleting some elements  and without changing the order of the remaining elements.


Input
First line contains T, number of testcases. Each testcase consists of a single string in one line. Each character of the string will be a small alphabet(ie. 'a' to 'z').

Output
For each testcase, print the required answer in one line.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10
Example
Input:
2
abc
aba

Output:
3
2


Explanation
For first testcase, the whole string is a subsequence which has all distinct characters.
In second testcase, the we can delete last or first 'a' to get the required subsequence.
