"""Chef loves circular cakes. He divides them into smaller pieces and sells
them. You are to help him in this work.
Today Chef has cooked the brand new circular cake. To split the cake Chef can
make several (possibly, zero) cuts. Each cut should be a straight line going
from the center of the cake to its border. Also, the angle between any two cuts
should have positive integer value (Chef measure all the angles in degrees).
Chef consider two pieces of cake equal if the appropriate angles are equal.

The picture contains two distinct pieces, and two cuts. Red part on the image
shows one piece. The appropriate angle is AOB.
Chef gives to you an integer N, denoting the number of pieces Chef wants to
make. You need to answer the following questions:

Is it possible to make exactly N equal pieces from the whole cake?
Is it possible to make exactly N pieces from the whole cake?
Is it possible to make exactly N pieces from the whole cake, in such a way that
no two of them are equal?

Input

First line contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each
of the following T lines contain a single integer N denoting the number of
pieces Chef wants to make.

Output

For each test case, output one line containing 3 space separated characters.
Above, we defined the 3 questions that Chef will ask. Output 'y' for yes or 'n'
for no (quotes for clarity) for each of those questions.
Answers for 3 questions (in the order above) must be space separated on the same line.


Constraints

1 <= T <= 10000
1 <= N <= 10000

Example

Input:
2
4
7

Output:
y y y
n y y
 
Explanation

Example case 1.

Is it possible to make N equal pieces?

Yes, you can cut 4 pieces each with 90 degrees angle.

Is it possible to make N pieces?

Yes, you can cut 4 pieces each with 90 degrees angle.

Is it possible to make N pieces, such that no two of them are equal?

Yes, you can cut 4 pieces with angles 88, 89, 91, 92."""
