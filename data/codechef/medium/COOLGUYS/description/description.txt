Given an integer N. Integers A and B are chosen randomly in the range [1..N]. Calculate the probability that the Greatest Common Divisor(GCD) of A and B equals to B.

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. Each test case consists of a single integer N on a separate line.

Output
For each test case, output a single line containing probability as an irreducible fraction. 

Example
Input:
3
1
2
3

Output:
1/1
3/4
5/9

Constraints

1<=T<=10^3
1<=N<=10^9
