Each palindrome can be always created from the other palindromes, if a single character is also a palindrome. For example, the string "bobseesanna" can be created by some ways:
* bobseesanna = bob + sees + anna
* bobseesanna = bob + s + ee + s + anna
* bobseesanna = b + o + b + sees + a + n + n + a
...
We want to take the value of function CountPal(s) which is the number of different ways to use the palindromes to create the string s by the above method.

Input
The string s

Output
The value of function CountPal(s), taking the modulo of 1 000 000 007 (10^9+7)

Limitations
0 < |s| <= 1000

Example

Input:
bobseesanna

Output:
18
