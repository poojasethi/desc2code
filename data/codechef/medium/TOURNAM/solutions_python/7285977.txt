/* Caroline is a huge tennis fan. She loves watching tennis and especially
 * rooting for players of Strangeland, her native country.
 *
 * Generally, tennis tournaments are played using the Olympic system. Let's
 * consider such a tournament with N = 2K players. This tournament is held in K 
 * rounds. In each round, every player plays exactly one match against some
 * other player. The loser of each match is eliminated, and the winner advances
 * to the next round. After the Kth round, there's only one non-eliminated
 * player who is declared the champion of the tournament.
 *
 * An example of such a tournament for N = 8 can be seen in the picture below.
 *
 * We'll number the players from 1 to N from top to bottom in the tournament
 * draw for a given N. In the first round players 1 and 2, 3 and 4, ..., N-1 and
 * N play a match against each other. In the second round the winners of the
 * match between players 1 and 2 and the match between players 3 and 4 play
 * together, the winners of the match between players 5 and 6 and the match
 * between players 7 and 8 play together, ..., the winners of the match between
 * players N-3 and N-2 and the match between players N-1 and N play together.
 * The matches are played in the same way till the Kth (final) round.
 *
 * A big tennis tournament is going to start soon. M Strangelandian players are
 * taking part in this tournament, and their positions in the tournament draw
 * are known in advance. Caroline wants to know the probability that a
 * Strangelandian player will be the champion of this tournament. She collected
 * the information from the previous ten years of tennis history and knows that
 * a Strangelandian player wins a match over a non-Strangelandian player with
 * probability P percents. All non-Strangelandian players look the same to
 * Caroline, so she considers the chance of winning a match between two
 * non-Strangelandian players to be 50 percents for both players. The same
 * applies to all Strangelandian players. For Caroline, all of them are equally
 * strong, and she thinks that both of them can win a Strangelandian derby with
 * 50-percent probability.
 *
 * Help Caroline write a program which calculates the probability that a
 * Strangelandian player will win the tournament.
 * Input
 *
 * The first line of the input contains a single integer T, the number of test
 * cases (no more than 20). Each test case is described by exactly two lines.
 * The first of these lines contains three space-separated integers N, M and P
 * (2 ≤ N ≤ 230, N = 2K for some integer K, 1 ≤ M ≤ 10000, M ≤ N, 0 ≤ P ≤ 100)
 * -- the total number of players in the tournament, the number of competing
 * Strangelandian players and the probability that a Strangelandian player beats
 * a non-Strangelandian player in percents, respectively. The second of these
 * lines contains M space-separated distinct integers Ai (1 ≤ Ai ≤ N), the
 * 1-based positions of Strangelandian players in the tournament draw.
 * Output
 *
 * For each test case output exactly one line containing the required
 * probability in percents. Your answer will be considered correct if its
 * absolute error doesn't exceed 10-6.
 * Example
 *
 * Input:
 * 4
 * 2 1 42
 * 1
 * 4 2 66
 * 1 2
 * 4 2 66
 * 1 3
 * 8 3 71
 * 3 5 2
 *
 * Output:
 * 42.00000000000000
 * 66.00000000000000
 * 73.18080000000000
 * 75.47784648840000
