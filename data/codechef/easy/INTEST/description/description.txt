The purpose of this problem is to verify whether the method you are using to read input data is sufficiently fast to handle problems branded with the enormous Input/Output warning. You are expected to be able to process at least 2.5MB of input data per second at runtime.


Input
The input begins with two positive integers n k (n, k â‰¤ 10^7). The next n lines of input contain one positive integer ti, not greater than 10^9, each.


Output
Write a single integer to output, denoting how many integers ti are divisible by k.


Example

Input:
7 3
1
51
966369
7
9
999996
11

Output:
4
