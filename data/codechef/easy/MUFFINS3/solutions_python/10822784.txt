#in case n is odd (eg n=11) then making packets of size n/2+1 will give max remaining cupcakes (here, =11/2+1=6 packet size and 11 pancakes so 1 packet will be made of 6 pancakes and 5 pancakes for eating.
#in case n is even (eg. n=10) then for max remaining pancakes, packet size=n/2+1 again, here, 10/2+1=6, so 4 pancakes left
#so in each case no. of pancakes available for eating=n-(n/2+1)=n-pack_size, where pack_size=size of muffin packet for max remaining. this must not be =0; if =0 (eg. n=2=>n/2+1=2=pack_size so n-pack_size=0) then print n

t=int(raw_input())
for i in range(t):
    n=int(raw_input())

    if n-pack_size==0:
        print n #actually also=n/2+1=pack_size so no if reqd. Just for convenience
