Write a program to check whether a triangle is valid or not, when the three angles of the triangle  are the inputs. A triangle is valid if the sum of all the three angles is equal to 180 degress.


Input

The first line contains an integer T, total number of testcases. Then follow T lines, each line contains three angles  A, B and C of triangle separated by space.


Output
Display 'YES' or 'NO' if the triangle is Valid or not respectively.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
40 ≤ A,B,C ≤ 180
