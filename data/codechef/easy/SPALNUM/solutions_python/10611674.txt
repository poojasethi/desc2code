#Sum of palindromic numbers - SPALNUM
'''
A number is called palindromic if its decimal representation is a palindrome.
You are given a range, described by a pair of integers L and R.
Find the sum of all palindromic numbers lying in the range [L, R], inclusive of both the extrema.

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
The description of T test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a pair of space separated integers L and R denoting
the range for which you are required to find the sum of the palindromic numbers.

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing the sum of all the palindromic numbers
in the given range.

Constraints

1 <= T <= 100
Subtask 1 (34 points) : 1 <= L <= R <= 103
Subtask 2 (66 points) : 1 <= L <= R <= 105
Example

Input:
2
1 10
123 150

Output:
