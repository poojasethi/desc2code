You are given a sequence a1, a2, ..., aN. Find the smallest possible value of ai + aj, where 1 ≤ i < j ≤ N.

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. 
The first line of each description consists of a single integer N.
The second line of each description contains N space separated integers - a1, a2, ..., aN respectively.


Output
For each test case, output a single line containing a single integer - the smallest possible sum for the corresponding test case.

Constraints


T = 10^5, N = 2 : 13 points.
T = 10^5, 2 ≤ N ≤ 10 : 16 points.
T = 1000, 2 ≤ N ≤ 100 : 31 points.
T = 10, 2 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 : 40 points.
1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^6


Example
Input:
1
4
5 1 3 4

Output:
4

 

Explanation
Here we pick a2 and a3. Their sum equals to 1 + 3 = 4.
