Sereja have N programs. Sereja should run every program on two computers. Program number i works A[i] seconds on first computer and B[i] seconds on second. On each computer Sereja isn't able to run two programs in parallel, also Sereja isn't able to run one program on two computers in one moment. Sereja need to run all programs on both computers in minimal time. Help Sereja in his problem.

Input
First line contain integer T number of test cases. T tests follow. First line of each test case contain integer N. Next N lines contain integers A[i], B[i].
 

Output
For each test case output optimal time in separated line. On the next N lines. In i-th line output pair of numbers X, Y X - start of working program number i on first computer, j - the same information for second computer.
 

Constraints

1 ≤ Sum of N over all the test cases ≤  200000 
1 ≤ N ≤  10000 
1 ≤ A[i], B[i] ≤  100000
