Given two integers N and M, find how many permutations of 1, 2, ..., N (first N natural numbers) are there where the sum of every two adjacent numbers is at most M.

Input
First line of the input contains an integer T which is the number of test cases. Each of the following T lines contain two integers N and M.

Output
For each test case output a single one line containing number of such permutations modulo 1000000007.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100000(10^5)
2 ≤ N ≤ 1000000(10^6)
N < M < 2*N


Example
Input:
2
4 5
5 8
Output:
4
72

Explanation
For the 1st case all permutations are:  {2,3,1,4},    {3,2,1,4}, {4,1,2,3}  and {4,1,3,2}.
