In mathematical terms, the sequence F[N] of Fibonacci numbers is defined by the recurrence relation F[N] = F[N-1] + F[N-2], with seed values F[1] = 1,F[2] = 1.
Today, Chef gives you a rooted tree, consisting of N nodes. At first, the node 1 is the root. The nodes are numbered from 1 to N, and each node has an integer that initially equals to 0. Then, Chef asks you to perform M queries. 
The queries are as follows:



A x y

Add F[1] to the integer, associated with the node x, then add F[2] to the integer, associated with the second node on the way from x to y, then add F[3] to the integer, associated with the third node on the way from x to y, and so on. As you know, there is only one simple path from x to y.



QS x y

Let node x be the root of the tree, output the sum of all integers, associated with the nodes in the subtree of the node y, modulo 1000000009(10^9+9).



QC x y

Output the sum of all the integers, associated with the nodes on the way from x to y, modulo 1000000009(10^9+9).



R x

All the integers associated with the nodes return to the state after the x-th query. If x is 0, then all of them become equal to 0, as in the very beginning.


 

Input

The first line of the input consists of two space separated intergers - N and M respectively.
Then, N-1 lines follow. These N-1 lines describe the tree structure. Each line consists of two intergers - x and y, and that means that there is an edge between the node x and the node y.
Then, M lines follow. Every single line denotes a single query, which has one of the following forms: (See the sample for the detailed explanation)


A x1 y




QS x1 y




QC x1 y




R x1


As you can see, the number x isn't given to you directly. For all queries, actual number x will be equal to x1 xor lastans, where lastans denotes the last number that you have output, or 0 if you haven't output any numbers yet.

 

Output

For each query of the type QS or QC, output the answer modulo 10^9+9

 

Constraints


1 ≤ N, M ≤ 100000


1 ≤ x, y ≤ N

Explanation

Let’s denote the first state of integers as 0 0 0 0 0, where the i-th interger means the integer associated with the node i.
In the first query “A 4 2”, the actual number is x = 4 xor 0 = 4. Hence the state will be 2 3 1 1 0 after this query.
After the second query “A 2 5”, the state will be 3 4 3 1 3 for the similar reason.
In the next query, the answer is 3+4+3+3=13.
In the next query, the actual number is x = 12 xor 13 = 1, the answer is 3+3+1=7.
In the query “R 6”, the actual number is x = 6 xor 7 = 1, the state will be roll backed to 2 3 1 1 0.
At last, the actual number is x = 6 xor 7 = 1, the answer is 2+1+1=4.
