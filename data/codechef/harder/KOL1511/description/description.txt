Given N, A and B, find the value of the following expression:

Since the value can be large, find it modulo (10^9+7).

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
Each test case consists of a single line containing three space-separated integers — A, B, and N.


Output

For each test case, output a single line containing the value of the expression modulo 10^9+7.


Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 20
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^9
1 ≤ B < A ≤ 10^9
GCD(A,B) = 1, i.e., A and B are coprime.


Example
Input:
2
3 2 2
2 1 2

Output:
8
6

Explanation
Example case 1.The summation expands to gcd(1,1) + gcd(5,1) + gcd(1,5) + gcd(5,5) = 8.
Example case 2.The summation expands to gcd(1,1) + gcd(3,1) + gcd(1,3) + gcd(3,3) = 6.
