You are given a tree (an acyclic undirected connected graph) with n nodes. The tree nodes are numbered from 1 to n. Each node has a color, white or black. All the nodes are black initially. We will ask you to perfrom some instructions of the following form:

0 u: ask for how many nodes are connected to u, two nodes are connected if all the node on the path from u to v (inclusive u and v) have the same color.
1 u: toggle the color of u (that is, from black to white, or from white to black).


Input
The first line contains a number n that denotes the number of nodes in the tree (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). In each of the following n-1 lines, there will be two numbers (u, v) that describes an edge of the tree (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n). The next line contains a number m denoting number of operations we are going to process (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5). Each of the following m lines describe an operation (t, u) as we mentioned above(0 ≤ t ≤ 1, 1 ≤ u ≤ n).

Output
For each query operation, output the corresponding result.
