You are given n discs on plane, of the same radius (reach disc.

Input
First, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10, the number of tests. Each testcase is of the following form: 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, then n pairs of floating point coordinates follow: -1000 ≤ xi,yi ≤ 1000, representing the location of the i-th disc.

Output
For each testcase, output the total area covered by the intersection of all discs. Round the answer to 6 decimal digits after the point.

Example
Input:
1
2
0 0
0 1

Output:
1.228370
