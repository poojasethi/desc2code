Dai Ma Chu Shi is a Chinese CodeChef.
He recently got a huge chocolate with the size 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × n. (Yes, in five-dimensional space).
He wants to cut it into 8n pieces of small chocolate of size 1 × 1 × 1 × 1 × 2 each. Please notice that the direction doesn't matter, 1 × 1 × 1 × 2 × 1 and 2 × 1 × 1 × 1 × 1  are acceptable.

He wants to know how many ways he can achieve this feat in. Because the answer is very large, please tell him the answer modulo 10^9+7.

Input
First line of input contain a single integer T, the number of test cases. T tests follow. Each test case contain a single integer n.

Output
For each test case output a single line containing the answer for the problem modulo 10^9+7.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9
Example
Input:
1
1

Output:
272

Explanation
I have discovered a truly marvellous enumeration of this, which this margin is too narrow to contain.
