Give a string s of length l, and a set S of n sample string(s). We do reduce the string s using the set S by this way:

Wherever Si appears as a consecutive substring of the string s, you can delete (or not) it.
After each deletion, you will get a new string s by joining the part to the left and to the right of the deleted substring.


Request
By that way, try to reduce the given string s to get a new string of minimum length. You can do delete for unlimited times.

Input


The first line contains the string s.
The second line contains the integer n.
Within the last n lines, the i-th line contains the string Si.


Output
Output on a single line an integer which is the minimum length found.

Example
Input:

aaabccd
3
abc
ac
aaa

Output:

2


Limitations


0<l≤250
0<n≤30
0<|Si|≤20
