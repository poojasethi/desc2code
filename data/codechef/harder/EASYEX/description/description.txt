One day Chef had an exam on probability theory. Nothing interesting, but the exam was going fishily easy. And finally Chef got to the last question: "Suppose you have a dice with K faces with  numbers from 1 to K written on it, and integers L and F(0 < L <= K). You roll it N times. Let ai be the number of times (out of the N rolls) that a face with number i written on it came up as the top face of the dice. Find the mathematical expectation of the value a1^F * a2^F * ... * aL^F."  "I'll drop out of university and won't be allowed to cook" - Chef is frightened! Help him now or he will never be able to please you with tasty dishes again.

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each of the following T lines describe one test case and contain 4 space-separated integers N, K, L and F.

Output
Let the answer for a test case be an fraction P / Q, where P and Q are integers. Let integer X be P * Q^-1 modulo 2003, where Q^-1 modulo 2003 is the modular multiplicative inverse of Q modulo 2003 or 0 if Q^-1 modulo 2003 doesn't exist. For each test case, output a single line containing the integer X for this test case.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 50
0 < N, K ≤ 10^9
0 < F ≤ 1000 
0 < L * F ≤ 50 000

Input
1
2 6 2 1

Output:
779


Explanation
We roll the 6-face dice 2 times, and we are interested in the value  a1 * a2. The only two possible scenarios when this value is not zero are (1, 2) and (2, 1). Both of them have a1 * a2 = 1 and happen with probability 1 / 36 each. It means that P / Q = (1 + 1) / 36 = 1 / 18, so the answer is, X = 779.
