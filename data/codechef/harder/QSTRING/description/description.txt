You have been given a string T with n lowercase letters T[1..n]. For each substrings T[l..r], we can assign them two values, k1 and k2, which are defined as following.

k1 is the number of different substrings which are lexicographically smaller than T[l..r]. There are (n + 1) * n / 2 substrings in total.
k2 indicates the number of substrings which are as same as T[l..r] but have smaller left subscript than l.


In this problem, you need to answer the following two queries:


Select k1 k2: report l and r, such that T[l..r] are assigned values k1 and k2.
Rank l r: output the assigned k1 and k2 of T[l..r].


Input

The first line contains a string T with n letters . The second line contains a number m, which represents for the totally number of queries.


Each of the following m lines contains a query. All queries are formed as "Select k1 k2" or "Rank l r".


Output
For each query, output the corresponding answer as the form "l r" or "k1 k2" in a single line.

Constraints

1 <= n <= 10^6
1 <= m <= 10^6
1 <= l <= r <= n
k1, k2 are legal
.


Example
Input:
