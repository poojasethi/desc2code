Hey, you've got a new mission! This time your client ask you to write a editor and it should run fast! However the client's request is somehow strange, but they give a lot of money so your boss ask you to finish it as fast as possible.
This editor deal with a string S. And the length |S| of the string S would never be smaller than 10. This editor must support the following 7 operations quickly. Here the string would be indexed starting at 0.

INSERT_LEFT c : insert character c at the beginning of S
INSERT_RIGHT c : insert character c at the end of S
INSERT_MIDDLE c : insert character c at the middle of S (before the (|S| div 2)-th character)
DELETE_LEFT : delete the first character of S
DELETE_RIGHT : delete the last character of S
DELETE_MIDDLE : delete the middle character of S (the (|S| div 2)-th character)
QUERY q : print how many times the string q occur in S. (overlap is allowed)

Here div means integer division, that is, |S| div 2 = floor(|S| / 2).

Input
The first line of input contains the initial string SInit. The second line contains one integer Q, denoting the number of operations. Then each of the next Q lines contains an operation with the format mentioned above.

Output
For each QUERY operation, print the answer in a line.

Constraints

1 ≤ Q ≤ 150000 (1.5 * 10^5)
|SInit| = 10
SInit, q contain only lower Latin letters ('a'-'z').
c is a lower Latin letter ('a'-'z').
The total length of the string q over all the queries does not exceed 1500000 (1.5 * 10^6).
The DELETE_LEFT, DELETE_RIGHT, DELETE_MIDDLE operations do not appear when |S| = 10.


Example

Input:
bbabaaaaab
12
INSERT_MIDDLE b
INSERT_LEFT b
INSERT_MIDDLE b
INSERT_MIDDLE b
INSERT_RIGHT a
INSERT_LEFT a
INSERT_MIDDLE b
INSERT_LEFT a
INSERT_MIDDLE a
QUERY bbaaa
DELETE_MIDDLE
DELETE_MIDDLE

Output:
1

Explanation
In the sample, the string |S| will be changed as follows:

bbabaaaaab (SInit)
bbababaaaab (after INSERT_MIDDLE b)
bbbababaaaab (after INSERT_LEFT b)
bbbababbaaaab (after INSERT_MIDDLE b)
bbbababbbaaaab (after INSERT_MIDDLE b)
bbbababbbaaaaba (after INSERT_RIGHT a)
abbbababbbaaaaba (after INSERT_LEFT a)
abbbababbbbaaaaba (after INSERT_MIDDLE b)
aabbbababbbbaaaaba (after INSERT_LEFT a)
aabbbabababbbaaaaba (after INSERT_MIDDLE a)
aabbbababbbbaaaaba (after DELETE_MIDDLE)
aabbbababbbaaaaba (after DELETE_MIDDLE)
For QUERY bbaaa, this string occurs once. It is shown in boldface type.
