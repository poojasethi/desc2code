Given an directed graph with N nodes (numbered from 1 to N) and M edges, calculate the number of unordered pairs (X, Y) such there exist two paths, one from node 1 to node X, and another one from node 1 to node Y, such that they don't share any node except node 1. 

Input
There is only one test case in one test file.
The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers N, M. Each of the next M lines contains two space separated integers  u, v denoting a directed edge of graph G, from node u to node v. There are no multi-edges and self loops in the graph.


Output
Print a single integer corresponding to the number of unordered pairs as asked in the problem.. 

Constraints and Example
Input:
6 6
1 2
1 3
1 4
2 5
2 6
3 6

Output:
14

Explanation
There are 14 pairs of vertices as follows: 
	(1,2) 
	(1,3) 
	(1,4) 
	(1,5)  
	(1,6) 
	(2,3) 
	(2,4) 
	(2,6) 
	(3,4) 
	(3,5) 
	(3,6) 
	(4,5) 
	(4,6) 
	(5,6)
