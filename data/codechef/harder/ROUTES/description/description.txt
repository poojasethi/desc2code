Alice is the queen of ChefLand. She has initiated a road reform recently. The reform will last for M days.
Initially, there are N towns and no roads in ChefLand. Every day one bidirectional road will be built. On the i-th day, the road connecting the towns Ai and Bi will be built.
Nevertheless, Alice worries that if there is a road that will occur in every route from the town A to the town B for some pair of towns A and B, criminals might attack everyone who is traveling from the town A to the town B (or vice versa) for sure. So she calls such an unordered pair (A, B) unsafe.
You are given a plan of the road reform. Please, output the number of unsafe unordered pairs of towns, after each of M days.

Input
The first line of input consists of the numbers N and M - the number of towns and the number of days.
The following M lines will describe the road reform. The i-th line will contain two integers X Y. That means that the bidirectional road, connecting the towns X and Y will be built during the i-th day. 

Output
Output M lines. The i-th line should contain the number of unsafe pairs of towns after the i-th day.

Example
Input:
