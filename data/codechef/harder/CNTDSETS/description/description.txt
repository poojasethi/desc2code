Chef likes points located at integer coordinates in a space having N dimensions. In particular, he likes sets of such points having diameter exactly equal to D (called D-sets). The diameter of a set of points is the maximum distance between any pair of points in the set. The distance between two points (a1,a2,...,aN) and (b1,b2,...,bN) is max{|a1-b1|, |a2-b2|, ..., |aN-bN|}.


Chef would like to know how many D-sets exist. However, he soon realized that, without any extra constraints, there is an infinite number of D-sets. Thus, he would only like to count the number of classes of D-sets, such that any two D-sets which belong to the same class are equivalent under translation. To be more precise, two D-sets X and Y are considered equivalent (and belong to the same class) if:

they contain the same number of points AND
there exists a tuple of N integer numbers (t1, ..., tN) such that by translating each point of X by the amount ti in dimension i (1≤i≤N) we obtain the set of points Y.


Let's consider N=2, D=4 and the following sets of points X={(1,2), (5,5), (4,3)} and Y={(2,5), (5,6), (6,8)}. Let's consider now the tuple (1,3). By translating each point of X by the amounts specified by this tuple we obtain the set {(2,5), (6,8), (5,6)}, which is exactly the set Y. Thus, the two sets X and Y are equivalent and belong to the same class.


Help Chef find the number of classes of D-sets modulo 1000000007 (10^9+7).


Input
The first line of input contains the number of test cases T. Each of the next T lines contains two space-separated integers describing a test case: N and D.

Output
For each test case (in the order given in the input), output the number of classes of D-sets modulo 1000000007.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ N ≤ 1000
1 ≤ D ≤ 1000000000  (10^9)


Example
Input:
5
1 10
2 1
2 10
3 1
3 3
 

Output:
512
9
498134775
217
548890725
 

Explanation
Example case 1:
When N=1 all the points are arranged in a line. In order to have a diameter equal to 10 each D-set must contain two points at distance 10. Between two such points there may be up to 9 points which may belong to the D-set or not. Thus, there are 2^9 classes of D-sets.

Example case 2:
There are 9 classes of D-sets. One D-set from each class is given below:

{(0,0), (0,1)}
{(0,0), (1,0)}
{(0,0), (1,1)}
{(0,1), (1,0)}
{(0,0), (0,1), (1,0)}
{(0,0), (0,1), (1,1)}
{(0,0), (1,0), (1,1)}
{(0,1), (1,0), (1,1)}
{(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)}
