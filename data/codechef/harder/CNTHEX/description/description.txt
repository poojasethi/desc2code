Dexter wants to make a hexagon by using six sticks for sides from a collection of sticks of lengths 1, 2, 3, ... N. Dexter will only make valid hexagons whose area is strictly positive.
He considers a hexagon "good" if the biggest stick has  length at least L and lengths of all the other sticks are not more than X.  A "good" hexagon does not have sticks of the same length more than K times. 
How many ways he can make a "good" hexagon?
For example, when N=8, L=7, X=5, K=3: { 1,2,2,5,5,7 } is a good hexagon but {1,2,2,2,2,7}, { 1,2,3,4,5,6},{1,2,3,4,6,7} are not .
Two hexagons are considered different if their side length sets are different. For example {1,2,3,4,5,6} , {1,1,1,2,2,3} and {1,1,2,2,2,3} are all different 
hexagons. But {1,2,3,4,5,6} and { 2,4,6,1,3,5} are not different.

Input
 Input contains four integers N( 2 <= N <= 10^9) , L ( 2 <= L <= N and N-L<=100) ,  X(  1<=X< L ) and K ( 1 <=  K <= 5) .

Output
 Output the number of different ways to make a "good" hexagon % 1000000007.
