Mark is a taxi driver working in a big city. A taxi company, where Mark works, has N regular customers. The house of a regular customer can be described as a point of the Cartesian plane with non-negative integer coordinates. Recently, Mark's boss has given him a big assignment: he should drive between each pair of regular customers to make sure all the direct roads between the customers are in a good condition. Now Mark is wondering how big the total distance he will be driving during this assignment is.
More formally, you are given a sequence p1, p2, ..., pN of points of the Cartesian plane with non-negative integer coordinates. These points describe the houses of the regular customers. Also, you are given two positive integer parameters a and b. The distance between points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is equal to max(a × |x1 - x2|, b × |y1 - y2|).
You task is to calculate the sum of the distances between each pair of the given points.

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of the test case description contains one integer N denoting the size of the sequence. The second line contains two positive integers a and b.
Each of the next N lines contains two non-negative integers xi and yi denoting the coordinates of the corresponding point of the sequence.

Output
For each test case, output a single line containing one integer: the sum of the distances between each pair of the given points.
