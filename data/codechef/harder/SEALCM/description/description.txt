In this problem Sereja is interested in number of arrays A[1], A[2], ..., A[N] (1 ≤ A[i] ≤ M, A[i] - integer)
such that least common multiple (LCM) of all its elements is divisible by number D.


Please, find sum of answers to the problem with D = L, D = L+1, ..., D = R. As answer could be large, please output it modulo
(10^9 + 7).


Input
First line of input contain integer T - number of test cases. 
For each test case, only line of input contain four integers N, M, L, R.

Output
For each test case, output required sum modulo (10^9 + 7).

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ N ≤ 5*10^6
1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ M ≤ 1000


Example

Input:
2
5 5 1 5
5 5 4 5

Output:
12310
4202
