Chef has a string S. Initially, this string is empty. Also, Chef has a sequence of operations. Each operation is of one of the following two types:

add character to the end of the string S, so the length of S increases by 1.
delete the first character of S, so the length of S decreases by 1.

After each operation Chef asks you the number of distinct substrings of the current string S. Please answer his questions!


Input
The first line of input contains Q - the number of operations. Then Q lines follow, each of these lines describes the operation.

Add operation is of the form "+ C", where C is a lowercase English letter.
Delete operation is of the from "-".

It is guaranteed that after each operation, the length of S is a positive integer.


Output
Just to make the size of your output smaller, Chef asks you the sum of answers of all Q operations modulo 1000000007.
So, print a single integer - the sum of answers for all operations (the sum of Q numbers) modulo 1000000007.


Constraints

1 ≤ Q ≤ 1000000


Example
Input:
8
+ a
+ b
+ a
+ a
-
-
-
+ a

Output:
27
 

Explanation

In the first test case the string S transforms as follows: 

After the first operation S = a. The number of distinct substrings is 1: a.
After the second operation S = ab. The number of distinct substrings is 3: a, b, ab.
After the third operation S = aba. Answer is 5: a, b, ab, ba, aba.
After the fourth operation S = abaa. Answer is 8: a, b, ab, ba, aa, aba, baa, abaa.
After the fifth operation S = baa. Answer is 5: a, b, ba, aa, baa.
After the sixth operation S = aa. Answer is 2: a, aa.
After the seventh operation S = a. Answer is 1: a.
After the eighth operation S = aa. Answer is 2: a, aa.

The sum is 1 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 5 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 27, 27 modulo 1000000007 = 27, so, you should print 27.
