The binomial coefficient C(N, K) is defined as N! / K! / (N − K)! for 0 ≤ K ≤ N. Here N! = 1 * 2 * ... * N for N ≥ 1, and 0! = 1.
You are given integers n and R. You need to find the smallest K in the range {0, 1, ..., 2^n − 1}, for which C(2^n − 1, K) mod 2^n = R. Here A mod B denotes the remainder of the division of A by B. If no such K exists output -1.

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers n and R.

Output
For each test case output the answer on the separate line.

Constraints


1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ n ≤ 120
0 ≤ R < 2^n


Example

Input:
4
1 0
1 1
3 7
4 3

Output:
-1
0
1
7

Explanation
Example case 1. We have C(1, 0) = C(1, 1) = 1. Hence C(1, K) mod 2 ≠ 0 for all K. Therefore, the answer is -1.
Example case 2. Since C(1, 0) mod 2 = 1, the answer is 0.
Example case 3. Since C(7, 0) mod 8 = 1 ≠ 7 and C(7, 1) mod 8 = 7 mod 8 = 7, the answer is 1.
Example case 4. Here C(15, 7) mod 16 = 15! / 7! / 8! mod 16 = 6435 mod 16 = 3. It can be shown that for all smaller values of K we have C(15, K) mod 16 ≠ 3. Therefore, the answer is 7.
