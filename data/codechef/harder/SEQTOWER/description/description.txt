You are given an array A consisting of prime numbers greater than 4.

Fun( Sequence S )
{

        if ( S has only 1 element )    return A[S[1]]

        X = S[2...last element]

        return power( A[S[1]] , Fun(X) )

}

where power(A, B) returns A^B, and A is 1-indexed.
Fun(S) :
Now you need to find the sum of the values returned by Fun(S) for every distinct sequence S.
Each element of S is an integer from 1 to N. Thus, there are N^N possible sequences in all. As the values can be large, return it modulo M.

Input
First line contains T, the number of test cases to follow.
First line of each test case contains two space separated integers N and M.
Second line of the test case contains N (space separated) integers of the array A.

Output

For each test case, output the sum modulo M as explained above.


Constraints
There are two types of test files:
File Type 1:

2 ≤ N ≤ 100
2 ≤ M ≤ 500
1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
Ai is a prime number greater than 4 and less than 10^6.


File Type 2:

2 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
2 ≤ M ≤ 5000
T = 1 
Ai is a prime number greater than 4 and less than 10^6.



Example
Input:
4
2 23
7 11
4 89
5 7 13 11
4 90
5 5 5 5
4 100
5 11 7 17

Output:
10
