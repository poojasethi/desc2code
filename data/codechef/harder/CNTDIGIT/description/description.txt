You are given an integer N. For each pair of integers (L, R), where 1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ N you can find the number of distinct digits that appear in the decimal representation of at least one of the numbers L L+1 ... R.

Find the sum of all that numbers. Since the answer can be large, output it modulo 1000000007.


Input
The only line of the input contains a single integer N without leading zeros.

Output
Output the answer to the problem on the first line.

Constraints
