You are given a string S and N queries. Each query is defined by two integers - Li and Pi. Count the number of strings of the length Li that occur exactly Pi times (as the consecutive substrings) in the string S.

Input
The first line of input contains the string S.

The second line of input contains the integer N - the number of queries.
Then there are N lines, the i-th one contains numbers Li and Pi for the i-th query.

Output
For each query output the answer at the corresponding line of the output.

Constraints

1 ≤ |S| ≤ 50, 1 ≤ N ≤ 100 : 13 points.
1 ≤ |S| ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ N ≤ 10000 : 27 points.
1 ≤ |S| ≤ 200000, 1 ≤ N ≤ 500000 : 60 points.
1 ≤ Li, Pi ≤ N


Example
Input:
abacaba
1
3 2

Output:
1
 

Explanation
The only such string is aba.
