Sereja have N points, with coordinates (1, 0), (2, 0), ..., (N, 0). Every point has a color, point with coordinate (i, 0) has color A[i].
Sereja have painted arcs between every pair of points with same color. Formally Sereja painted arc between points (i, 0) and (j, 0) if A[i] = A[j] and i != j, such arc has color A[i]. All the arcs are painted such way that they will reside along the positive quadrant.
Now Sereja wants to know how many pairs of arc with different color intersect?

Input
 First line contain integer N. Next line contain integers A[1], A[2], ..., A[N].

Output
 In single line output answer modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7). 

Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 100000
1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 100000

 

Example
Input:
4
1 2 1 2

Output:
1
