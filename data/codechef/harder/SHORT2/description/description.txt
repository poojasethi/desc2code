Given a prime number p, find the number of pairs of integers (a, b) such that p < a, p < b and ab is divisible by (a-p)(b-p).


Input
The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 5). Then t test cases follow, each test case consists of a line containing one prime integer p (1 < p < 10^12).


Output
For each test case output one line containing the required number. It's guaranteed that this number won't exceed 2^63-1.


Example

Input:
3
2
23
59

Output:
14
80
116

Explanation:

In the first test case the sought pairs are (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,8), (4,3), (4,4), (4,6), (5,3), (5,12), (6,4), (6,8), (8,3), (8,6) and (12,5).
