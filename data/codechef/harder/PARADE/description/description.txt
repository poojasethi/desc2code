In the magic land, there is an annual parade hold on each spring.


There are N cities in magic land, and M directed roads between cities.

On the parade, there will be some(may be 0) heroes travel in this land, for each hero:
He start at city begin[i], traveling to some cities, and finish at city end[i]. Note that: begin[i] may be equals to end[i], but he must at least moved to another city during this travel. He can go on one road many times, but it will have a cost for each time.


The cost of this parade is the sum of these items:

1. The sum of costs by traveling on roads. (If a road is passed by k heroes, then it must be count k times.)

2. If for a hero, he ended at a city that not equals to his start city, i.e. begin[i] != end[i], then it will cost C dollars to move him back to his home.

3. If for a city, there is no heroes visited, then we must pay for the citizen C dollars as compensate.


The value of C may change every year, and we can predict this value in the following K years. 
Your task is: calculate the minimal cost of each year.


Input

In the first line, there are 3 integers: N, M and K.

In the following M lines:

there will be 3 integers: S[i], T[i], and V[i], describing a directed road from S[i] to T[i], cost V[i] dollars.

In the next K lines:
There will be an integer: C[i], describing the value of C in that year.


Output

Output K lines:
each line contain an integer, corresponding to the minimal cost of each year.

Constraints
2 ≤ N ≤ 250

1 ≤ M ≤ 30000

1 ≤ K ≤ 10000

S[i] != T[i], 1 ≤ S[i], T[i] ≤ N

1 ≤ V[i] ≤ 10000

1 ≤ C ≤ 10000

Note that: there may be more than 1 road between a certain pair of cities.


Example

Input:
6 5 3
1 3 2
2 3 2
3 4 2
4 5 2
4 6 2

Explanation

In the first year, since C is very small, an optimal solution is: no hero travel, we pay 1 dollar for each city as compensate.

In the second year, an optimal solution is: One hero traveling in the path: 1->3->4->5. We pay 2+2+2=6 dollars for the roads, 5 dollars for taking him back to city 1, and pay 5 dollars for city 2 and 6 as compensate.

In the third year, one optimal solution is: One hero traveling in the path: 1->3->4->5, and another hero traveling in the path: 2->3->4->6.
