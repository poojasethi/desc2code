You are given a sequence w of integers. A mismatch is any such pair of neighbouring elements of sequence w[i] and w[i+1], that w[i]>w[i+1]+1.
As long as there is any mismatch, you solve it by swapping the mismatching numbers. Given an input sequence, calculate one of the possible output mismatch-less sequences obtained by successively solving mistmatches by swapping.



Input
First - 1 ≤ t ≤ 10 - the number of tests. For each test: first - 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000. Then, n nonnegative integers.


Output
For each test, you should output exactly n integers.


Example

Input:
2
4
4 3 2 1
4
4 3 1 2

Output:
4 3 2 1
1 4 3 2
