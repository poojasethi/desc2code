In computer science, a treap is a binary search tree according to the keys and meanwhile a heap according to the weights. Follow the link for more details: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treap
Your task is to maintain a max-treap supporting the following operations:

0 k w: Insert a new node, whose key and weight are k and w.
1 k: Delete a node in the treap with key k.
2 ku kv: Return the distance between node u whose key is ku and node v whose key is kv.


No two nodes share the same key or the same weight in the tree, and we guarantee the node is indeed in the treap before a delete operation takes place.


Input
The first line contains an integer N, the number of operations.
Each of the next N lines contains two or three integers "0 k w" "1 k" or "2 ku kv” . These integers describe the current operation.


Output
For each distance query, print the distance between u and v.

Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 200000
0 < k, w, ku, kv  < 2^32
