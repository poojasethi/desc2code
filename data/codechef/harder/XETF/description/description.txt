Euler totient function (denoted by phi(N)) for a positive integer N is defined as number of positive integers less than or equal  N that are coprime to N
Let's generalize this concept of Euler totient function. For positive integer N let's write out the integers that are less than or equal to N and are coprime to N. We'll get a list of integers of the form A1, A2, ..., AM, where M = phi(N). Let's denote EK(N) = A1^K + A2^K+...+AM^K. This way we obtain something more general version of Euler totient function, in particular, E0(N) = phi(N) for every positive integer N.
Your task is to calculate EK(N). As answer could be large, print your answer modulo 10^9+7 

Input
 The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers N and K.

Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the answer to the problem i.e. the value of EK(N) modulo 10^9+7.

Constraints


1 ≤ T ≤ 128

Example
Input:
2
10 1
7 0

Output:
20
6

Explanation
Example case 1. The numbers that are coprime to 10 are 1, 3, 7, 9. Their sum is 20.
Example case 2. 7 is a prime number, so any integer that is less than 7 is coprime to it.
