Sereja call two arrays A and B with length n almost equal if for every i (1 <= i <= n) CA(A[i]) = CB(B[i]). CX[x] equal to number of index j (1 <=j <= n) such that X[j] < x.
 
For two permutations P1 and P2 Sereja found new function F(P1, P2) that is equal to number of pairs (l,r) (1 <= l <= r <= n) such that P1[l..r] is almost equal to P2[l..r] and array P1[l..r] contain not more then E inversions. 
 
Now Sereja is insterested in next question: what is the sum F(P1,P2) by all possible permutations P1, P2 from n elements.
 

Input
First line contain integer T - number of testcases. T tests follow. The only line of each testcase contain integers n, E.

Output
For each testcase output answer modulo 1000000007 (10^9+7).
 

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10000
1 ≤ n ≤ 500
1 ≤ E ≤ 1000000
