Given an initially empty integer array (1-indexed) and some queries:

Type 0: Add the integer number x at the end of the array. 
Type 1: On the interval L..R find a number y, to maximize (x xor y).
Type 2: Delete last k numbers in the array
Type 3: On the interval L..R, count the number of integers less than or equal to x.
Type 4: On the interval L..R, find the kth smallest integer (kth order statistic).


Input

The first line contains a single integer M denoting number of queries. 
The following M lines contain queries, form of queries is as follows.
Query type 0 has the form "0 x". 
Query type 1 has the form "1 L R x". 
Query type 2 has the form "2 k". 
Query type 3 has the form "3 L R x". 
Query type 4 has the form "4 L R k". 

Note that, there will be no invalid query in the input.

Output
For each Query of type 1, 3 and 4 output the result in a single line.

Constraints

Let N denote numbers of elements in before executing the query.
1 ≤ M ≤ 5 * 10^5
1 ≤ x ≤ 5 * 10^5^
1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ N
 For query type 2, 1 ≤ k ≤ N	 and for query type 4, k ≤ R-L+1
