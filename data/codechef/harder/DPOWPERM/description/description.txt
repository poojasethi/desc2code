Let N be a positive integer and S = {1, 2, 3, ..., N}. For a given positive integer d the function f : S --> S is called d-power permutation if there exists a bijection g : S --> S such that g ( g ( ... g ( x ) ... ) ) = f(x) for each x from S , where g is repeated exactly d times.

You are given some bijection f : S --> S and a positive integer D. You need to find the number of those d <= D such that f is d-power permutation.


Input
 The first line contains a single positive integer T <= 10, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains two positive integers N and D, where N <= 700 and D <= 10^18. The second line contains N space-separated integers. i^th number in the second line is the value f(i). It is guaranteed that f is bijection from S onto S.


Output
 For each test case, output a single line containing the answer for the corresponding test case.


Example

Input:
2
3 6
1 2 3
5 10
2 1 4 5 3

Output:
6
3


Explanation
In the second case the appropriate values of d is 1, 5 and 7.
