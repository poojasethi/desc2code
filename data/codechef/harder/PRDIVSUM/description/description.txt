For a given positive integer N find the number of all pairs (a, b) of positive integers such that 1 <= a < b <= N and the sum a + b divides the product a * b.


Input
 The first line contains a single positive integer T <= 5, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The only line of each test case contains a positive integer N <= 10^9.


Output
 For each test case, output a single line containing the answer for the corresponding test case.


Example

Input:
2
2
15

Output:
0
4



Explanation
In the second test case required pairs are (3, 6), (4, 12), (6, 12) and (10, 15).
