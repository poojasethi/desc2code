Caisa is now at home and his son has a simple task for him.
Given a rooted tree with †n‡ vertices, numbered from 1 to †n‡ (vertex 1 is the root). Each vertex of the tree has a value. You should answer †q‡ queries. Each query is one of the following:
  Format of the query is "1 †v‡". Let's write out the sequence of vertices along the path from the root to vertex †v‡: †u‡1, †u‡2, ..., †u‡†k‡ (†u‡1 = 1; †u‡†k‡ = †v‡). You need to output such a vertex †u‡†i‡ that †gcd‡(†value‡ †of‡ †u‡†i‡, †value‡ †of‡ †v‡) > 1 and †i‡ < †k‡. If there are several possible vertices †u‡†i‡ pick the one with maximum value of †i‡. If there is no such vertex output -1.  Format of the query is "2 †v‡ †w‡". You must change the value of vertex †v‡ to †w‡. You are given all the queries, help Caisa to solve the problem.

Input
The first line contains two space-separated integers †n‡, †q‡ (1 ≤ †n‡, †q‡ ≤ 10^5). 
The second line contains †n‡ integers †a‡1, †a‡2, ..., †a‡†n‡ (1 ≤ †a‡†i‡ ≤ 2·10^6), where †a‡†i‡ represent the value of node †i‡.
Each of the next †n‡ - 1 lines contains two integers †x‡†i‡ and †y‡†i‡ (1 ≤ †x‡†i‡, †y‡†i‡ ≤ †n‡; †x‡†i‡ ≠ †y‡†i‡), denoting the edge of the tree between vertices †x‡†i‡ and †y‡†i‡.
Each of the next †q‡ lines contains a query in the format that is given above. For each query the following inequalities hold: 1 ≤ †v‡ ≤ †n‡ and 1 ≤ †w‡ ≤ 2·10^6. Note that: there are no more than 50 queries that changes the value of a vertex.

Output
For each query of the first type output the result of the query.
