The Smart Beaver from ABBYY invented a new message encryption method and now wants to check its performance. Checking it manually is long and tiresome, so he decided to ask the ABBYY Cup contestants for help.
A message is a sequence of †n‡ integers †a‡1, †a‡2, ..., †a‡†n‡. Encryption uses a key which is a sequence of †m‡ integers †b‡1, †b‡2, ..., †b‡†m‡ (†m‡ ≤ †n‡). All numbers from the message and from the key belong to the interval from 0 to †c‡ - 1, inclusive, and all the calculations are performed modulo †c‡.
Encryption is performed in †n‡ - †m‡ + 1 steps. On the first step we add to each number †a‡1, †a‡2, ..., †a‡†m‡ a corresponding number †b‡1, †b‡2, ..., †b‡†m‡. On the second step we add to each number †a‡2, †a‡3, ..., †a‡†m‡ + 1 (changed on the previous step) a corresponding number †b‡1, †b‡2, ..., †b‡†m‡. And so on: on step number †i‡ we add to each number †a‡†i‡, †a‡†i‡ + 1, ..., †a‡†i‡ + †m‡ - 1 a corresponding number †b‡1, †b‡2, ..., †b‡†m‡. The result of the encryption is the sequence †a‡1, †a‡2, ..., †a‡†n‡ after †n‡ - †m‡ + 1 steps.
Help the Beaver to write a program that will encrypt messages in the described manner.

Input
The first input line contains three integers †n‡, †m‡ and †c‡, separated by single spaces. 
The second input line contains †n‡ integers †a‡†i‡ (0 ≤ †a‡†i‡ < †c‡), separated by single spaces — the original message. 
The third input line contains †m‡ integers †b‡†i‡ (0 ≤ †b‡†i‡ < †c‡), separated by single spaces — the encryption key.
The input limitations for getting 30 points are: 
  1 ≤ †m‡ ≤ †n‡ ≤ 10^3  1 ≤ †c‡ ≤ 10^3  The input limitations for getting 100 points are: 
  1 ≤ †m‡ ≤ †n‡ ≤ 10^5  1 ≤ †c‡ ≤ 10^3 
Output
Print †n‡ space-separated integers — the result of encrypting the original message.

Examples
Input
4 3 2
1 1 1 1
1 1 1

Output
0 1 1 0

Output
0 1 2


Note
In the first sample the encryption is performed in two steps: after the first step †a‡ = (0, 0, 0, 1) (remember that the calculations are performed modulo 2), after the second step †a‡ = (0, 1, 1, 0), and that is the answer.
