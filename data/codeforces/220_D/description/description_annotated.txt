The Little Elephant is playing with the Cartesian coordinates' system. Most of all he likes playing with integer points. The Little Elephant defines an integer point as a pair of integers (†x‡; †y‡), such that 0 ≤ †x‡ ≤ †w‡ and 0 ≤ †y‡ ≤ †h‡. Thus, the Little Elephant knows only (†w‡ + 1)·(†h‡ + 1) distinct integer points.
The Little Elephant wants to paint a triangle with vertexes at integer points, the triangle's area must be a positive integer. For that, he needs to find the number of groups of three points that form such triangle. At that, the order of points in a group matters, that is, the group of three points (0;0), (0;2), (2;2) isn't equal to the group (0;2), (0;0), (2;2).
Help the Little Elephant to find the number of groups of three integer points that form a nondegenerate triangle with integer area.

Input
A single line contains two integers †w‡ and †h‡ (1 ≤ †w‡, †h‡ ≤ 4000).

Output
In a single output line print an integer — the remainder of dividing the answer to the problem by 1000000007 (10^9 + 7).
