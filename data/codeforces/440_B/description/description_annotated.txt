Petya has †k‡ matches, placed in †n‡ matchboxes lying in a line from left to right. We know that †k‡ is divisible by †n‡. Petya wants all boxes to have the same number of matches inside. For that, he can move a match from its box to the adjacent one in one move. How many such moves does he need to achieve the desired configuration?

Input
The first line contains integer †n‡ (1 ≤ †n‡ ≤ 50000). The second line contains †n‡ non-negative numbers that do not exceed 10^9, the †i‡-th written number is the number of matches in the †i‡-th matchbox. It is guaranteed that the total number of matches is divisible by †n‡.

Output
Print the total minimum number of moves.
