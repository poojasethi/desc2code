Petya loves lucky numbers. We all know that lucky numbers are the positive integers whose decimal representations contain only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not.
Petya wonders eagerly what minimum lucky number has the sum of digits equal to †n‡. Help him cope with the task.
