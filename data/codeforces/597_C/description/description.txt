For the given sequence with n different elements find the number of increasing subsequences with k + 1 elements. It is guaranteed that the answer is not greater than 8·10^18.

Input
First line contain two integer values n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ k ≤ 10) — the length of sequence and the number of elements in increasing subsequences.
Next n lines contains one integer ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ n) each — elements of sequence. All values ai are different.

Output
Print one integer — the answer to the problem.
