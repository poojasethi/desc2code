When Xellos was doing a practice course in university, he once had to measure the intensity of an effect that slowly approached equilibrium. A good way to determine the equilibrium intensity would be choosing a sufficiently large number of consecutive data points that seems as constant as possible and taking their average. Of course, with the usual sizes of data, it's nothing challenging — but why not make a similar programming contest problem while we're at it?
You're given a sequence of †n‡ data points †a‡1, ..., †a‡†n‡. There aren't any big jumps between consecutive data points — for each 1 ≤ †i‡ < †n‡, it's guaranteed that |†a‡†i‡ + 1 - †a‡†i‡| ≤ 1.
A range [†l‡, †r‡] of data points is said to be almost constant if the difference between the largest and the smallest value in that range is at most 1. Formally, let †M‡ be the maximum and †m‡ the minimum value of †a‡†i‡ for †l‡ ≤ †i‡ ≤ †r‡; the range [†l‡, †r‡] is almost constant if †M‡ - †m‡ ≤ 1.
Find the length of the longest almost constant range.

Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer †n‡ (2 ≤ †n‡ ≤ 100 000) — the number of data points.
The second line contains †n‡ integers †a‡1, †a‡2, ..., †a‡†n‡ (1 ≤ †a‡†i‡ ≤ 100 000).

Output
Print a single number — the maximum length of an almost constant range of the given sequence.

Examples
Input
5
1 2 3 3 2

Output
4

Input
11
5 4 5 5 6 7 8 8 8 7 6

Output
5


Note
In the first sample, the longest almost constant range is [2, 5]; its length (the number of data points in it) is 4.
In the second sample, there are three almost constant ranges of length 4: [1, 4], [6, 9] and [7, 10]; the only almost constant range of the maximum length 5 is [6, 10].
