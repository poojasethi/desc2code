You are given numbers †a‡ and †b‡. Calculate the sum of †a‡ and reverse of †b‡. A reverse of a number is a number which contains the same digits in reverse order. For example, reverse of 230 is 32, and reverse of 0 is 0.

Input
The input contains two integers †a‡ and †b‡ (0 ≤ †a‡, †b‡ ≤ 10^9), separated by a single space. The numbers are given without leading zeros.

Output
Output the sum of †a‡ and reverse of †b‡.
