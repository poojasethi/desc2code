You are given an equation †A‡ * †X‡ + †B‡ * †Y‡ = †C‡, †A‡, †B‡, †C‡ are positive integer coefficients, †X‡ and †Y‡ are variables which can have positive integer values only. Output the number of solutions of this equation and the solutions themselves.

Input
The only line of input contains integers †A‡, †B‡ and †C‡ (1 ≤ †A‡, †B‡, †C‡ ≤ 1000), separated with spaces.

Output
In the first line of the output print the number of the solutions †N‡. In the next †N‡ lines print the solutions, formatted as "†XY‡", sorted in ascending order of †X‡, one solution per line.
