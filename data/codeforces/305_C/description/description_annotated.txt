Ivan has got an array of †n‡ non-negative integers †a‡1, †a‡2, ..., †a‡†n‡. Ivan knows that the array is sorted in the non-decreasing order. 
Ivan wrote out integers 2^†a‡1, 2^†a‡2, ..., 2^†a‡†n‡ on a piece of paper. Now he wonders, what minimum number of integers of form 2^†b‡ (†b‡ ≥ 0) need to be added to the piece of paper so that the sum of all integers written on the paper equalled 2^†v‡ - 1 for some integer †v‡ (†v‡ ≥ 0). 
Help Ivan, find the required quantity of numbers.

Input
The first line contains integer †n‡ (1 ≤ †n‡ ≤ 10^5). The second input line contains †n‡ space-separated integers †a‡1, †a‡2, ..., †a‡†n‡ (0 ≤ †a‡†i‡ ≤ 2·10^9). It is guaranteed that †a‡1 ≤ †a‡2 ≤ ... ≤ †a‡†n‡.

Output
Print a single integer — the answer to the problem.

Examples

Input
1
3

Output
3


Note
In the first sample you do not need to add anything, the sum of numbers already equals 2^3 - 1 = 7.
In the second sample you need to add numbers 2^0, 2^1, 2^2.
