Ivan has got an array of n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an. Ivan knows that the array is sorted in the non-decreasing order. 
Ivan wrote out integers 2^a1, 2^a2, ..., 2^an on a piece of paper. Now he wonders, what minimum number of integers of form 2^b (b ≥ 0) need to be added to the piece of paper so that the sum of all integers written on the paper equalled 2^v - 1 for some integer v (v ≥ 0). 
Help Ivan, find the required quantity of numbers.

Input
The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). The second input line contains n space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 2·10^9). It is guaranteed that a1 ≤ a2 ≤ ... ≤ an.

Output
Print a single integer — the answer to the problem.

Examples
Input
4
0 1 1 1

Output
0

Input
1
3

Output
3


Note
In the first sample you do not need to add anything, the sum of numbers already equals 2^3 - 1 = 7.
In the second sample you need to add numbers 2^0, 2^1, 2^2.
