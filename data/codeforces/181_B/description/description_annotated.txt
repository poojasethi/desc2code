You are given †n‡ points on a plane. All points are different.
Find the number of different groups of three points (†A‡, †B‡, †C‡) such that point †B‡ is the middle of segment †AC‡. 
The groups of three points are considered unordered, that is, if point †B‡ is the middle of segment †AC‡, then groups (†A‡, †B‡, †C‡) and (†C‡, †B‡, †A‡) are considered the same.

Input
The first line contains a single integer †n‡ (3 ≤ †n‡ ≤ 3000) — the number of points. 
Next †n‡ lines contain the points. The †i‡-th line contains coordinates of the †i‡-th point: two space-separated integers †x‡†i‡, †y‡†i‡ ( - 1000 ≤ †x‡†i‡, †y‡†i‡ ≤ 1000).
It is guaranteed that all given points are different.

Output
Print the single number — the answer to the problem.
