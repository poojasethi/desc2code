Dima got into number sequences. Now he's got sequence †a‡1, †a‡2, ..., †a‡†n‡, consisting of †n‡ positive integers. Also, Dima has got a function †f‡(†x‡), which can be defined with the following recurrence:
  †f‡(0) = 0;  †f‡(2·†x‡) = †f‡(†x‡);  †f‡(2·†x‡ + 1) = †f‡(†x‡) + 1. Dima wonders, how many pairs of indexes (†i‡, †j‡) (1 ≤ †i‡ < †j‡ ≤ †n‡) are there, such that †f‡(†a‡†i‡) = †f‡(†a‡†j‡). Help him, count the number of such pairs. 

Input
The first line contains integer †n‡ (1 ≤ †n‡ ≤ 10^5). The second line contains †n‡ positive integers †a‡1, †a‡2, ..., †a‡†n‡ (1 ≤ †a‡†i‡ ≤ 10^9).
The numbers in the lines are separated by single spaces.

Output
In a single line print the answer to the problem.
Please, don't use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.

Examples
Input
3
1 2 4

Output
3

Input
3
5 3 1

Output
1


Note
In the first sample any pair (†i‡, †j‡) will do, so the answer is 3.
In the second sample only pair (1, 2) will do.
