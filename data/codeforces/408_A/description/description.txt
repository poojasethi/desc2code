Little Vasya went to the supermarket to get some groceries. He walked about the supermarket for a long time and got a basket full of products. Now he needs to choose the cashier to pay for the products.
There are n cashiers at the exit from the supermarket. At the moment the queue for the i-th cashier already has ki people. The j-th person standing in the queue to the i-th cashier has mi, j items in the basket. Vasya knows that:
  the cashier needs 5 seconds to scan one item;  after the cashier scans each item of some customer, he needs 15 seconds to take the customer's money and give him the change. Of course, Vasya wants to select a queue so that he can leave the supermarket as soon as possible. Help him write a program that displays the minimum number of seconds after which Vasya can get to one of the cashiers.

Input
The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of cashes in the shop. The second line contains n space-separated integers: k1, k2, ..., kn (1 ≤ ki ≤ 100), where ki is the number of people in the queue to the i-th cashier.
The i-th of the next n lines contains ki space-separated integers: mi, 1, mi, 2, ..., mi, ki (1 ≤ mi, j ≤ 100) — the number of products the j-th person in the queue for the i-th cash has.

Output
Print a single integer — the minimum number of seconds Vasya needs to get to the cashier.

Note
In the second test sample, if Vasya goes to the first queue, he gets to the cashier in 100·5 + 15 = 515 seconds. But if he chooses the second queue, he will need 1·5 + 2·5 + 2·5 + 3·5 + 4·15 = 100 seconds. He will need 1·5 + 9·5 + 1·5 + 3·15 = 100 seconds for the third one and 7·5 + 8·5 + 2·15 = 105 seconds for the fourth one. Thus, Vasya gets to the cashier quicker if he chooses the second or the third queue.
