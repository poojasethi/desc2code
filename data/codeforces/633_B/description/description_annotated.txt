Mr. Santa asks all the great programmers of the world to solve a trivial problem. He gives them an integer †m‡ and asks for the number of positive integers †n‡, such that the factorial of †n‡ ends with exactly †m‡ zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?

Input
The only line of input contains an integer †m‡ (1 ≤ †m‡ ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.

Output
First print †k‡ — the number of values of †n‡ such that the factorial of †n‡ ends with †m‡ zeroes. Then print these †k‡ integers in increasing order.

Examples
Input
1

Output
5
5 6 7 8 9 
Input
5

Output
0


Note
The factorial of †n‡ is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to †n‡ inclusive, that is †n‡! = 1·2·3·...·†n‡.
In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.
