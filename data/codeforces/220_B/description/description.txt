The Little Elephant loves playing with arrays. He has array a, consisting of n positive integers, indexed from 1 to n. Let's denote the number with index i as ai. 
Additionally the Little Elephant has m queries to the array, each query is characterised by a pair of integers lj and rj (1 ≤ lj ≤ rj ≤ n). For each query lj, rj the Little Elephant has to count, how many numbers x exist, such that number x occurs exactly x times among numbers alj, alj + 1, ..., arj.
Help the Little Elephant to count the answers to all queries.

Input
The first line contains two space-separated integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5) — the size of array a and the number of queries to it. The next line contains n space-separated positive integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9). Next m lines contain descriptions of queries, one per line. The j-th of these lines contains the description of the j-th query as two space-separated integers lj and rj (1 ≤ lj ≤ rj ≤ n).

Output
In m lines print m integers — the answers to the queries. The j-th line should contain the answer to the j-th query.
