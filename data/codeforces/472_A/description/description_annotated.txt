One way to create a task is to learn from math. You can generate some random math statement or modify some theorems to get something new and build a new task from that.
For example, there is a statement called the "Goldbach's conjecture". It says: "each even number no less than four can be expressed as the sum of two primes". Let's modify it. How about a statement like that: "each integer no less than 12 can be expressed as the sum of two composite numbers." Not like the Goldbach's conjecture, I can prove this theorem.
You are given an integer †n‡ no less than 12, express it as a sum of two composite numbers.

Input
The only line contains an integer †n‡ (12 ≤ †n‡ ≤ 10^6).

Output
Output two composite integers †x‡ and †y‡ (1 < †x‡, †y‡ < †n‡) such that †x‡ + †y‡ = †n‡. If there are multiple solutions, you can output any of them.

Examples
Input
12

Output
4 8

Input
15

Output
6 9

Input
23

Output
8 15

Input
1000000

Output
500000 500000


Note
In the first example, 12 = 4 + 8 and both 4, 8 are composite numbers. You can output "6 6" or "8 4" as well.
In the second example, 15 = 6 + 9. Note that you can't output "1 14" because 1 is not a composite number.
