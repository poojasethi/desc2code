Ehsan loves geometry! Especially he likes to rotate points!
Given a point in the plane, Ehsan likes to rotate it by †k‡ degrees (counter-clockwise), around the origin. What is the result of this rotation?

Input
A single integer †k‡ (0 ≤ †k‡ < 360) is given in the first line. Two integer numbers †x‡ and †y‡ are given in the second line ( - 1390 ≤ †x‡, †y‡ ≤ 1390).

Output
Write two numbers. The result of the rotation. Your answer must have a relative error less than 10^-1.

Examples
