Marina loves strings of the same length and Vasya loves when there is a third string, different from them in exactly †t‡ characters. Help Vasya find at least one such string.
More formally, you are given two strings †s‡1, †s‡2 of length †n‡ and number †t‡. Let's denote as †f‡(†a‡, †b‡) the number of characters in which strings †a‡ and †b‡ are different. Then your task will be to find any string †s‡3 of length †n‡, such that †f‡(†s‡1, †s‡3) = †f‡(†s‡2, †s‡3) = †t‡. If there is no such string, print  - 1.

Input
The first line contains two integers †n‡ and †t‡ (1 ≤ †n‡ ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ †t‡ ≤ †n‡).
The second line contains string †s‡1 of length †n‡, consisting of lowercase English letters.
The third line contain string †s‡2 of length †n‡, consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output
Print a string of length †n‡, differing from string †s‡1 and from †s‡2 in exactly †t‡ characters. Your string should consist only from lowercase English letters. If such string doesn't exist, print -1.
