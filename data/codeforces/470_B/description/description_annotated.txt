This (unpronounceable) word means simply fear of number 666. 
You are given a string of digits. Check whether it is scary for a person suffering from this phobia, i.e., whether it contains number 666 as a substring.

Input
The input will consist of a single string †p‡. The string contains between 1 and 100 digits ('0'-'9'), inclusive. The string doesn't contain any other characters except digits.

Output
Output "YES" if given string contains number 666, and "NO" otherwise (quotes for clarity only).

Examples
Input
123098

Output
NO

Input
16660

Output
YES

Input
1606061

Note
Note that 666 must be a contiguous substring of †p‡, not a subsequence (see sample 3).
