Little Artem is given a graph, constructed as follows: start with some †k‡-clique, then add new vertices one by one, connecting them to †k‡ already existing vertices that form a †k‡-clique.
Artem wants to count the number of spanning trees in this graph modulo 10^9 + 7.

Input
First line of the input contains two integers †n‡ and †k‡ (1 ≤ †n‡ ≤ 10 000, 1 ≤ †k‡ ≤ †min‡(†n‡, 5)) — the total size of the graph and the size of the initial clique, respectively.
Next †n‡ - †k‡ lines describe †k‡ + 1-th, †k‡ + 2-th, ..., †i‡-th, ..., †n‡-th vertices by listing †k‡ distinct vertex indices 1 ≤ †a‡†ij‡ < †i‡ it is connected to. It is guaranteed that those vertices form a k-clique.

Output
Output a single integer — the number of spanning trees in the given graph modulo 10^9 + 7.
