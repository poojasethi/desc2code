Everything is great about Ilya's city, except the roads. The thing is, the only ZooVille road is represented as n holes in a row. We will consider the holes numbered from 1 to n, from left to right.
Ilya is really keep on helping his city. So, he wants to fix at least k holes (perharps he can fix more) on a single ZooVille road. 
The city has m building companies, the i-th company needs ci money units to fix a road segment containing holes with numbers of at least li and at most ri. The companies in ZooVille are very greedy, so, if they fix a segment containing some already fixed holes, they do not decrease the price for fixing the segment. 
Determine the minimum money Ilya will need to fix at least k holes.

Input
The first line contains three integers n, m, k (1 ≤ n ≤ 300, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n). The next m lines contain the companies' description. The i-th line contains three integers li, ri, ci (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ n, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 10^9).

Output
Print a single integer — the minimum money Ilya needs to fix at least k holes. 
If it is impossible to fix at least k holes, print -1.
Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.
