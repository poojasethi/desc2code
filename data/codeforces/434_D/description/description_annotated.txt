Nanami likes playing games, and is also really good at it. This day she was playing a new game which involved operating a power plant. Nanami's job is to control the generators in the plant and produce maximum output.
There are †n‡ generators in the plant. Each generator should be set to a generating level. Generating level is an integer (possibly zero or negative), the generating level of the †i‡-th generator should be between †l‡†i‡ and †r‡†i‡ (both inclusive). The output of a generator can be calculated using a certain quadratic function †f‡(†x‡), where †x‡ is the generating level of the generator. Each generator has its own function, the function of the †i‡-th generator is denoted as †f‡†i‡(†x‡).
However, there are †m‡ further restrictions to the generators. Let the generating level of the †i‡-th generator be †x‡†i‡. Each restriction is of the form †x‡†u‡ ≤ †x‡†v‡ + †d‡, where †u‡ and †v‡ are IDs of two different generators and †d‡ is an integer.
Nanami found the game tedious but giving up is against her creed. So she decided to have a program written to calculate the answer for her (the maximum total output of generators). Somehow, this became your job.

Input
The first line contains two integers †n‡ and †m‡ (1 ≤ †n‡ ≤ 50; 0 ≤ †m‡ ≤ 100) — the number of generators and the number of restrictions.
Then follow †n‡ lines, each line contains three integers †a‡†i‡, †b‡†i‡, and †c‡†i‡ (|†a‡†i‡| ≤ 10; |†b‡†i‡|, |†c‡†i‡| ≤ 1000) — the coefficients of the function †f‡†i‡(†x‡). That is, †f‡†i‡(†x‡) = †a‡†i‡†x‡^2 + †b‡†i‡†x‡ + †c‡†i‡.
Then follow another †n‡ lines, each line contains two integers †l‡†i‡ and †r‡†i‡ ( - 100 ≤ †l‡†i‡ ≤ †r‡†i‡ ≤ 100).
Then follow †m‡ lines, each line contains three integers †u‡†i‡, †v‡†i‡, and †d‡†i‡ (1 ≤ †u‡†i‡, †v‡†i‡ ≤ †n‡; †u‡†i‡ ≠ †v‡†i‡; |†d‡†i‡| ≤ 200), describing a restriction. The †i‡-th restriction is †x‡†u‡†i‡ ≤ †x‡†v‡†i‡ + †d‡†i‡.

Output
Print a single line containing a single integer — the maximum output of all the generators. It is guaranteed that there exists at least one valid configuration.

Note
In the first sample, †f‡1(†x‡) = †x‡, †f‡2(†x‡) = †x‡ + 1, and †f‡3(†x‡) = †x‡ + 2, so we are to maximize the sum of the generating levels. The restrictions are †x‡1 ≤ †x‡2, †x‡2 ≤ †x‡3, and †x‡3 ≤ †x‡1, which gives us †x‡1 = †x‡2 = †x‡3. The optimal configuration is †x‡1 = †x‡2 = †x‡3 = 2, which produces an output of 9.
In the second sample, restrictions are equal to |†x‡†i‡ - †x‡†i‡ + 1| ≤ 3 for 1 ≤ †i‡ < †n‡. One of the optimal configurations is †x‡1 = 1, †x‡2 = 4, †x‡3 = 5, †x‡4 = 8 and †x‡5 = 7.
