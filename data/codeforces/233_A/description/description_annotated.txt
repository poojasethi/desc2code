A permutation is a sequence of integers †p‡1, †p‡2, ..., †p‡†n‡, consisting of †n‡ distinct positive integers, each of them doesn't exceed †n‡. Let's denote the †i‡-th element of permutation †p‡ as †p‡†i‡. We'll call number †n‡ the size of permutation †p‡1, †p‡2, ..., †p‡†n‡.
Nickolas adores permutations. He likes some permutations more than the others. He calls such permutations perfect. A perfect permutation is such permutation †p‡ that for any †i‡ (1 ≤ †i‡ ≤ †n‡) (†n‡ is the permutation size) the following equations hold †p‡†p‡†i‡ = †i‡ and †p‡†i‡ ≠ †i‡. Nickolas asks you to print any perfect permutation of size †n‡ for the given †n‡.

Input
A single line contains a single integer †n‡ (1 ≤ †n‡ ≤ 100) — the permutation size.

Output
If a perfect permutation of size †n‡ doesn't exist, print a single integer -1. Otherwise print †n‡ distinct integers from 1 to †n‡, †p‡1, †p‡2, ..., †p‡†n‡ — permutation †p‡, that is perfect. Separate printed numbers by whitespaces.
