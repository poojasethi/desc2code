You are given a set of points on a plane with positive integer coordinates. Find a triangle of minimum area with vertices in points (0, 0), (†A‡, 0) and (0, †B‡) (†A‡ and †B‡ are unknown positive integers) that contains all the given points inside it (points on the edges count towards being inside).

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer †N‡ (1 ≤ †N‡ ≤ 100) — the number of points. The following †N‡ lines contain pairs of numbers †X‡ and †Y‡ (1 ≤ †X‡, †Y‡ ≤ 100) - the coordinates of the points. All points are distinct.

Output
Output one floating-point number — the minimal area of the triangle. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^-4.
