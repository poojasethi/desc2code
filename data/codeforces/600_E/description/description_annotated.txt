You are given a rooted tree with root in vertex 1. Each vertex is coloured in some colour.
Let's call colour †c‡ dominating in the subtree of vertex †v‡ if there are no other colours that appear in the subtree of vertex †v‡ more times than colour †c‡. So it's possible that two or more colours will be dominating in the subtree of some vertex.
The subtree of vertex †v‡ is the vertex †v‡ and all other vertices that contains vertex †v‡ in each path to the root.
For each vertex †v‡ find the sum of all dominating colours in the subtree of vertex †v‡.

Input
The first line contains integer †n‡ (1 ≤ †n‡ ≤ 10^5) — the number of vertices in the tree.
The second line contains †n‡ integers †c‡†i‡ (1 ≤ †c‡†i‡ ≤ †n‡), †c‡†i‡ — the colour of the †i‡-th vertex.
Each of the next †n‡ - 1 lines contains two integers †x‡†j‡, †y‡†j‡ (1 ≤ †x‡†j‡, †y‡†j‡ ≤ †n‡) — the edge of the tree. The first vertex is the root of the tree.

Output
Print †n‡ integers — the sums of dominating colours for each vertex.
