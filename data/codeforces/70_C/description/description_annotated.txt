In Walrusland public transport tickets are characterized by two integers: by the number of the series and by the number of the ticket in the series. Let the series number be represented by †a‡ and the ticket number — by †b‡, then a ticket is described by the ordered pair of numbers (†a‡, †b‡). 
The walruses believe that a ticket is lucky if †a‡ * †b‡ = †rev‡(†a‡) * †rev‡(†b‡). The function †rev‡(†x‡) reverses a number written in the decimal system, at that the leading zeroes disappear. For example, †rev‡(12343) = 34321, †rev‡(1200) = 21.
The Public Transport Management Committee wants to release †x‡ series, each containing †y‡ tickets, so that at least †w‡ lucky tickets were released and the total number of released tickets (†x‡ * †y‡) were minimum. The series are numbered from 1 to †x‡ inclusive. The tickets in each series are numbered from 1 to †y‡ inclusive. The Transport Committee cannot release more than †max‡†x‡ series and more than †max‡†y‡ tickets in one series.

Input
The first line contains three integers †max‡†x‡, †max‡†y‡, †w‡ (1 ≤ †max‡†x‡, †max‡†y‡ ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ †w‡ ≤ 10^7).

Output
Print on a single line two space-separated numbers, the †x‡ and the †y‡. If there are several possible variants, print any of them. If such †x‡ and †y‡ do not exist, print a single number  - 1.
