We'll call a sequence of integers a good k-d sequence if we can add to it at most k numbers in such a way that after the sorting the sequence will be an arithmetic progression with difference d.
You got hold of some sequence a, consisting of n integers. Your task is to find its longest contiguous subsegment, such that it is a good k-d sequence.

Input
The first line contains three space-separated integers n, k, d (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5; 0 ≤ k ≤ 2·10^5; 0 ≤ d ≤ 10^9). The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an ( - 10^9 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9) — the actual sequence.

Output
Print two space-separated integers l, r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) show that sequence al, al + 1, ..., ar is the longest subsegment that is a good k-d sequence.
If there are multiple optimal answers, print the one with the minimum value of l.

Examples
Input
6 1 2
4 3 2 8 6 2

Output
3 5


Note
In the first test sample the answer is the subsegment consisting of numbers 2, 8, 6 — after adding number 4 and sorting it becomes sequence 2, 4, 6, 8 — the arithmetic progression with difference 2.
