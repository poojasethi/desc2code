There is a game called "I Wanna Be the Guy", consisting of n levels. Little X and his friend Little Y are addicted to the game. Each of them wants to pass the whole game.
Little X can pass only p levels of the game. And Little Y can pass only q levels of the game. You are given the indices of levels Little X can pass and the indices of levels Little Y can pass. Will Little X and Little Y pass the whole game, if they cooperate each other?

Input
The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤  n ≤ 100). 
The next line contains an integer p (0 ≤ p ≤ n) at first, then follows p distinct integers a1, a2, ..., ap (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). These integers denote the indices of levels Little X can pass. The next line contains the levels Little Y can pass in the same format. It's assumed that levels are numbered from 1 to n.

Output
If they can pass all the levels, print "I become the guy.". If it's impossible, print "Oh, my keyboard!" (without the quotes).

Examples
Input
4
3 1 2 3
2 2 4

Output
I become the guy.

Input
4
3 1 2 3
2 2 3

Output
Oh, my keyboard!


Note
In the first sample, Little X can pass levels [1 2 3], and Little Y can pass level [2 4], so they can pass all the levels both.
In the second sample, no one can pass level 4.
