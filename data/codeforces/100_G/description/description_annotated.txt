The famous singer, Aryo, is going to publish a new album of his great work!
Unfortunately these days, there are many albums, Aryo wants to choose a new name for his album, a name that has not been used or at least has not been used recently.
He has a list of all used album names together with the year the albums were published. He also has a list of suitable names for his album.
If he finds a suitable name which has not been used before, he'll use it. Otherwise he will use the name which was used as long ago as possible. If two such names are found (that haven't been used or were used at the same year), he uses the name that is alphabetically latest.
