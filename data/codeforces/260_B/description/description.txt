A recently found Ancient Prophesy is believed to contain the exact Apocalypse date. The prophesy is a string that only consists of digits and characters "-".
We'll say that some date is mentioned in the Prophesy if there is a substring in the Prophesy that is the date's record in the format "dd-mm-yyyy". We'll say that the number of the date's occurrences is the number of such substrings in the Prophesy. For example, the Prophesy "0012-10-2012-10-2012" mentions date 12-10-2012 twice (first time as "0012-10-2012-10-2012", second time as "0012-10-2012-10-2012").
The date of the Apocalypse is such correct date that the number of times it is mentioned in the Prophesy is strictly larger than that of any other correct date.
A date is correct if the year lies in the range from 2013 to 2015, the month is from 1 to 12, and the number of the day is strictly more than a zero and doesn't exceed the number of days in the current month. Note that a date is written in the format "dd-mm-yyyy", that means that leading zeroes may be added to the numbers of the months or days if needed. In other words, date "1-1-2013" isn't recorded in the format "dd-mm-yyyy", and date "01-01-2013" is recorded in it.
Notice, that any year between 2013 and 2015 is not a leap year.
