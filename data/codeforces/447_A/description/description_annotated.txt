DZY has a hash table with †p‡ buckets, numbered from 0 to †p‡ - 1. He wants to insert †n‡ numbers, in the order they are given, into the hash table. For the †i‡-th number †x‡†i‡, DZY will put it into the bucket numbered †h‡(†x‡†i‡), where †h‡(†x‡) is the hash function. In this problem we will assume, that †h‡(†x‡) = †x‡ †mod‡ †p‡. Operation †a‡ †mod‡ †b‡ denotes taking a remainder after division †a‡ by †b‡.
However, each bucket can contain no more than one element. If DZY wants to insert an number into a bucket which is already filled, we say a "conflict" happens. Suppose the first conflict happens right after the †i‡-th insertion, you should output †i‡. If no conflict happens, just output -1.

Input
The first line contains two integers, †p‡ and †n‡ (2 ≤ †p‡, †n‡ ≤ 300). Then †n‡ lines follow. The †i‡-th of them contains an integer †x‡†i‡ (0 ≤ †x‡†i‡ ≤ 10^9).

Output
Output a single integer — the answer to the problem.
