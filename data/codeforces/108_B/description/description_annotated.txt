Tattah's youngest brother, Tuftuf, is new to programming.
Since his older brother is such a good programmer, his biggest dream is to outshine him. Tuftuf is a student at the German University in Cairo (GUC) where he learns to write programs in Gava.
Today, Tuftuf was introduced to Gava's unsigned integer datatypes. Gava has †n‡ unsigned integer datatypes of sizes (in bits) †a‡1, †a‡2, ... †a‡†n‡. The †i‡-th datatype have size †a‡†i‡ bits, so it can represent every integer between 0 and 2^†a‡†i‡ - 1 inclusive. 
Tuftuf is thinking of learning a better programming language. If there exists an integer †x‡, such that †x‡ fits in some type †i‡ (in †a‡†i‡ bits) and †x‡·†x‡ does not fit in some other type †j‡ (in †a‡†j‡ bits) where †a‡†i‡ < †a‡†j‡, then Tuftuf will stop using Gava.
Your task is to determine Tuftuf's destiny.

Input
The first line contains integer †n‡ (2 ≤ †n‡ ≤ 10^5) — the number of Gava's unsigned integer datatypes' sizes. The second line contains a single-space-separated list of †n‡ integers (1 ≤ †a‡†i‡ ≤ 10^9) — sizes of datatypes in bits. Some datatypes may have equal sizes.

Output
Print "YES" if Tuftuf will stop using Gava, and "NO" otherwise.

Examples
Input
3
64 16 32

Output
NO

Input
4
4 2 1 3

Output
YES


Note
In the second example, †x‡ = 7 (1112) fits in 3 bits, but †x‡^2 = 49 (1100012) does not fit in 4 bits.
