We'll define S(n) for positive integer n as follows: the number of the n's digits in the decimal base. For example, S(893) = 3, S(114514) = 6.
You want to make a consecutive integer sequence starting from number m (m, m + 1, ...). But you need to pay S(n)·k to add the number n to the sequence.
You can spend a cost up to w, and you want to make the sequence as long as possible. Write a program that tells sequence's maximum length.

Input
The first line contains three integers w (1 ≤ w ≤ 10^16), m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^16), k (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9).
Please, do not write the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.

Output
The first line should contain a single integer — the answer to the problem.
