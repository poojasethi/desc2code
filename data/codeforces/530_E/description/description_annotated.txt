You are given integers †N‡ and †D‡. Find †N‡ positive integers †x‡1...†x‡†N‡ such that the difference of their product and their sum equals †D‡.

Input
The only line of input contains integers †N‡ (2 ≤ †N‡ ≤ 1000) and †D‡ (0 ≤ †D‡ ≤ 1000).

Output
Output †N‡ integers that satisfy the given condition in non-decreasing order (in a single line, separated with spaces). Note that some numbers can be equal. Numbers printed by you must not exceed 10^6.
