The integer numbers from 1 to †nm‡ was put into rectangular table having †n‡ rows and †m‡ columns. The numbers was put from left to right, from top to bottom, i.e. the first row contains integers 1, 2, ..., †m‡, the second — †m‡ + 1, †m‡ + 2, ..., 2 * †m‡ and so on.
After it these numbers was written on the paper in another order: from top to bottom, from left to right. First, the numbers in the first column was written (from top to bottom) and so on.
Print the †k‡-th number on the paper.

Input
The only line in the input contains three integer numbers †n‡, †m‡ and †k‡ (1 ≤ †n‡, †m‡ ≤ 20000, 1 ≤ †k‡ ≤ †nm‡).

Output
Print the required number.
