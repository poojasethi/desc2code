You are given a quadratic equation with integer coefficients †A‡ * †X‡^2 + †B‡ * †X‡ + †C‡ = 0. It is guaranteed that †A‡ ≠ 0 and that the equation has at least one real root. Output the roots of the equation.

Input
The only line of input contains integers †A‡, †B‡ and †C‡ ( - 1000 ≤ †A‡, †B‡, †C‡ ≤ 1000, †A‡ ≠ 0), separated by spaces.

Output
Output the roots of the equation in increasing order. If the equation has a single root of multiplicity 2, output it once. The root is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^-4.
