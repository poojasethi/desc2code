You have †r‡ red, †g‡ green and †b‡ blue balloons. To decorate a single table for the banquet you need exactly three balloons. Three balloons attached to some table shouldn't have the same color. What maximum number †t‡ of tables can be decorated if we know number of balloons of each color?
Your task is to write a program that for given values †r‡, †g‡ and †b‡ will find the maximum number †t‡ of tables, that can be decorated in the required manner.

Input
The single line contains three integers †r‡, †g‡ and †b‡ (0 ≤ †r‡, †g‡, †b‡ ≤ 2·10^9) — the number of red, green and blue baloons respectively. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.

Output
Print a single integer †t‡ — the maximum number of tables that can be decorated in the required manner.

Examples
Input
5 4 3

Output
4

Input
1 1 1

Output
1

Input
2 3 3

Output
2


Note
In the first sample you can decorate the tables with the following balloon sets: "rgg", "gbb", "brr", "rrg", where "r", "g" and "b" represent the red, green and blue balls, respectively.
