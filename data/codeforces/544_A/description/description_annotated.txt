You are given a string †q‡. A sequence of †k‡ strings †s‡1, †s‡2, ..., †s‡†k‡ is called beautiful, if the concatenation of these strings is string †q‡ (formally, †s‡1 + †s‡2 + ... + †s‡†k‡ = †q‡) and the first characters of these strings are distinct.
Find any beautiful sequence of strings or determine that the beautiful sequence doesn't exist.

Input
The first line contains a positive integer †k‡ (1 ≤ †k‡ ≤ 26) — the number of strings that should be in a beautiful sequence. 
The second line contains string †q‡, consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The length of the string is within range from 1 to 100, inclusive.

Output
If such sequence doesn't exist, then print in a single line "NO" (without the quotes). Otherwise, print in the first line "YES" (without the quotes) and in the next †k‡ lines print the beautiful sequence of strings †s‡1, †s‡2, ..., †s‡†k‡.
If there are multiple possible answers, print any of them.

Examples
Input
1
abca

Output
YES
abca

Input
2
aaacas

Output
YES
aaa
cas

Input
4
abc

Output
NO


Note
In the second sample there are two possible answers: {"†aaaca‡", "†s‡"} and {"†aaa‡", "†cas‡"}.
