The sequence of integer pairs (a1, b1), (a2, b2), ..., (ak, bk) is beautiful, if the following statements are fulfilled: 
  1 ≤ a1 ≤ b1 < a2 ≤ b2 < ... < ak ≤ bk ≤ n, where n is a given positive integer;  all numbers b1 - a1, b2 - a2, ..., bk - ak are distinct. For the given number n find the number of beautiful sequences of length k. As the answer can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing it by 1000000007 (10^9 + 7).

Input
The first line contains integer t (1 ≤ t ≤  2·10^5) — the number of the test data.
Each of the next t lines contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 1000).

Output
For each test from the input print the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7). Print the answers to the tests in the order in which the tests are given in the input.

Note
In the first test sample there is exactly one beautiful sequence: (1, 1).
In the second test sample, the following sequences are beautiful: 
  (1, 1);  (1, 2);  (2, 2). In the fourth test sample, the following sequences are beautiful: 
  (1, 1);  (1, 2);  (1, 3);  (2, 2);  (2, 3);  (3, 3). In the fifth test sample, the following sequences are beautiful: 
  (1, 1), (2, 3);  (1, 2), (3, 3). In the third and sixth samples, there are no beautiful sequences.
