The Little Elephant has two permutations †a‡ and †b‡ of length †n‡, consisting of numbers from 1 to †n‡, inclusive. Let's denote the †i‡-th (1 ≤ †i‡ ≤ †n‡) element of the permutation †a‡ as †a‡†i‡, the †j‡-th (1 ≤ †j‡ ≤ †n‡) element of the permutation †b‡ — as †b‡†j‡.
The distance between permutations †a‡ and †b‡ is the minimum absolute value of the difference between the positions of the occurrences of some number in †a‡ and in †b‡. More formally, it's such minimum |†i‡ - †j‡|, that †a‡†i‡ = †b‡†j‡.
A cyclic shift number †i‡ (1 ≤ †i‡ ≤ †n‡) of permutation †b‡ consisting from †n‡ elements is a permutation †b‡†i‡†b‡†i‡ + 1... †b‡†n‡†b‡1†b‡2... †b‡†i‡ - 1. Overall a permutation has †n‡ cyclic shifts.
The Little Elephant wonders, for all cyclic shifts of permutation †b‡, what is the distance between the cyclic shift and permutation †a‡?

Input
The first line contains a single integer †n‡ (1 ≤ †n‡ ≤ 10^5) — the size of the permutations. The second line contains permutation †a‡ as †n‡ distinct numbers from 1 to †n‡, inclusive. The numbers are separated with single spaces. The third line contains permutation †b‡ in the same format.

Output
In †n‡ lines print †n‡ integers — the answers for cyclic shifts. Print the answers to the shifts in the order of the shifts' numeration in permutation †b‡, that is, first for the 1-st cyclic shift, then for the 2-nd, and so on.
