The Little Elephant has two permutations a and b of length n, consisting of numbers from 1 to n, inclusive. Let's denote the i-th (1 ≤ i ≤ n) element of the permutation a as ai, the j-th (1 ≤ j ≤ n) element of the permutation b — as bj.
The distance between permutations a and b is the minimum absolute value of the difference between the positions of the occurrences of some number in a and in b. More formally, it's such minimum |i - j|, that ai = bj.
A cyclic shift number i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) of permutation b consisting from n elements is a permutation bibi + 1... bnb1b2... bi - 1. Overall a permutation has n cyclic shifts.
The Little Elephant wonders, for all cyclic shifts of permutation b, what is the distance between the cyclic shift and permutation a?

Input
The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the size of the permutations. The second line contains permutation a as n distinct numbers from 1 to n, inclusive. The numbers are separated with single spaces. The third line contains permutation b in the same format.

Output
In n lines print n integers — the answers for cyclic shifts. Print the answers to the shifts in the order of the shifts' numeration in permutation b, that is, first for the 1-st cyclic shift, then for the 2-nd, and so on.
