Asterix, Obelix and their temporary buddies Suffix and Prefix has finally found the Harmony temple. However, its doors were firmly locked and even Obelix had no luck opening them.
A little later they found a string s, carved on a rock below the temple's gates. Asterix supposed that that's the password that opens the temple and read the string aloud. However, nothing happened. Then Asterix supposed that a password is some substring t of the string s.
Prefix supposed that the substring t is the beginning of the string s; Suffix supposed that the substring t should be the end of the string s; and Obelix supposed that t should be located somewhere inside the string s, that is, t is neither its beginning, nor its end.
Asterix chose the substring t so as to please all his companions. Besides, from all acceptable variants Asterix chose the longest one (as Asterix loves long strings). When Asterix read the substring t aloud, the temple doors opened. 
You know the string s. Find the substring t or determine that such substring does not exist and all that's been written above is just a nice legend.

Input
You are given the string s whose length can vary from 1 to 10^6 (inclusive), consisting of small Latin letters.

Output
Print the string t. If a suitable t string does not exist, then print "Just a legend" without the quotes.
