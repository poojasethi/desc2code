Appleman has a tree with †n‡ vertices. Some of the vertices (at least one) are colored black and other vertices are colored white.
Consider a set consisting of †k‡ (0 ≤ †k‡ < †n‡) edges of Appleman's tree. If Appleman deletes these edges from the tree, then it will split into (†k‡ + 1) parts. Note, that each part will be a tree with colored vertices.
Now Appleman wonders, what is the number of sets splitting the tree in such a way that each resulting part will have exactly one black vertex? Find this number modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7).

Input
The first line contains an integer †n‡ (2  ≤ †n‡ ≤ 10^5) — the number of tree vertices. 
The second line contains the description of the tree: †n‡ - 1 integers †p‡0, †p‡1, ..., †p‡†n‡ - 2 (0 ≤ †p‡†i‡ ≤ †i‡). Where †p‡†i‡ means that there is an edge connecting vertex (†i‡ + 1) of the tree and vertex †p‡†i‡. Consider tree vertices are numbered from 0 to †n‡ - 1.
The third line contains the description of the colors of the vertices: †n‡ integers †x‡0, †x‡1, ..., †x‡†n‡ - 1 (†x‡†i‡ is either 0 or 1). If †x‡†i‡ is equal to 1, vertex †i‡ is colored black. Otherwise, vertex †i‡ is colored white.

Output
Output a single integer — the number of ways to split the tree modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7).
