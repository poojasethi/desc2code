While resting on the ship after the "Russian Code Cup" a boy named Misha invented an interesting game. He promised to give his quadrocopter to whoever will be the first one to make a rectangular table of size †n‡ × †m‡, consisting of positive integers such that the sum of the squares of numbers for each row and each column was also a square.
Since checking the correctness of the table manually is difficult, Misha asks you to make each number in the table to not exceed 10^8.

Input
The first line contains two integers †n‡ and †m‡ (1 ≤ †n‡, †m‡ ≤ 100)  — the size of the table. 

Output
Print the table that meets the condition: †n‡ lines containing †m‡ integers, separated by spaces. If there are multiple possible answers, you are allowed to print anyone. It is guaranteed that there exists at least one correct answer.
