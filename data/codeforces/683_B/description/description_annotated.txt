In the †i‡-th line there is pupil's name †name‡†i‡ (a non-empty string which consists of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters, the length does not exceed five) and pupil's height †x‡†i‡ (130 ≤ †x‡†i‡ ≤ 215). Some pupils can have the same name. Uppercase and lowercase letters of the alphabet should be considered different.
