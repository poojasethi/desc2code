DZY loves colors, and he enjoys painting.
On a colorful day, DZY gets a colorful ribbon, which consists of n units (they are numbered from 1 to n from left to right). The color of the i-th unit of the ribbon is i at first. It is colorful enough, but we still consider that the colorfulness of each unit is 0 at first.
DZY loves painting, we know. He takes up a paintbrush with color x and uses it to draw a line on the ribbon. In such a case some contiguous units are painted. Imagine that the color of unit i currently is y. When it is painted by this paintbrush, the color of the unit becomes x, and the colorfulness of the unit increases by |x - y|.
DZY wants to perform m operations, each operation can be one of the following:
  Paint all the units with numbers between l and r (both inclusive) with color x.  Ask the sum of colorfulness of the units between l and r (both inclusive). Can you help DZY?

Input
The first line contains two space-separated integers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5).
Each of the next m lines begins with a integer type (1 ≤ type ≤ 2), which represents the type of this operation.
If type = 1, there will be 3 more integers l, r, x (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n; 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8) in this line, describing an operation 1.
If type = 2, there will be 2 more integers l, r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) in this line, describing an operation 2.

Output
For each operation 2, print a line containing the answer — sum of colorfulness.

2 1 10

Output
129


Note
In the first sample, the color of each unit is initially [1, 2, 3], and the colorfulness is [0, 0, 0].
After the first operation, colors become [4, 4, 3], colorfulness become [3, 2, 0].
After the second operation, colors become [4, 5, 5], colorfulness become [3, 3, 2].
So the answer to the only operation of type 2 is 8.
