Permutation †p‡ is an ordered set of integers †p‡1,   †p‡2,   ...,   †p‡†n‡, consisting of †n‡ distinct positive integers not larger than †n‡. We'll denote as †n‡ the length of permutation †p‡1,   †p‡2,   ...,   †p‡†n‡.
Your task is to find such permutation †p‡ of length †n‡, that the group of numbers |†p‡1 - †p‡2|, |†p‡2 - †p‡3|, ..., |†p‡†n‡ - 1 - †p‡†n‡| has exactly †k‡ distinct elements.

Input
The single line of the input contains two space-separated positive integers †n‡, †k‡ (1 ≤ †k‡ < †n‡ ≤ 10^5).

Output
Print †n‡ integers forming the permutation. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Examples
Input
3 2

Note
By |†x‡| we denote the absolute value of number †x‡.
