Permutation p is an ordered set of integers p1,   p2,   ...,   pn, consisting of n distinct positive integers not larger than n. We'll denote as n the length of permutation p1,   p2,   ...,   pn.
Your task is to find such permutation p of length n, that the group of numbers |p1 - p2|, |p2 - p3|, ..., |pn - 1 - pn| has exactly k distinct elements.

Input
The single line of the input contains two space-separated positive integers n, k (1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5).

Output
Print n integers forming the permutation. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Examples
