You are given a permutation of the numbers 1, 2, ..., n and m pairs of positions (aj, bj).
At each step you can choose a pair from the given positions and swap the numbers in that positions. What is the lexicographically maximal permutation one can get?
Let p and q be two permutations of the numbers 1, 2, ..., n. p is lexicographically smaller than the q if a number 1 ≤ i ≤ n exists, so pk = qk for 1 ≤ k < i and pi < qi.

Input
The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^6) — the length of the permutation p and the number of pairs of positions.
The second line contains n distinct integers pi (1 ≤ pi ≤ n) — the elements of the permutation p.
Each of the last m lines contains two integers (aj, bj) (1 ≤ aj, bj ≤ n) — the pairs of positions to swap. Note that you are given a positions, not the values to swap.

Output
Print the only line with n distinct integers p'i (1 ≤ p'i ≤ n) — the lexicographically maximal permutation one can get.
