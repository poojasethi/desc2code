Periodic decimal fraction is usually written as: [entire_part.non-periodic_part (period)]. Any simple fraction can be represented as a periodic decimal fraction and vice versa. For example, the decimal fraction 0.2(45) corresponds to a fraction 27 / 110. Your task is to convert the periodic fraction to a simple periodic fraction.

Input
The first line contains the periodic decimal fraction †x‡ (0 < †x‡ < 1) in the format described in the statement. The total number of digits in the period and non-periodic part of the fraction does not exceed 8. Non-periodic part may be absent, the periodic part can't be absent (but it can be equal to any non-negative number).

Output
Print the representation of the fraction †x‡ as a simple fraction †p‡ / †q‡, where †p‡ and †q‡ are mutually prime integers.

Examples
Input
0.2(45)

Output
27/110

Input
0.75(0)

Output
3/4
