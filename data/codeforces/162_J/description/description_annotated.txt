A sequence of brackets is called balanced if one can turn it into a valid math expression by adding characters "+" and "1". For example, sequences "(())()", "()" and "(()(()))" are balanced, while ")(", "(()" and "(()))(" are not.
You are given a string which consists of opening and closing round brackets. Check whether it is a balanced bracket sequence.

Input
