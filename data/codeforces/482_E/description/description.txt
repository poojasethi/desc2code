You have a root tree containing n vertexes. Let's number the tree vertexes with integers from 1 to n. The tree root is in the vertex 1.
Each vertex (except fot the tree root) v has a direct ancestor pv. Also each vertex v has its integer value sv. 
Your task is to perform following queries:
  P v u (u ≠ v). If u isn't in subtree of v, you must perform the assignment pv = u. Otherwise you must perform assignment pu = v. Note that after this query the graph continues to be a tree consisting of n vertexes. V v t. Perform assignment sv = t. Your task is following. Before starting performing queries and after each query you have to calculate expected value written on the lowest common ancestor of two equiprobably selected vertices i and j. Here lowest common ancestor of i and j is the deepest vertex that lies on the both of the path from the root to vertex i and the path from the root to vertex j. Please note that the vertices i and j can be the same (in this case their lowest common ancestor coincides with them).

Input
The first line of the input contains integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 5·10^4) — the number of the tree vertexes. 
The second line contains n - 1 integer p2, p3, ..., pn (1 ≤ pi ≤ n) — the description of the tree edges. It is guaranteed that those numbers form a tree.
The third line contains n integers — s1, s2, ... sn (0 ≤ si ≤ 10^6) — the values written on each vertex of the tree.
The next line contains integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 5·10^4) — the number of queries. Each of the following q lines contains the description of the query in the format described in the statement. It is guaranteed that query arguments u and v lie between 1 and n. It is guaranteed that argument t in the queries of type V meets limits 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^6.

Output
Print q + 1 number — the corresponding expected values. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10^-9.

Note
Note that in the query P v u if u lies in subtree of v you must perform assignment pu = v. An example of such case is the last query in the sample.
