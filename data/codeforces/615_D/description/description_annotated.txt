Ayrat has number †n‡, represented as it's prime factorization †p‡†i‡ of size †m‡, i.e. †n‡ = †p‡1·†p‡2·...·†p‡†m‡. Ayrat got secret information that that the product of all divisors of †n‡ taken modulo 10^9 + 7 is the password to the secret data base. Now he wants to calculate this value.

Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer †m‡ (1 ≤ †m‡ ≤ 200 000) — the number of primes in factorization of †n‡. 
The second line contains †m‡ primes numbers †p‡†i‡ (2 ≤ †p‡†i‡ ≤ 200 000).

Output
Print one integer — the product of all divisors of †n‡ modulo 10^9 + 7.

2 3 2

Output
1728


Note
In the first sample †n‡ = 2·3 = 6. The divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3 and 6, their product is equal to 1·2·3·6 = 36.
In the second sample 2·3·2 = 12. The divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12. 1·2·3·4·6·12 = 1728.
