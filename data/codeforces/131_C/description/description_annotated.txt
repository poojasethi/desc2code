There are †n‡ boys and †m‡ girls attending a theatre club. To set a play "The Big Bang Theory", they need to choose a group containing exactly †t‡ actors containing no less than 4 boys and no less than one girl. How many ways are there to choose a group? Of course, the variants that only differ in the composition of the troupe are considered different.
Perform all calculations in the 64-bit type: long long for С/С++, int64 for Delphi and long for Java.

Input
The only line of the input data contains three integers †n‡, †m‡, †t‡ (4 ≤ †n‡ ≤ 30, 1 ≤ †m‡ ≤ 30, 5 ≤ †t‡ ≤ †n‡ + †m‡).

Output
Find the required number of ways.
Please do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use cin, cout streams or the %I64d specificator.
