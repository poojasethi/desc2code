Yaroslav has an array that consists of n integers. In one second Yaroslav can swap two neighboring array elements. Now Yaroslav is wondering if he can obtain an array where any two neighboring elements would be distinct in a finite time.
Help Yaroslav.

Input
The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in the array. The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 1000) — the array elements.

Output
In the single line print "YES" (without the quotes) if Yaroslav can obtain the array he needs, and "NO" (without the quotes) otherwise.

Examples
Input
1
1

Output
YES

Input
3
1 1 2

Output
YES

Input
4
7 7 7 7

Output
NO


Note
In the first sample the initial array fits well.
In the second sample Yaroslav can get array: 1, 2, 1. He can swap the last and the second last elements to obtain it.
In the third sample Yarosav can't get the array he needs.
