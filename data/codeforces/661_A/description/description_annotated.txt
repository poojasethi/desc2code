Lazy caterer sequence is defined as the maximum number of pieces formed when slicing a convex pancake with †n‡ cuts (each cut is a straight line). The formula is †C‡†n‡ = †n‡·(†n‡ + 1) / 2 + 1. You are given †n‡; calculate †n‡-th element of the sequence.

Input
The only line of the input contains an integer †n‡ (0 ≤ †n‡ ≤ 100).

Output
Output the †n‡-th element of lazy caterer sequence.
