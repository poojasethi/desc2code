Gena loves sequences of numbers. Recently, he has discovered a new type of sequences which he called an almost arithmetical progression. A sequence is an almost arithmetical progression, if its elements can be represented as:
  a1 = p, where p is some integer;  ai = ai - 1 + ( - 1)^i+1·q (i > 1), where q is some integer. Right now Gena has a piece of paper with sequence b, consisting of n integers. Help Gena, find there the longest subsequence of integers that is an almost arithmetical progression.
Sequence s1,  s2,  ...,  sk is a subsequence of sequence b1,  b2,  ...,  bn, if there is such increasing sequence of indexes i1, i2, ..., ik (1  ≤  i1  <  i2  < ...   <  ik  ≤  n), that bij  =  sj. In other words, sequence s can be obtained from b by crossing out some elements.

Input
The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 4000). The next line contains n integers b1, b2, ..., bn (1 ≤ bi ≤ 10^6).

Output
Print a single integer — the length of the required longest subsequence.

Examples
Input
2
3 5

Output
2

Input
4
10 20 10 30

Output
3


Note
In the first test the sequence actually is the suitable subsequence. 
In the second test the following subsequence fits: 10, 20, 10.
