Gena loves sequences of numbers. Recently, he has discovered a new type of sequences which he called an almost arithmetical progression. A sequence is an almost arithmetical progression, if its elements can be represented as:
  †a‡1 = †p‡, where †p‡ is some integer;  †a‡†i‡ = †a‡†i‡ - 1 + ( - 1)^†i‡+1·†q‡ (†i‡ > 1), where †q‡ is some integer. Right now Gena has a piece of paper with sequence †b‡, consisting of †n‡ integers. Help Gena, find there the longest subsequence of integers that is an almost arithmetical progression.
Sequence †s‡1,  †s‡2,  ...,  †s‡†k‡ is a subsequence of sequence †b‡1,  †b‡2,  ...,  †b‡†n‡, if there is such increasing sequence of indexes †i‡1, †i‡2, ..., †i‡†k‡ (1  ≤  †i‡1  <  †i‡2  < ...   <  †i‡†k‡  ≤  †n‡), that †b‡†i‡†j‡  =  †s‡†j‡. In other words, sequence †s‡ can be obtained from †b‡ by crossing out some elements.

Input
The first line contains integer †n‡ (1 ≤ †n‡ ≤ 4000). The next line contains †n‡ integers †b‡1, †b‡2, ..., †b‡†n‡ (1 ≤ †b‡†i‡ ≤ 10^6).

Output
Print a single integer — the length of the required longest subsequence.

Examples
Input
2
3 5

Output

Input
4
10 20 10 30

Output
3


Note
In the first test the sequence actually is the suitable subsequence. 
In the second test the following subsequence fits: 10, 20, 10.
