You've got an †n‡ × †n‡ × †n‡ cube, split into unit cubes. Your task is to number all unit cubes in this cube with positive integers from 1 to †n‡^3 so that: 
  each number was used as a cube's number exactly once;  for each 1 ≤ †i‡ < †n‡^3, unit cubes with numbers †i‡ and †i‡ + 1 were neighbouring (that is, shared a side);  for each 1 ≤ †i‡ < †n‡ there were at least two different subcubes with sizes †i‡ × †i‡ × †i‡, made from unit cubes, which are numbered with consecutive numbers. That is, there are such two numbers †x‡ and †y‡, that the unit cubes of the first subcube are numbered by numbers †x‡, †x‡ + 1, ..., †x‡ + †i‡^3 - 1, and the unit cubes of the second subcube are numbered by numbers †y‡, †y‡ + 1, ..., †y‡ + †i‡^3 - 1. Find and print the required numeration of unit cubes of the cube.

Input
The first line contains a single integer †n‡ (1 ≤ †n‡ ≤ 50) — the size of the cube, whose unit cubes need to be numbered.

Output
Print all layers of the cube as †n‡ †n‡ × †n‡ matrices. Separate them with new lines. Print the layers in the order in which they follow in the cube. See the samples for clarifications. 
It is guaranteed that there always is a solution that meets the conditions given in the problem statement.
