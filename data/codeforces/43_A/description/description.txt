One day Vasya decided to have a look at the results of Berland 1910 Football Championship’s finals. Unfortunately he didn't find the overall score of the match; however, he got hold of a profound description of the match's process. On the whole there are n lines in that description each of which described one goal. Every goal was marked with the name of the team that had scored it. Help Vasya, learn the name of the team that won the finals. It is guaranteed that the match did not end in a tie.

It is guaranteed that the match did not end in a tie and the description contains no more than two different teams.
