Nick's company employed †n‡ people. Now Nick needs to build a tree hierarchy of «supervisor-surbodinate» relations in the company (this is to say that each employee, except one, has exactly one supervisor). There are †m‡ applications written in the following form: «employee †a‡†i‡ is ready to become a supervisor of employee †b‡†i‡ at extra cost †c‡†i‡». The qualification †q‡†j‡ of each employee is known, and for each application the following is true: †q‡†a‡†i‡ > †q‡†b‡†i‡. 
Would you help Nick calculate the minimum cost of such a hierarchy, or find out that it is impossible to build it.

Input
The first input line contains integer †n‡ (1 ≤ †n‡ ≤ 1000) — amount of employees in the company. The following line contains †n‡ space-separated numbers †q‡†j‡ (0 ≤ †q‡†j‡ ≤ 10^6)— the employees' qualifications. The following line contains number †m‡ (0 ≤ †m‡ ≤ 10000) — amount of received applications. The following †m‡ lines contain the applications themselves, each of them in the form of three space-separated numbers: †a‡†i‡, †b‡†i‡ and †c‡†i‡ (1 ≤ †a‡†i‡, †b‡†i‡ ≤ †n‡, 0 ≤ †c‡†i‡ ≤ 10^6). Different applications can be similar, i.e. they can come from one and the same employee who offered to become a supervisor of the same person but at a different cost. For each application †q‡†a‡†i‡ > †q‡†b‡†i‡.

Output
Output the only line — the minimum cost of building such a hierarchy, or -1 if it is impossible to build it.

Examples
Input

7 2 3 1
4
1 2 5
2 4 1
3 4 1
1 3 5

Output
11

Input
3
1 2 3

3 1 2
3 1 3

Output
-1


Note
In the first sample one of the possible ways for building a hierarchy is to take applications with indexes 1, 2 and 4, which give 11 as the minimum total cost. In the second sample it is impossible to build the required hierarchy, so the answer is -1.
