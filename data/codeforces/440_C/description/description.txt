Prof. Vasechkin wants to represent positive integer n as a sum of addends, where each addends is an integer number containing only 1s. For example, he can represent 121 as 121=111+11+–1. Help him to find the least number of digits 1 in such sum.

Input
The first line of the input contains integer n (1 ≤ n < 10^15).

Output
Print expected minimal number of digits 1.
