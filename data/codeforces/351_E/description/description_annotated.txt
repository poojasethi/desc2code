Jeff's friends know full well that the boy likes to get sequences and arrays for his birthday. Thus, Jeff got sequence †p‡1, †p‡2, ..., †p‡†n‡ for his birthday.
Jeff hates inversions in sequences. An inversion in sequence †a‡1, †a‡2, ..., †a‡†n‡ is a pair of indexes †i‡, †j‡ (1 ≤ †i‡ < †j‡ ≤ †n‡), such that an inequality †a‡†i‡ > †a‡†j‡ holds.
Jeff can multiply some numbers of the sequence †p‡ by -1. At that, he wants the number of inversions in the sequence to be minimum. Help Jeff and find the minimum number of inversions he manages to get.

Input
The first line contains integer †n‡ (1 ≤ †n‡ ≤ 2000). The next line contains †n‡ integers — sequence †p‡1, †p‡2, ..., †p‡†n‡ (|†p‡†i‡| ≤ 10^5). The numbers are separated by spaces.

Output
In a single line print the answer to the problem — the minimum number of inversions Jeff can get.
