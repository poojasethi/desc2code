†n‡ soldiers stand in a circle. For each soldier his height †a‡†i‡ is known. A reconnaissance unit can be made of such two neighbouring soldiers, whose heights difference is minimal, i.e. |†a‡†i‡ - †a‡†j‡| is minimal. So each of them will be less noticeable with the other. Output any pair of soldiers that can form a reconnaissance unit.

Input
The first line contains integer †n‡ (2 ≤ †n‡ ≤ 100) — amount of soldiers. Then follow the heights of the soldiers in their order in the circle — †n‡ space-separated integers †a‡1, †a‡2, ..., †a‡†n‡ (1 ≤ †a‡†i‡ ≤ 1000). The soldier heights are given in clockwise or counterclockwise direction.

Output
Output two integers — indexes of neighbouring soldiers, who should form a reconnaissance unit. If there are many optimum solutions, output any of them. Remember, that the soldiers stand in a circle.
