Of course, many of you can calculate φ(n) — the number of positive integers that are less than or equal to n, that are coprime with n. But what if we need to calculate φ(φ(...φ(n))), where function φ is taken k times and n is given in the canonical decomposition into prime factors? 
You are given n and k, calculate the value of φ(φ(...φ(n))). Print the result in the canonical decomposition into prime factors.

Input
The first line contains integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5) — the number of distinct prime divisors in the canonical representaion of n.
Each of the next m lines contains a pair of space-separated integers pi, ai (2 ≤ pi ≤ 10^6; 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^17) — another prime divisor of number n and its power in the canonical representation. The sum of all ai doesn't exceed 10^17. Prime divisors in the input follow in the strictly increasing order.
The last line contains integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18).

Output
In the first line, print integer w — the number of distinct prime divisors of number φ(φ(...φ(n))), where function φ is taken k times.
Each of the next w lines must contain two space-separated integers qi, bi (bi ≥ 1) — another prime divisor and its power in the canonical representaion of the result. Numbers qi must go in the strictly increasing order.
