Iahub and Iahubina went to a picnic in a forest full of trees. Less than 5 minutes passed before Iahub remembered of trees from programming. Moreover, he invented a new problem and Iahubina has to solve it, otherwise Iahub won't give her the food. 
Iahub asks Iahubina: can you build a rooted tree, such that
  each internal node (a node with at least one son) has at least two sons;  node †i‡ has †c‡†i‡ nodes in its subtree? Iahubina has to guess the tree. Being a smart girl, she realized that it's possible no tree can follow Iahub's restrictions. In this way, Iahub will eat all the food. You need to help Iahubina: determine if there's at least one tree following Iahub's restrictions. The required tree must contain †n‡ nodes.

Input
The first line of the input contains integer †n‡ (1 ≤ †n‡ ≤ 24). Next line contains †n‡ positive integers: the †i‡-th number represents †c‡†i‡ (1 ≤ †c‡†i‡ ≤ †n‡).

Output
Output on the first line "YES" (without quotes) if there exist at least one tree following Iahub's restrictions, otherwise output "NO" (without quotes).
