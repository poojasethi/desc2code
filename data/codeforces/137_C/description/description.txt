Polycarpus likes studying at school a lot and he is always diligent about his homework. Polycarpus has never had any problems with natural sciences as his great-great-grandfather was the great physicist Seinstein. On the other hand though, Polycarpus has never had an easy time with history.
Everybody knows that the World history encompasses exactly n events: the i-th event had continued from the year ai to the year bi inclusive (ai < bi). Polycarpus easily learned the dates when each of n events started and ended (Polycarpus inherited excellent memory from his great-great-granddad). But the teacher gave him a more complicated task: Polycaprus should know when all events began and ended and he should also find out for each event whether it includes another event. Polycarpus' teacher thinks that an event j includes an event i if aj < ai and bi < bj. Your task is simpler: find the number of events that are included in some other event.

Input
The first input line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) which represents the number of events. Next n lines contain descriptions of the historical events, one event per line. The i + 1 line contains two integers ai and bi (1 ≤ ai < bi ≤ 10^9) — the beginning and the end of the i-th event. No two events start or finish in the same year, that is, ai ≠ aj, ai ≠ bj, bi ≠ aj, bi ≠ bj for all i, j (where i ≠ j). Events are given in arbitrary order.

Output
Print the only integer — the answer to the problem.

Input

1 1000000000

Output
0


Note
In the first example the fifth event is contained in the fourth. Similarly, the fourth event is contained in the third, the third — in the second and the second — in the first.
In the second example all events except the first one are contained in the first.
In the third example only one event, so the answer is 0.
