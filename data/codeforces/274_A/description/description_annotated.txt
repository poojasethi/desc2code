A †k‡-multiple free set is a set of integers where there is no pair of integers where one is equal to another integer multiplied by †k‡. That is, there are no two integers †x‡ and †y‡ (†x‡ < †y‡) from the set, such that †y‡ = †x‡·†k‡.
You're given a set of †n‡ distinct positive integers. Your task is to find the size of it's largest †k‡-multiple free subset.

Input
The first line of the input contains two integers †n‡ and †k‡ (1 ≤ †n‡ ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ †k‡ ≤ 10^9). The next line contains a list of †n‡ distinct positive integers †a‡1, †a‡2, ..., †a‡†n‡ (1 ≤ †a‡†i‡ ≤ 10^9).
All the numbers in the lines are separated by single spaces.

Output
On the only line of the output print the size of the largest †k‡-multiple free subset of {†a‡1, †a‡2, ..., †a‡†n‡}.

Examples
Input
6 2
2 3 6 5 4 10

Output
3


Note
In the sample input one of the possible maximum 2-multiple free subsets is {4, 5, 6}.
