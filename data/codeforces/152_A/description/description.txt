Vasya, or Mr. Vasily Petrov is a dean of a department in a local university. After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.
Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.
Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.
Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.

Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.
