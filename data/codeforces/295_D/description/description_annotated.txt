Greg has a pad. The pad's screen is an †n‡ × †m‡ rectangle, each cell can be either black or white. We'll consider the pad rows to be numbered with integers from 1 to †n‡ from top to bottom. Similarly, the pad's columns are numbered with integers from 1 to †m‡ from left to right.
Greg thinks that the pad's screen displays a cave if the following conditions hold:
  There is a segment [†l‡, †r‡] (1 ≤ †l‡ ≤ †r‡ ≤ †n‡), such that each of the rows †l‡, †l‡ + 1, ..., †r‡ has exactly two black cells and all other rows have only white cells.  There is a row number †t‡ (†l‡ ≤ †t‡ ≤ †r‡), such that for all pairs of rows with numbers †i‡ and †j‡ (†l‡ ≤ †i‡ ≤ †j‡ ≤ †t‡) the set of columns between the black cells in row †i‡ (with the columns where is these black cells) is the subset of the set of columns between the black cells in row †j‡ (with the columns where is these black cells). Similarly, for all pairs of rows with numbers †i‡ and †j‡ (†t‡ ≤ †i‡ ≤ †j‡ ≤ †r‡) the set of columns between the black cells in row †j‡ (with the columns where is these black cells) is the subset of the set of columns between the black cells in row †i‡ (with the columns where is these black cells). Greg wondered, how many ways there are to paint a cave on his pad. Two ways can be considered distinct if there is a cell that has distinct colors on the two pictures.
Help Greg.

Input
The first line contains two integers †n‡, †m‡ — the pad's screen size (1 ≤ †n‡, †m‡ ≤ 2000).

Output
In the single line print the remainder after dividing the answer to the problem by 1000000007 (10^9 + 7).
