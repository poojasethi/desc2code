Iahub got bored, so he invented a game to be played on paper. 
He writes †n‡ integers †a‡1, †a‡2, ..., †a‡†n‡. Each of those integers can be either 0 or 1. He's allowed to do exactly one move: he chooses two indices †i‡ and †j‡ (1 ≤ †i‡ ≤ †j‡ ≤ †n‡) and flips all values †a‡†k‡ for which their positions are in range [†i‡, †j‡] (that is †i‡ ≤ †k‡ ≤ †j‡). Flip the value of †x‡ means to apply operation †x‡ = 1 - †x‡.
The goal of the game is that after exactly one move to obtain the maximum number of ones. Write a program to solve the little game of Iahub.

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer †n‡ (1 ≤ †n‡ ≤ 100). In the second line of the input there are †n‡ integers: †a‡1, †a‡2, ..., †a‡†n‡. It is guaranteed that each of those †n‡ values is either 0 or 1.

Output
Print an integer — the maximal number of 1s that can be obtained after exactly one move. 

Examples
Input
5
1 0 0 1 0

Output
4

Input
4
1 0 0 1

Output
4


Note
In the first case, flip the segment from 2 to 5 (†i‡ = 2, †j‡ = 5). That flip changes the sequence, it becomes: [1 1 1 0 1]. So, it contains four ones. There is no way to make the whole sequence equal to [1 1 1 1 1].
In the second case, flipping only the second and the third element (†i‡ = 2, †j‡ = 3) will turn all numbers into 1.
