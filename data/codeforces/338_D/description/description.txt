Consider a table G of size n × m such that G(i, j) = GCD(i, j) for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ j ≤ m. GCD(a, b) is the greatest common divisor of numbers a and b.
You have a sequence of positive integer numbers a1, a2, ..., ak. We say that this sequence occurs in table G if it coincides with consecutive elements in some row, starting from some position. More formally, such numbers 1 ≤ i ≤ n and 1 ≤ j ≤ m - k + 1 should exist that G(i, j + l - 1) = al for all 1 ≤ l ≤ k.
Determine if the sequence a occurs in table G.

Input
The first line contains three space-separated integers n, m and k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^12; 1 ≤ k ≤ 10000). The second line contains k space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., ak (1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^12).

Output
Print a single word "YES", if the given sequence occurs in table G, otherwise print "NO".

Examples
Input
100 100 5
5 2 1 2 1

Output
YES

Input
100 8 5
5 2 1 2 1

Output
NO

Input
100 100 7
1 2 3 4 5 6 7

Output
NO


Note
Sample 1. The tenth row of table G starts from sequence {1, 2, 1, 2, 5, 2, 1, 2, 1, 10}. As you can see, elements from fifth to ninth coincide with sequence a.
Sample 2. This time the width of table G equals 8. Sequence a doesn't occur there.
