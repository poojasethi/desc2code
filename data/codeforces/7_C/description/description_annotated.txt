A line on the plane is described by an equation †Ax‡ + †By‡ + †C‡ = 0. You are to find any point on this line, whose coordinates are integer numbers from  - 5·10^18 to 5·10^18 inclusive, or to find out that such points do not exist.

Input
The first line contains three integers †A‡, †B‡ and †C‡ ( - 2·10^9 ≤ †A‡, †B‡, †C‡ ≤ 2·10^9) — corresponding coefficients of the line equation. It is guaranteed that †A‡^2 + †B‡^2 > 0.

Output
If the required point exists, output its coordinates, otherwise output -1.

Examples
Input
2 5 3

Output
6 -3
