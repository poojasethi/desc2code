Polycarpus loves hamburgers very much. He especially adores the hamburgers he makes with his own hands. Polycarpus thinks that there are only three decent ingredients to make hamburgers from: a bread, sausage and cheese. He writes down the recipe of his favorite "Le Hamburger de Polycarpus" as a string of letters 'B' (bread), 'S' (sausage) и 'C' (cheese). The ingredients in the recipe go from bottom to top, for example, recipe "ВSCBS" represents the hamburger where the ingredients go from bottom to top as bread, sausage, cheese, bread and sausage again.
Polycarpus has †n‡†b‡ pieces of bread, †n‡†s‡ pieces of sausage and †n‡†c‡ pieces of cheese in the kitchen. Besides, the shop nearby has all three ingredients, the prices are †p‡†b‡ rubles for a piece of bread, †p‡†s‡ for a piece of sausage and †p‡†c‡ for a piece of cheese.
Polycarpus has †r‡ rubles and he is ready to shop on them. What maximum number of hamburgers can he cook? You can assume that Polycarpus cannot break or slice any of the pieces of bread, sausage or cheese. Besides, the shop has an unlimited number of pieces of each ingredient.
