Iahub likes chess very much. He even invented a new chess piece named Coder. A Coder can move (and attack) one square horizontally or vertically. More precisely, if the Coder is located at position (x, y), he can move to (or attack) positions (x + 1, y), (x–1, y), (x, y + 1) and (x, y–1).
Iahub wants to know how many Coders can be placed on an n × n chessboard, so that no Coder attacks any other Coder.

Input
The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000).

Output
On the first line print an integer, the maximum number of Coders that can be placed on the chessboard.
On each of the next n lines print n characters, describing the configuration of the Coders. For an empty cell print an '.', and for a Coder print a 'C'.
If there are multiple correct answers, you can print any.

Examples
