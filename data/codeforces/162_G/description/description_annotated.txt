You are given an array of integers written in base †radix‡. Calculate their sum and output it written in the same base.

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer †n‡ (1 ≤ †n‡ ≤ 10) — the size of the array. The second line contains an integer †radix‡ (2 ≤ †radix‡ ≤ 36) — the base of the numeral system used. Next †n‡ lines contain the elements of the array, one per line. 
Each element is a non-negative integer written in †radix‡-based notation, possibly with leading zeros, which contains between 1 and 5 digits, inclusive. The digits of the notation will be 0, 1, ..., 9, A, B, ..., Z in the given order. 

Output
Output the sum of array elements in †radix‡-based notation. Use the same format as in the input.
