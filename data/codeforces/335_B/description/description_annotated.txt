Given a string †s‡, determine if it contains any palindrome of length exactly 100 as a subsequence. If it has any, print any one of them. If it doesn't have any, print a palindrome that is a subsequence of †s‡ and is as long as possible.

Input
The only line of the input contains one string †s‡ of length †n‡ (1 ≤ †n‡ ≤ 5·10^4) containing only lowercase English letters.

Output
If †s‡ contains a palindrome of length exactly 100 as a subsequence, print any palindrome of length 100 which is a subsequence of †s‡. If †s‡ doesn't contain any palindromes of length exactly 100, print a palindrome that is a subsequence of †s‡ and is as long as possible.
If there exists multiple answers, you are allowed to print any of them.

Examples
Input
bbbabcbbb

Output
bbbcbbb

Input
rquwmzexectvnbanemsmdufrg

Output
rumenanemur


Note
A subsequence of a string is a string that can be derived from it by deleting some characters without changing the order of the remaining characters. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward or backward.
