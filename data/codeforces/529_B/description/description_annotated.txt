Many years have passed, and †n‡ friends met at a party again. Technologies have leaped forward since the last meeting, cameras with timer appeared and now it is not obligatory for one of the friends to stand with a camera, and, thus, being absent on the photo.
Simply speaking, the process of photographing can be described as follows. Each friend occupies a rectangle of pixels on the photo: the †i‡-th of them in a standing state occupies a †w‡†i‡ pixels wide and a †h‡†i‡ pixels high rectangle. But also, each person can lie down for the photo, and then he will occupy a †h‡†i‡ pixels wide and a †w‡†i‡ pixels high rectangle.
The total photo will have size †W‡ × †H‡, where †W‡ is the total width of all the people rectangles, and †H‡ is the maximum of the heights. The friends want to determine what minimum area the group photo can they obtain if no more than †n‡ / 2 of them can lie on the ground (it would be strange if more than †n‡ / 2 gentlemen lie on the ground together, isn't it?..)
Help them to achieve this goal.

Input
The first line contains integer †n‡ (1 ≤ †n‡ ≤ 1000) — the number of friends.
The next †n‡ lines have two integers †w‡†i‡, †h‡†i‡ (1 ≤ †w‡†i‡, †h‡†i‡ ≤ 1000) each, representing the size of the rectangle, corresponding to the †i‡-th friend.

Output
Print a single integer equal to the minimum possible area of the photo containing all friends if no more than †n‡ / 2 of them can lie on the ground.
