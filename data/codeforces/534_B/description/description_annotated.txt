The on-board computer on Polycarp's car measured that the car speed at the beginning of some section of the path equals †v‡1 meters per second, and in the end it is †v‡2 meters per second. We know that this section of the route took exactly †t‡ seconds to pass.
Assuming that at each of the seconds the speed is constant, and between seconds the speed can change at most by †d‡ meters per second in absolute value (i.e., the difference in the speed of any two adjacent seconds does not exceed †d‡ in absolute value), find the maximum possible length of the path section in meters.

Input
The first line contains two integers †v‡1 and †v‡2 (1 ≤ †v‡1, †v‡2 ≤ 100) — the speeds in meters per second at the beginning of the segment and at the end of the segment, respectively.
The second line contains two integers †t‡ (2 ≤ †t‡ ≤ 100) — the time when the car moves along the segment in seconds, †d‡ (0 ≤ †d‡ ≤ 10) — the maximum value of the speed change between adjacent seconds.
It is guaranteed that there is a way to complete the segment so that:
  the speed in the first second equals †v‡1,  the speed in the last second equals †v‡2,  the absolute value of difference of speeds between any two adjacent seconds doesn't exceed †d‡. 
Output
Print the maximum possible length of the path segment in meters. 

Examples

26
Input
10 10
10 0

Output
100


Note
In the first sample the sequence of speeds of Polycarpus' car can look as follows: 5, 7, 8, 6. Thus, the total path is 5 + 7 + 8 + 6 = 26 meters.
In the second sample, as †d‡ = 0, the car covers the whole segment at constant speed †v‡ = 10. In †t‡ = 10 seconds it covers the distance of 100 meters.
