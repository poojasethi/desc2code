You are given an array of integers. Check whether there exists a number in this array which is divisible by all other numbers in this array. Output 1, if such a number exists, and 0 otherwise.

Input
The only line of the input contains a list of space-separated integers †a‡†i‡ (1 ≤ †a‡†i‡ ≤ 100) — elements of the array. The size of the array is between 2 and 10, inclusive. Note that the size of the array is not given explicitly!

Output
Output 1 if there exists element of this array which is divisible by all other elements of the array, and 0 otherwise.
