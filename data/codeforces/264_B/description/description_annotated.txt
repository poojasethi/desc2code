Squirrel Liss is interested in sequences. She also has preferences of integers. She thinks †n‡ integers †a‡1, †a‡2, ..., †a‡†n‡ are good.
Now she is interested in good sequences. A sequence †x‡1, †x‡2, ..., †x‡†k‡ is called good if it satisfies the following three conditions:
  The sequence is strictly increasing, i.e. †x‡†i‡ < †x‡†i‡ + 1 for each †i‡ (1 ≤ †i‡ ≤ †k‡ - 1).  No two adjacent elements are coprime, i.e. †gcd‡(†x‡†i‡, †x‡†i‡ + 1) > 1 for each †i‡ (1 ≤ †i‡ ≤ †k‡ - 1) (where †gcd‡(†p‡, †q‡) denotes the greatest common divisor of the integers †p‡ and †q‡).  All elements of the sequence are good integers. Find the length of the longest good sequence.

Input
The input consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer †n‡ (1 ≤ †n‡ ≤ 10^5) — the number of good integers. The second line contains a single-space separated list of good integers †a‡1, †a‡2, ..., †a‡†n‡ in strictly increasing order (1 ≤ †a‡†i‡ ≤ 10^5; †a‡†i‡ < †a‡†i‡ + 1).

Output
Print a single integer — the length of the longest good sequence.

Examples
Input

Output
4

Input
9
1 2 3 5 6 7 8 9 10

Output
4


Note
In the first example, the following sequences are examples of good sequences: [2; 4; 6; 9], [2; 4; 6], [3; 9], [6]. The length of the longest good sequence is 4.
