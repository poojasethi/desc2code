Squirrel Liss is interested in sequences. She also has preferences of integers. She thinks n integers a1, a2, ..., an are good.
Now she is interested in good sequences. A sequence x1, x2, ..., xk is called good if it satisfies the following three conditions:
  The sequence is strictly increasing, i.e. xi < xi + 1 for each i (1 ≤ i ≤ k - 1).  No two adjacent elements are coprime, i.e. gcd(xi, xi + 1) > 1 for each i (1 ≤ i ≤ k - 1) (where gcd(p, q) denotes the greatest common divisor of the integers p and q).  All elements of the sequence are good integers. Find the length of the longest good sequence.

Input
The input consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of good integers. The second line contains a single-space separated list of good integers a1, a2, ..., an in strictly increasing order (1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^5; ai < ai + 1).

Output
Print a single integer — the length of the longest good sequence.

Examples
Input
5
2 3 4 6 9

Output
4

Input
9
1 2 3 5 6 7 8 9 10

Output
4


Note
In the first example, the following sequences are examples of good sequences: [2; 4; 6; 9], [2; 4; 6], [3; 9], [6]. The length of the longest good sequence is 4.
