You are given an array of positive integers †a‡1, †a‡2, ..., †a‡†n‡ × †T‡ of length †n‡ × †T‡. We know that for any †i‡ > †n‡ it is true that †a‡†i‡ = †a‡†i‡ - †n‡. Find the length of the longest non-decreasing sequence of the given array.

Input
The first line contains two space-separated integers: †n‡, †T‡ (1 ≤ †n‡ ≤ 100, 1 ≤ †T‡ ≤ 10^7). The second line contains †n‡ space-separated integers †a‡1, †a‡2, ..., †a‡†n‡ (1 ≤ †a‡†i‡ ≤ 300).

Output
Print a single number — the length of a sought sequence.

Examples
Input
4 3
3 1 4 2

Output
5


Note
The array given in the sample looks like that: 3, 1, 4, 2, 3, 1, 4, 2, 3, 1, 4, 2. The elements in bold form the largest non-decreasing subsequence.
