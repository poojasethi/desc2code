You are given a string †S‡ of length †n‡ with each character being one of the first †m‡ lowercase English letters. 
Calculate how many different strings †T‡ of length †n‡ composed from the first †m‡ lowercase English letters exist such that the length of LCS (longest common subsequence) between †S‡ and †T‡ is †n‡ - 1.
Recall that LCS of two strings †S‡ and †T‡ is the longest string †C‡ such that †C‡ both in †S‡ and †T‡ as a subsequence.

Input
The first line contains two numbers †n‡ and †m‡ denoting the length of string †S‡ and number of first English lowercase characters forming the character set for strings (1 ≤ †n‡ ≤ 100 000, 2 ≤ †m‡ ≤ 26).
The second line contains string †S‡.

Output
Print the only line containing the answer.

Note
For the first sample, the 6 possible strings †T‡ are: aab, aac, aba, aca, baa, caa. 
For the second sample, the 11 possible strings †T‡ are: aaa, aac, aba, abb, abc, aca, acb, baa, bab, caa, cab.
For the third sample, the only possible string †T‡ is b.
