Permutation p is an ordered set of integers p1,  p2,  ...,  pn, consisting of n distinct positive integers, each of them doesn't exceed n. We'll denote the i-th element of permutation p as pi. We'll call number n the size or the length of permutation p1,  p2,  ...,  pn.
The decreasing coefficient of permutation p1, p2, ..., pn is the number of such i (1 ≤ i < n), that pi > pi + 1.
You have numbers n and k. Your task is to print the permutation of length n with decreasing coefficient k.

Input
The single line contains two space-separated integers: n, k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ k < n) — the permutation length and the decreasing coefficient.

Output
In a single line print n space-separated integers: p1, p2, ..., pn — the permutation of length n with decreasing coefficient k. 
If there are several permutations that meet this condition, print any of them. It is guaranteed that the permutation with the sought parameters exists.
