Permutation †p‡ is an ordered set of integers †p‡1,  †p‡2,  ...,  †p‡†n‡, consisting of †n‡ distinct positive integers, each of them doesn't exceed †n‡. We'll denote the †i‡-th element of permutation †p‡ as †p‡†i‡. We'll call number †n‡ the size or the length of permutation †p‡1,  †p‡2,  ...,  †p‡†n‡.
The decreasing coefficient of permutation †p‡1, †p‡2, ..., †p‡†n‡ is the number of such †i‡ (1 ≤ †i‡ < †n‡), that †p‡†i‡ > †p‡†i‡ + 1.
You have numbers †n‡ and †k‡. Your task is to print the permutation of length †n‡ with decreasing coefficient †k‡.

Input
The single line contains two space-separated integers: †n‡, †k‡ (1 ≤ †n‡ ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ †k‡ < †n‡) — the permutation length and the decreasing coefficient.

Output
In a single line print †n‡ space-separated integers: †p‡1, †p‡2, ..., †p‡†n‡ — the permutation of length †n‡ with decreasing coefficient †k‡. 
If there are several permutations that meet this condition, print any of them. It is guaranteed that the permutation with the sought parameters exists.
