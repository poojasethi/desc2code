One day Ms Swan bought an orange in a shop. The orange consisted of n·k segments, numbered with integers from 1 to n·k. 
There were k children waiting for Ms Swan at home. The children have recently learned about the orange and they decided to divide it between them. For that each child took a piece of paper and wrote the number of the segment that he would like to get: the i-th (1 ≤ i ≤ k) child wrote the number ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ n·k). All numbers ai accidentally turned out to be different.
Now the children wonder, how to divide the orange so as to meet these conditions:
  each child gets exactly n orange segments;  the i-th child gets the segment with number ai for sure;  no segment goes to two children simultaneously. Help the children, divide the orange and fulfill the requirements, described above.

Input
The first line contains two integers n, k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 30). The second line contains k space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., ak (1 ≤ ai ≤ n·k), where ai is the number of the orange segment that the i-th child would like to get.
It is guaranteed that all numbers ai are distinct.

Output
Print exactly n·k distinct integers. The first n integers represent the indexes of the segments the first child will get, the second n integers represent the indexes of the segments the second child will get, and so on. Separate the printed numbers with whitespaces.
You can print a child's segment indexes in any order. It is guaranteed that the answer always exists. If there are multiple correct answers, print any of them.
