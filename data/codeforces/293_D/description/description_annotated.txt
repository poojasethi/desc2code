Ksusha is a vigorous mathematician. She is keen on absolutely incredible mathematical riddles. 
Today Ksusha came across a convex polygon of non-zero area. She is now wondering: if she chooses a pair of distinct points uniformly among all integer points (points with integer coordinates) inside or on the border of the polygon and then draws a square with two opposite vertices lying in the chosen points, what will the expectation of this square's area be?
A pair of distinct points is chosen uniformly among all pairs of distinct points, located inside or on the border of the polygon. Pairs of points †p‡, †q‡ (†p‡ ≠ †q‡) and †q‡, †p‡ are considered the same.
Help Ksusha! Count the required expectation.

Input
The first line contains integer †n‡ (3 ≤ †n‡ ≤ 10^5) — the number of vertices of Ksusha's convex polygon. Next †n‡ lines contain the coordinates of the polygon vertices in clockwise or counterclockwise order. The †i‡-th line contains integers †x‡†i‡, †y‡†i‡ (|†x‡†i‡|, |†y‡†i‡| ≤ 10^6) — the coordinates of the vertex that goes †i‡-th in that order.

Output
Print a single real number — the required expected area. 
The answer will be considered correct if its absolute and relative error doesn't exceed 10^-6.
