Cosider a sequence, consisting of n integers: a1, a2, ..., an. Jeff can perform the following operation on sequence a:
  take three integers v, t, k (1 ≤ v, t ≤ n; 0 ≤ k; v + tk ≤ n), such that av = av + t, av + t = av + 2t, ..., av + t(k - 1) = av + tk;  remove elements av, av + t, ..., av + t·k from the sequence a, the remaining elements should be reindexed a1, a2, ..., an - k - 1.  permute in some order the remaining elements of sequence a. A beauty of a sequence a is the minimum number of operations that is needed to delete all elements from sequence a.
Jeff's written down a sequence of m integers b1, b2, ..., bm. Now he wants to ask q questions. Each question can be described with two integers li, ri. The answer to the question is the beauty of sequence bli, bli + 1, ..., bri. You are given the sequence b and all questions. Help Jeff, answer all his questions.

Input
The first line contains integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5). The next line contains m integers b1, b2, ..., bm (1 ≤ bi ≤ 10^5). 
The third line contains integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5) — the number of questions. The next q lines contain pairs of integers, i-th of them contains a pair of integers li, ri (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ m) — the description of i-th question.

Output
In q lines print the answers to Jeff's queries. Print the answers according to the order of questions in input.
