A group of †n‡ merry programmers celebrate Robert Floyd's birthday. Polucarpus has got an honourable task of pouring Ber-Cola to everybody. Pouring the same amount of Ber-Cola to everybody is really important. In other words, the drink's volume in each of the †n‡ mugs must be the same.
Polycarpus has already began the process and he partially emptied the Ber-Cola bottle. Now the first mug has †a‡1 milliliters of the drink, the second one has †a‡2 milliliters and so on. The bottle has †b‡ milliliters left and Polycarpus plans to pour them into the mugs so that the main equation was fulfilled.
Write a program that would determine what volume of the drink Polycarpus needs to add into each mug to ensure that the following two conditions were fulfilled simultaneously: 
  there were †b‡ milliliters poured in total. That is, the bottle need to be emptied;  after the process is over, the volumes of the drink in the mugs should be equal. 
Input
The first line contains a pair of integers †n‡, †b‡ (2 ≤ †n‡ ≤ 100, 1 ≤ †b‡ ≤ 100), where †n‡ is the total number of friends in the group and †b‡ is the current volume of drink in the bottle. The second line contains a sequence of integers †a‡1, †a‡2, ..., †a‡†n‡ (0 ≤ †a‡†i‡ ≤ 100), where †a‡†i‡ is the current volume of drink in the †i‡-th mug.

Output
Print a single number "-1" (without the quotes), if there is no solution. Otherwise, print †n‡ float numbers †c‡1, †c‡2, ..., †c‡†n‡, where †c‡†i‡ is the volume of the drink to add in the †i‡-th mug. Print the numbers with no less than 6 digits after the decimal point, print each †c‡†i‡ on a single line. Polycarpus proved that if a solution exists then it is unique.
Russian locale is installed by default on the testing computer. Make sure that your solution use the point to separate the integer part of a real number from the decimal, not a comma.
