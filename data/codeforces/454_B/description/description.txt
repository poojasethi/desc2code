One day, Twilight Sparkle is interested in how to sort a sequence of integers a1, a2, ..., an in non-decreasing order. Being a young unicorn, the only operation she can perform is a unit shift. That is, she can move the last element of the sequence to its beginning:
a1, a2, ..., an → an, a1, a2, ..., an - 1.
 Help Twilight Sparkle to calculate: what is the minimum number of operations that she needs to sort the sequence?

Input
The first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^5).

Output
If it's impossible to sort the sequence output -1. Otherwise output the minimum number of operations Twilight Sparkle needs to sort it.
