One day, Twilight Sparkle is interested in how to sort a sequence of integers †a‡1, †a‡2, ..., †a‡†n‡ in non-decreasing order. Being a young unicorn, the only operation she can perform is a unit shift. That is, she can move the last element of the sequence to its beginning:
†a‡1, †a‡2, ..., †a‡†n‡ → †a‡†n‡, †a‡1, †a‡2, ..., †a‡†n‡ - 1.
 Help Twilight Sparkle to calculate: what is the minimum number of operations that she needs to sort the sequence?

Input
The first line contains an integer †n‡ (2 ≤ †n‡ ≤ 10^5). The second line contains †n‡ integer numbers †a‡1, †a‡2, ..., †a‡†n‡ (1 ≤ †a‡†i‡ ≤ 10^5).

Output
If it's impossible to sort the sequence output -1. Otherwise output the minimum number of operations Twilight Sparkle needs to sort it.
