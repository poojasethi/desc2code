Petya loves lucky numbers. Everybody knows that lucky numbers are positive integers whose decimal representation contains only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not.
One day Petya dreamt of a lexicographically k-th permutation of integers from 1 to n. Determine how many lucky numbers in the permutation are located on the positions whose indexes are also lucky numbers.

Input
The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^9) — the number of elements in the permutation and the lexicographical number of the permutation.

Output
If the k-th permutation of numbers from 1 to n does not exist, print the single number "-1" (without the quotes). Otherwise, print the answer to the problem: the number of such indexes i, that i and ai are both lucky numbers.

Examples
Input
7 4

Output
1

Input
4 7

Output
1


Note
A permutation is an ordered set of n elements, where each integer from 1 to n occurs exactly once. The element of permutation in position with index i is denoted as ai (1 ≤ i ≤ n). Permutation a is lexicographically smaller that permutation b if there is such a i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), that ai < bi, and for any j (1 ≤ j < i) aj = bj. Let's make a list of all possible permutations of n elements and sort it in the order of lexicographical increasing. Then the lexicographically k-th permutation is the k-th element of this list of permutations.
In the first sample the permutation looks like that:
1 2 3 4 6 7 5
The only suitable position is 4.
In the second sample the permutation looks like that:
2 1 3 4
The only suitable position is 4.
