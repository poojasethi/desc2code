There are †n‡ piles of pebbles on the table, the †i‡-th pile contains †a‡†i‡ pebbles. Your task is to paint each pebble using one of the †k‡ given colors so that for each color †c‡ and any two piles †i‡ and †j‡ the difference between the number of pebbles of color †c‡ in pile †i‡ and number of pebbles of color †c‡ in pile †j‡ is at most one.
In other words, let's say that †b‡†i‡, †c‡ is the number of pebbles of color †c‡ in the †i‡-th pile. Then for any 1 ≤ †c‡ ≤ †k‡, 1 ≤ †i‡, †j‡ ≤ †n‡ the following condition must be satisfied |†b‡†i‡, †c‡ - †b‡†j‡, †c‡| ≤ 1. It isn't necessary to use all †k‡ colors: if color †c‡ hasn't been used in pile †i‡, then †b‡†i‡, †c‡ is considered to be zero.

Input
The first line of the input contains positive integers †n‡ and †k‡ (1 ≤ †n‡, †k‡ ≤ 100), separated by a space — the number of piles and the number of colors respectively.
The second line contains †n‡ positive integers †a‡1, †a‡2, ..., †a‡†n‡ (1 ≤ †a‡†i‡ ≤ 100) denoting number of pebbles in each of the piles.

Output
If there is no way to paint the pebbles satisfying the given condition, output "NO" (without quotes) .
Otherwise in the first line output "YES" (without quotes). Then †n‡ lines should follow, the †i‡-th of them should contain †a‡†i‡ space-separated integers. †j‡-th (1 ≤ †j‡ ≤ †a‡†i‡) of these integers should be equal to the color of the †j‡-th pebble in the †i‡-th pile. If there are several possible answers, you may output any of them.
