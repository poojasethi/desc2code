A TV show called "Guess a number!" is gathering popularity. The whole Berland, the old and the young, are watching the show.
The rules are simple. The host thinks of an integer y and the participants guess it by asking questions to the host. There are four types of acceptable questions:
  Is it true that y is strictly larger than number x?  Is it true that y is strictly smaller than number x?  Is it true that y is larger than or equal to number x?  Is it true that y is smaller than or equal to number x? On each question the host answers truthfully, "yes" or "no".
Given the sequence of questions and answers, find any integer value of y that meets the criteria of all answers. If there isn't such value, print "Impossible".

Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10000) — the number of questions (and answers). Next n lines each contain one question and one answer to it. The format of each line is like that: "sign x answer", where the sign is:
  ">" (for the first type queries),  "<" (for the second type queries),  ">=" (for the third type queries),  "<=" (for the fourth type queries). All values of x are integer and meet the inequation  - 10^9 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. The answer is an English letter "Y" (for "yes") or "N" (for "no").
Consequtive elements in lines are separated by a single space.

Output
Print any of such integers y, that the answers to all the queries are correct. The printed number y must meet the inequation  - 2·10^9 ≤ y ≤ 2·10^9. If there are many answers, print any of them. If such value doesn't exist, print word "Impossible" (without the quotes).
