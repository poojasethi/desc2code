You are given a sequence of n integers a1, a2, ..., an. 
Determine a real number x such that the weakness of the sequence a1 - x, a2 - x, ..., an - x is as small as possible.
The weakness of a sequence is defined as the maximum value of the poorness over all segments (contiguous subsequences) of a sequence.
The poorness of a segment is defined as the absolute value of sum of the elements of segment.

Input
The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000), the length of a sequence.
The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (|ai| ≤ 10 000).

Output
Output a real number denoting the minimum possible weakness of a1 - x, a2 - x, ..., an - x. Your answer will be considered correct if its relative or absolute error doesn't exceed 10^-6.

Note
For the first case, the optimal value of x is 2 so the sequence becomes  - 1, 0, 1 and the max poorness occurs at the segment "-1" or segment "1". The poorness value (answer) equals to 1 in this case. 
For the second sample the optimal value of x is 2.5 so the sequence becomes  - 1.5,  - 0.5, 0.5, 1.5 and the max poorness occurs on segment "-1.5 -0.5" or "0.5 1.5". The poorness value (answer) equals to 2 in this case.
