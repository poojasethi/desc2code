Petya is an unexperienced programming contestant. Recently he has come across the following problem:
You are given a non-directed graph which consists of †n‡ nodes and †m‡ edges. Your task is to determine whether the graph contains a Hamiltonian path.
Petya wrote a quick bug-free code which he believes solves this problem. After that Petya decided to give this problem for April Fools Day contest. Unfortunately, Petya might have made a mistake, and it's quite possible that his algorithm is wrong. But this isn't a good excuse to leave the contest without submitting this problem, is it?

Input
The first line contains two integers †n‡, †m‡ (1 ≤ †n‡ ≤ 20; 0 ≤ †m‡ ≤ 400). Next †m‡ lines contain pairs of integers †v‡†i‡, †u‡†i‡ (1 ≤ †v‡†i‡, †u‡†i‡ ≤ †n‡).

Output
Follow the format of Petya's code output.
