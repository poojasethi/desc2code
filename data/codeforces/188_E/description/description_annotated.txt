HQ9+ is a joke programming language which has only four one-character instructions:
 "H" prints "Hello, World!", "Q" prints the whole source code of the program itself (at each call), "9" prints the lyrics of "99 Bottles of Beer" song,  "+" increments the value stored in the internal accumulator.Instructions "H" and "Q" are case-sensitive and must be uppercase. The characters of the program which are not instructions are ignored.
You are given a program written in HQ9+. You have to figure out whether executing this program will produce any output.

Input
The input will consist of a single line †p‡ which will give a program in HQ9+. String †p‡ will contain between 1 and 100 characters, inclusive. ASCII-code of each character of †p‡ will be between 33 (exclamation mark) and 126 (tilde), inclusive.

Output
Output "YES", if executing the program will produce any output, and "NO" otherwise (quotes for clarity only).

Examples
Input
Hello!

Output
YES

Input
Progopedia

Output
NO


Note
In the first case the program contains only one instruction — "H", which prints "Hello, World!".
In the second case none of the program characters are language instructions.
