A burglar got into a matches warehouse and wants to steal as many matches as possible. In the warehouse there are †m‡ containers, in the †i‡-th container there are †a‡†i‡ matchboxes, and each matchbox contains †b‡†i‡ matches. All the matchboxes are of the same size. The burglar's rucksack can hold †n‡ matchboxes exactly. Your task is to find out the maximum amount of matches that a burglar can carry away. He has no time to rearrange matches in the matchboxes, that's why he just chooses not more than †n‡ matchboxes so that the total amount of matches in them is maximal.

Input
The first line of the input contains integer †n‡ (1 ≤ †n‡ ≤ 2·10^8) and integer †m‡ (1 ≤ †m‡ ≤ 20). The †i‡ + 1-th line contains a pair of numbers †a‡†i‡ and †b‡†i‡ (1 ≤ †a‡†i‡ ≤ 10^8, 1 ≤ †b‡†i‡ ≤ 10). All the input numbers are integer.

Output
Output the only number — answer to the problem.
