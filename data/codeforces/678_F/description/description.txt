Lena is a programmer. She got a task to solve at work.
There is an empty set of pairs of integers and n queries to process. Each query is one of three types:
  Add a pair (a, b) to the set.  Remove a pair added in the query number i. All queries are numbered with integers from 1 to n.  For a given integer q find the maximal value x·q + y over all pairs (x, y) from the set. Help Lena to process the queries.

Input
The first line of input contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) — the number of queries.
Each of the next n lines starts with integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 3) — the type of the query.
A pair of integers a and b ( - 10^9 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9) follows in the query of the first type.
An integer i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) follows in the query of the second type. It is guaranteed that i is less than the number of the query, the query number i has the first type and the pair from the i-th query is not already removed.
An integer q ( - 10^9 ≤ q ≤ 10^9) follows in the query of the third type.

Output
For the queries of the third type print on a separate line the desired maximal value of x·q + y.
If there are no pairs in the set print "EMPTY SET".
