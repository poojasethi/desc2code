A truncatable prime is a prime number which contains no zeros in decimal notation and all its suffixes are primes. 1 is considered to be not a prime.
You are given a positive integer †n‡. Figure out whether it is a truncatable prime.

Input
The only line of input contains an integer †n‡ (2 ≤ †n‡ ≤ 10^7).

Output
Output "YES" if †n‡ is a truncatable prime. Output "NO" otherwise. Quotes for clarity only.

Examples
Input
19

Output
NO

Input
9137

Output
YES


Note
In the first sample 19 is a prime but its suffix 9 is not.
In the second sample 9137, 137, 37 and 7 are all primes, so 9137 is a truncatable prime.
