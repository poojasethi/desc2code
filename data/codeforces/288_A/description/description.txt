Little penguin Polo adores strings. But most of all he adores strings of length n.
One day he wanted to find a string that meets the following conditions:
  The string consists of n lowercase English letters (that is, the string's length equals n), exactly k of these letters are distinct.  No two neighbouring letters of a string coincide; that is, if we represent a string as s = s1s2... sn, then the following inequality holds, si ≠ si + 1(1 ≤ i < n).  Among all strings that meet points 1 and 2, the required string is lexicographically smallest. Help him find such string or state that such string doesn't exist.
String x = x1x2... xp is lexicographically less than string y = y1y2... yq, if either p < q and x1 = y1, x2 = y2, ... , xp = yp, or there is such number r (r < p, r < q), that x1 = y1, x2 = y2, ... , xr = yr and xr + 1 < yr + 1. The characters of the strings are compared by their ASCII codes.

Input
A single line contains two positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ k ≤ 26) — the string's length and the number of distinct letters.

Output
In a single line print the required string. If there isn't such string, print "-1" (without the quotes).
