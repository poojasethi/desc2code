The positive integer †a‡ is a divisor of the positive integer †b‡ if and only if there exists a positive integer †c‡ such that †a‡ × †c‡ = †b‡. 
King Astyages thinks a positive integer †x‡ is extraordinarily nice if the number of its even divisors is equal to the number of its odd divisors.
For example 3 has two positive divisors 3 and 1, both of which are odd, so 3 is not extraordinarily nice. On the other hand 2 is only divisible by 2 and 1, so it has one odd and one even divisor. Therefore 2 is extraordinarily nice.
Given a positive integer †x‡ determine whether it's extraordinarily nice.

Input
The input contains only a single integer †x‡ (1 ≤ †x‡ ≤ 10^3).

Output
Write a single yes or no. Write yes if the number is extraordinarily nice and no otherwise.
You don't need to care about capital or small letters. The output is case-insensitive.

Examples
Input
2

Output
yes

Input
3

Output
no
