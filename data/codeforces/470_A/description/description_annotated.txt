Crystal ball sequence on hexagonal lattice is defined as follows: †n‡-th element is the number of lattice points inside a hexagon with (†n‡ + 1) points on each side. The formula is †H‡†n‡ = 3·†n‡·(†n‡ + 1) + 1. You are given †n‡; calculate †n‡-th element of the sequence.

Input
The only line of input contains an integer †n‡ (0 ≤ †n‡ ≤ 9).

Output
Output the †n‡-th element of crystal ball sequence.
