Sorting arrays is traditionally associated with high-level languages. How hard can it be in FALSE? Sort the given array in non-descending order.

Input
The input consists of a single line of space-separated integers. The first number is †n‡ (1 ≤ †n‡ ≤ 10) — the size of the array. The following †n‡ numbers are the elements of the array (1 ≤ †a‡†i‡ ≤ 100).

Output
Output space-separated elements of the sorted array.

Examples
Input
3 3 1 2

Output
1 2 3 

Input
7 12 2 3 44 5 60 2

Output
2 2 3 5 12 44 60
