Devu is a renowned classical singer. He is invited to many big functions/festivals. Recently he was invited to "All World Classical Singing Festival". Other than Devu, comedian Churu was also invited.
Devu has provided organizers a list of the songs and required time for singing them. He will sing †n‡ songs, †i‡^†th‡ song will take †t‡†i‡ minutes exactly. 
The Comedian, Churu will crack jokes. All his jokes are of 5 minutes exactly.
People have mainly come to listen Devu. But you know that he needs rest of 10 minutes after each song. On the other hand, Churu being a very active person, doesn't need any rest.
You as one of the organizers should make an optimal sсhedule for the event. For some reasons you must follow the conditions:
  The duration of the event must be no more than †d‡ minutes;  Devu must complete all his songs;  With satisfying the two previous conditions the number of jokes cracked by Churu should be as many as possible. If it is not possible to find a way to conduct all the songs of the Devu, output -1. Otherwise find out maximum number of jokes that Churu can crack in the grand event.

Input
The first line contains two space separated integers †n‡, †d‡ (1 ≤ †n‡ ≤ 100; 1 ≤ †d‡ ≤ 10000). The second line contains †n‡ space-separated integers: †t‡1, †t‡2, ..., †t‡†n‡ (1 ≤ †t‡†i‡ ≤ 100).

Output
If there is no way to conduct all the songs of Devu, output -1. Otherwise output the maximum number of jokes that Churu can crack in the grand event.

Examples
Input
3 30
2 2 1

Output
5

Input
3 20
2 1 1

Output
-1


Note
Consider the first example. The duration of the event is 30 minutes. There could be maximum 5 jokes in the following way:
  First Churu cracks a joke in 5 minutes.  Then Devu performs the first song for 2 minutes.  Then Churu cracks 2 jokes in 10 minutes.  Now Devu performs second song for 2 minutes.  Then Churu cracks 2 jokes in 10 minutes.  Now finally Devu will perform his last song in 1 minutes.  Total time spent is 5 + 2 + 10 + 2 + 10 + 1 = 30 minutes.
Consider the second example. There is no way of organizing Devu's all songs. Hence the answer is -1.
