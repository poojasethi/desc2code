Valera loves segments. He has recently come up with one interesting problem.
The †Ox‡ axis of coordinates has †n‡ segments, the †i‡-th segment starts in position †l‡†i‡ and ends in position †r‡†i‡ (we will mark it as [†l‡†i‡, †r‡†i‡]). Your task is to process †m‡ queries, each consists of number †cnt‡†i‡ and a set of †cnt‡†i‡ coordinates of points located on the †Ox‡ axis. The answer to the query is the number of segments, such that each of them contains at least one point from the query. Segment [†l‡, †r‡] contains point †q‡, if †l‡ ≤ †q‡ ≤ †r‡.
Valera found the solution of this problem too difficult. So he asked you to help him. Help Valera. 

Input
The first line contains two integers †n‡, †m‡ (1 ≤ †n‡, †m‡ ≤ 3·10^5) — the number of segments on the axis of coordinates and the number of queries. 
Next †n‡ lines contain the descriptions of the segments. The †i‡-th line contains two positive integers †l‡†i‡, †r‡†i‡ (1 ≤ †l‡†i‡ ≤ †r‡†i‡ ≤ 10^6) — the borders of the †i‡-th segment.
Next †m‡ lines contain the description of the queries, one per line. Each line starts from integer †cnt‡†i‡ (1 ≤ †cnt‡†i‡ ≤ 3·10^5) — the number of points in the †i‡-th query. Then the line contains †cnt‡†i‡ distinct positive integers †p‡1, †p‡2, ..., †p‡†cnt‡†i‡ (1 ≤ †p‡1 < †p‡2 < ... < †p‡†cnt‡†i‡ ≤ 10^6) — the coordinates of points in the †i‡-th query.
It is guaranteed that the total number of points in all queries doesn't exceed 3·10^5. 

Output
Print †m‡ non-negative integers, where the †i‡-th number is the response to the †i‡-th query.
