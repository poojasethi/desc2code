Kefa decided to make some money doing business on the Internet for exactly n days. He knows that on the i-th day (1 ≤ i ≤ n) he makes ai money. Kefa loves progress, that's why he wants to know the length of the maximum non-decreasing subsegment in sequence ai. Let us remind you that the subsegment of the sequence is its continuous fragment. A subsegment of numbers is called non-decreasing if all numbers in it follow in the non-decreasing order.
Help Kefa cope with this task!

Input
The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).
The second line contains n integers a1,  a2,  ...,  an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9).

Output
Print a single integer — the length of the maximum non-decreasing subsegment of sequence a.

Examples
Input
6
2 2 1 3 4 1

Output

Input
3
2 2 9

Output
3


Note
In the first test the maximum non-decreasing subsegment is the numbers from the third to the fifth one.
In the second test the maximum non-decreasing subsegment is the numbers from the first to the third one.
