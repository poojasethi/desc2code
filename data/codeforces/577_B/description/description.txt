You are given a sequence of numbers a1, a2, ..., an, and a number m.
Check if it is possible to choose a non-empty subsequence aij such that the sum of numbers in this subsequence is divisible by m.

Input
The first line contains two numbers, n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^3) — the size of the original sequence and the number such that sum should be divisible by it.
The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9).

Output
In the single line print either "YES" (without the quotes) if there exists the sought subsequence, or "NO" (without the quotes), if such subsequence doesn't exist.

Examples
Input
3 5
1 2 3

Output
YES

Input
1 6
5

Output
NO

Input
4 6
3 1 1 3

Output
YES

Input
6 6
5 5 5 5 5 5

Output
YES


Note
In the first sample test you can choose numbers 2 and 3, the sum of which is divisible by 5.
In the second sample test the single non-empty subsequence of numbers is a single number 5. Number 5 is not divisible by 6, that is, the sought subsequence doesn't exist.
In the third sample test you need to choose two numbers 3 on the ends.
In the fourth sample test you can take the whole subsequence.
