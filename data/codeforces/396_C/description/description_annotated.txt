You are given a rooted tree consisting of †n‡ vertices numbered from 1 to †n‡. The root of the tree is a vertex number 1.
Initially all vertices contain number 0. Then come †q‡ queries, each query has one of the two types:
  The format of the query: 1 †v‡ †x‡ †k‡. In response to the query, you need to add to the number at vertex †v‡ number †x‡; to the numbers at the descendants of vertex †v‡ at distance 1, add †x‡ - †k‡; and so on, to the numbers written in the descendants of vertex †v‡ at distance †i‡, you need to add †x‡ - (†i‡·†k‡). The distance between two vertices is the number of edges in the shortest path between these vertices.  The format of the query: 2 †v‡. In reply to the query you should print the number written in vertex †v‡ modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7). Process the queries given in the input.

Input
The first line contains integer †n‡ (1 ≤ †n‡ ≤ 3·10^5) — the number of vertices in the tree. The second line contains †n‡ - 1 integers †p‡2, †p‡3, ... †p‡†n‡ (1 ≤ †p‡†i‡ < †i‡), where †p‡†i‡ is the number of the vertex that is the parent of vertex †i‡ in the tree.
The third line contains integer †q‡ (1 ≤ †q‡ ≤ 3·10^5) — the number of queries. Next †q‡ lines contain the queries, one per line. The first number in the line is †type‡. It represents the type of the query. If †type‡ = 1, then next follow space-separated integers †v‡, †x‡, †k‡ (1 ≤ †v‡ ≤ †n‡; 0 ≤ †x‡ < 10^9 + 7; 0 ≤ †k‡ < 10^9 + 7). If †type‡ = 2, then next follows integer †v‡ (1 ≤ †v‡ ≤ †n‡) — the vertex where you need to find the value of the number.

Output
For each query of the second type print on a single line the number written in the vertex from the query. Print the number modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7).
