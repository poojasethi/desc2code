On a history lesson the teacher asked Vasya to name the dates when n famous events took place. He doesn't remembers the exact dates but he remembers a segment of days [li, ri] (inclusive) on which the event could have taken place. However Vasya also remembers that there was at most one event in one day. Help him choose such n dates of famous events that will fulfill both conditions. It is guaranteed that it is possible.

Input
The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of known events. Then follow n lines containing two integers li and ri each (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 10^7) — the earliest acceptable date and the latest acceptable date of the i-th event.

Output
Print n numbers — the dates on which the events took place. If there are several solutions, print any of them. It is guaranteed that a solution exists.
