"Contestant who earns a score equal to or greater than the †k‡-th place finisher's score will advance to the next round, as long as the contestant earns a positive score..." — an excerpt from contest rules.
A total of †n‡ participants took part in the contest (†n‡ ≥ †k‡), and you already know their scores. Calculate how many participants will advance to the next round.

Input
The first line of the input contains two integers †n‡ and †k‡ (1 ≤ †k‡ ≤ †n‡ ≤ 50) separated by a single space.
The second line contains †n‡ space-separated integers †a‡1, †a‡2, ..., †a‡†n‡ (0 ≤ †a‡†i‡ ≤ 100), where †a‡†i‡ is the score earned by the participant who got the †i‡-th place. The given sequence is non-increasing (that is, for all †i‡ from 1 to †n‡ - 1 the following condition is fulfilled: †a‡†i‡ ≥ †a‡†i‡ + 1).

Output
Output the number of participants who advance to the next round.

Examples
Input
8 5
10 9 8 7 7 7 5 5

Output
6

Input
4 2
0 0 0 0

Output
0


Note
In the first example the participant on the 5th place earned 7 points. As the participant on the 6th place also earned 7 points, there are 6 advancers.
In the second example nobody got a positive score.
