Let us remind you part of the rules of Codeforces. The given rules slightly simplified, use the problem statement as a formal document.
In the beginning of the round the contestants are divided into rooms. Each room contains exactly †n‡ participants. During the contest the participants are suggested to solve five problems, †A‡, †B‡, †C‡, †D‡ and †E‡. For each of these problem, depending on when the given problem was solved and whether it was solved at all, the participants receive some points. Besides, a contestant can perform hacks on other contestants. For each successful hack a contestant earns 100 points, for each unsuccessful hack a contestant loses 50 points. The number of points for every contestant is represented by the sum of points he has received from all his problems, including hacks.
You are suggested to determine the leader for some room; the leader is a participant who has maximum points.

Input
The first line contains an integer †n‡, which is the number of contestants in the room (1 ≤ †n‡ ≤ 50). The next †n‡ lines contain the participants of a given room. The †i‡-th line has the format of "†handle‡†i‡ †plus‡†i‡ †minus‡†i‡ †a‡†i‡ †b‡†i‡ †c‡†i‡ †d‡†i‡ †e‡†i‡" — it is the handle of a contestant, the number of successful hacks, the number of unsuccessful hacks and the number of points he has received from problems †A‡, †B‡, †C‡, †D‡, †E‡ correspondingly. The handle of each participant consists of Latin letters, digits and underscores and has the length from 1 to 20 characters. There are the following limitations imposed upon the numbers: 
  0 ≤ †plus‡†i‡, †minus‡†i‡ ≤ 50;  150 ≤ †a‡†i‡ ≤ 500 or †a‡†i‡ = 0, if problem †A‡ is not solved;  300 ≤ †b‡†i‡ ≤ 1000 or †b‡†i‡ = 0, if problem †B‡ is not solved;  450 ≤ †c‡†i‡ ≤ 1500 or †c‡†i‡ = 0, if problem †C‡ is not solved;  600 ≤ †d‡†i‡ ≤ 2000 or †d‡†i‡ = 0, if problem †D‡ is not solved;  750 ≤ †e‡†i‡ ≤ 2500 or †e‡†i‡ = 0, if problem †E‡ is not solved. All the numbers are integer. All the participants have different handles. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one leader in the room (i.e. there are no two participants with the maximal number of points).

Output
Print on the single line the handle of the room leader.

Examples
Input
5
Petr 3 1 490 920 1000 1200 0
tourist 2 0 490 950 1100 1400 0
Egor 7 0 480 900 950 0 1000
c00lH4x0R 0 10 150 0 0 0 0
some_participant 2 1 450 720 900 0 0

Output
tourist


Note
The number of points that each participant from the example earns, are as follows: 
  Petr — 3860  tourist — 4140  Egor — 4030  c00lH4x0R —  - 350  some_participant — 2220 Thus, the leader of the room is tourist.
