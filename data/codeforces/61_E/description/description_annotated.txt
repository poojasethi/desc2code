The Romans have attacked again. This time they are much more than the Persians but Shapur is ready to defeat them. He says: "A lion is never afraid of a hundred sheep". 
Nevertheless Shapur has to find weaknesses in the Roman army to defeat them. So he gives the army a weakness number.
In Shapur's opinion the weakness of an army is equal to the number of triplets †i‡, †j‡, †k‡ such that †i‡ < †j‡ < †k‡ and †a‡†i‡ > †a‡†j‡ > †a‡†k‡ where †a‡†x‡ is the power of man standing at position †x‡. The Roman army has one special trait — powers of all the people in it are distinct.
Help Shapur find out how weak the Romans are.

Input
The first line of input contains a single number †n‡ (3 ≤ †n‡ ≤ 10^6) — the number of men in Roman army. Next line contains †n‡ different positive integers †a‡†i‡ (1 ≤ †i‡ ≤ †n‡, 1 ≤ †a‡†i‡ ≤ 10^9) — powers of men in the Roman army. 

Output
A single integer number, the weakness of the Roman army. 
Please, do not use %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preffered to use cout (also you may use %I64d).
