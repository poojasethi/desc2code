Polycarpus got hold of a family tree. The found tree describes the family relations of n people, numbered from 1 to n. Every person in this tree has at most one direct ancestor. Also, each person in the tree has a name, the names are not necessarily unique.
We call the man with a number a a 1-ancestor of the man with a number b, if the man with a number a is a direct ancestor of the man with a number b.
We call the man with a number a a k-ancestor (k > 1) of the man with a number b, if the man with a number b has a 1-ancestor, and the man with a number a is a (k - 1)-ancestor of the 1-ancestor of the man with a number b.
In the tree the family ties do not form cycles. In other words there isn't a person who is his own direct or indirect ancestor (that is, who is an x-ancestor of himself, for some x, x > 0).
We call a man with a number a the k-son of the man with a number b, if the man with a number b is a k-ancestor of the man with a number a.
Polycarpus is very much interested in how many sons and which sons each person has. He took a piece of paper and wrote m pairs of numbers vi, ki. Help him to learn for each pair vi, ki the number of distinct names among all names of the ki-sons of the man with number vi.

Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of people in the tree. Next n lines contain the description of people in the tree. The i-th line contains space-separated string si and integer ri (0 ≤ ri ≤ n), where si is the name of the man with a number i, and ri is either the number of the direct ancestor of the man with a number i or 0, if the man with a number i has no direct ancestor. 
The next line contains a single integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5) — the number of Polycarpus's records. Next m lines contain space-separated pairs of integers. The i-th line contains integers vi, ki (1 ≤ vi, ki ≤ n).
It is guaranteed that the family relationships do not form cycles. The names of all people are non-empty strings, consisting of no more than 20 lowercase English letters.

Output
Print m whitespace-separated integers — the answers to Polycarpus's records. Print the answers to the records in the order, in which the records occur in the input.
