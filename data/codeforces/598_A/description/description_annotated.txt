In this problem you are to calculate the sum of all integers from 1 to †n‡, but you should take all powers of two with minus in the sum.
For example, for †n‡ = 4 the sum is equal to  - 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 =  - 4, because 1, 2 and 4 are 2^0, 2^1 and 2^2 respectively.
Calculate the answer for †t‡ values of †n‡.

Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer †t‡ (1 ≤ †t‡ ≤ 100) — the number of values of †n‡ to be processed.
Each of next †t‡ lines contains a single integer †n‡ (1 ≤ †n‡ ≤ 10^9).

Output
Print the requested sum for each of †t‡ integers †n‡ given in the input.
