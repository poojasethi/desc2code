Polycarp loves geometric progressions — he collects them. However, as such progressions occur very rarely, he also loves the sequences of numbers where it is enough to delete a single element to get a geometric progression.
In this task we shall define geometric progressions as finite sequences of numbers a1, a2, ..., ak, where ai = c·b^i-1 for some real numbers c and b. For example, the sequences [2, -4, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0], [199] are geometric progressions and [0, 1, 2, 3] is not.
Recently Polycarp has found a sequence and he can't classify it. Help him to do it. Determine whether it is a geometric progression. If it is not, check if it can become a geometric progression if an element is deleted from it.

Input
The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of elements in the given sequence. The second line contains the given sequence. The numbers are space-separated. All the elements of the given sequence are integers and their absolute value does not exceed 10^4.

Output
Print 0, if the given sequence is a geometric progression. Otherwise, check if it is possible to make the sequence a geometric progression by deleting a single element. If it is possible, print 1. If it is impossible, print 2.
