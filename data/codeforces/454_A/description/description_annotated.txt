Twilight Sparkle once got a crystal from the Crystal Mine. A crystal of size †n‡ (†n‡ is odd; †n‡ > 1) is an †n‡ × †n‡ matrix with a diamond inscribed into it.
You are given an odd integer †n‡. You need to draw a crystal of size †n‡. The diamond cells of the matrix should be represented by character "D". All other cells of the matrix should be represented by character "*". Look at the examples to understand what you need to draw.

Input
The only line contains an integer †n‡ (3 ≤ †n‡ ≤ 101; †n‡ is odd). 

Output
Output a crystal of size †n‡.
