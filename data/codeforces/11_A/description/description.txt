A sequence a0, a1, ..., at - 1 is called increasing if ai - 1 < ai for each i: 0 < i < t.
You are given a sequence b0, b1, ..., bn - 1 and a positive integer d. In each move you may choose one element of the given sequence and add d to it. What is the least number of moves required to make the given sequence increasing?

Input
The first line of the input contains two integer numbers n and d (2 ≤ n ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^6). The second line contains space separated sequence b0, b1, ..., bn - 1 (1 ≤ bi ≤ 10^6).

Output
Output the minimal number of moves needed to make the sequence increasing.

Examples
