A sequence †a‡0, †a‡1, ..., †a‡†t‡ - 1 is called increasing if †a‡†i‡ - 1 < †a‡†i‡ for each †i‡: 0 < †i‡ < †t‡.
You are given a sequence †b‡0, †b‡1, ..., †b‡†n‡ - 1 and a positive integer †d‡. In each move you may choose one element of the given sequence and add †d‡ to it. What is the least number of moves required to make the given sequence increasing?

Input
The first line of the input contains two integer numbers †n‡ and †d‡ (2 ≤ †n‡ ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ †d‡ ≤ 10^6). The second line contains space separated sequence †b‡0, †b‡1, ..., †b‡†n‡ - 1 (1 ≤ †b‡†i‡ ≤ 10^6).

Output
Output the minimal number of moves needed to make the sequence increasing.
