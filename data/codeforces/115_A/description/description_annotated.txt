A company has †n‡ employees numbered from 1 to †n‡. Each employee either has no immediate manager or exactly one immediate manager, who is another employee with a different number. An employee †A‡ is said to be the superior of another employee †B‡ if at least one of the following is true:
  Employee †A‡ is the immediate manager of employee †B‡  Employee †B‡ has an immediate manager employee †C‡ such that employee †A‡ is the superior of employee †C‡. The company will not have a managerial cycle. That is, there will not exist an employee who is the superior of his/her own immediate manager.
Today the company is going to arrange a party. This involves dividing all †n‡ employees into several groups: every employee must belong to exactly one group. Furthermore, within any single group, there must not be two employees †A‡ and †B‡ such that †A‡ is the superior of †B‡.
What is the minimum number of groups that must be formed?

Input
The first line contains integer †n‡ (1 ≤ †n‡ ≤ 2000) — the number of employees.
The next †n‡ lines contain the integers †p‡†i‡ (1 ≤ †p‡†i‡ ≤ †n‡ or †p‡†i‡ = -1). Every †p‡†i‡ denotes the immediate manager for the †i‡-th employee. If †p‡†i‡ is -1, that means that the †i‡-th employee does not have an immediate manager. 
It is guaranteed, that no employee will be the immediate manager of him/herself (†p‡†i‡ ≠ †i‡). Also, there will be no managerial cycles.

Output
Print a single integer denoting the minimum number of groups that will be formed in the party.

Examples
Input
5
-1
1

Output
3


Note
For the first example, three groups are sufficient, for example: 
  Employee 1  Employees 2 and 4  Employees 3 and 5
